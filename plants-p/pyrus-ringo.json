    "intro": "Pyrus ringo, commonly known as the apple tree, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by fruits that ripen in late summer. The apple fruit is typically round, with a smooth skin that can vary in color from red to green or yellow. Pyrus ringo is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and has been a significant crop in human agriculture for thousands of years."
