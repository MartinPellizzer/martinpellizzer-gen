    "intro": "Polygonum paralimicola, commonly known as the limicola polygonum, is a species of flowering plant in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
