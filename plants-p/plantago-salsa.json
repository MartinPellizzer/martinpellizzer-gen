    "intro": "Plantago salsa, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are often curled and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
