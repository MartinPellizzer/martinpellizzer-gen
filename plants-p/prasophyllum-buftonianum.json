    "intro": "Prasophyllum buftonianum, commonly known as the Broughton's leek orchid, is an endemic plant species found in the alpine regions of Tasmania. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial species that produces a single flowering stem each year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
