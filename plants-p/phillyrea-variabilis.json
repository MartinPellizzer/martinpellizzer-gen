    "intro": "Phillyrea variabilis, commonly known as the variable Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, blue-black berries. Phillyrea variabilis is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal and arid environments. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
