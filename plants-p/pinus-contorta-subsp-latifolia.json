    "intro": "Pinus contorta subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the lodgepole pine, is a coniferous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green and later turn brown, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including mountainous regions and boreal forests, and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is particularly notable for its resilience and ability to regenerate after wildfires."
