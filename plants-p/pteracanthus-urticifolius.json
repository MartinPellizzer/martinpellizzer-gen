    "intro": "Pteracanthus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which secrete an irritating chemical causing a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with hollow, smooth stems. Due to its defensive mechanisms, it is often avoided by herbivores, though it serves as a host for certain insects and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
