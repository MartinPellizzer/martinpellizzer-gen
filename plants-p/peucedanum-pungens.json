    "intro": "Peucedanum pungens, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to two feet in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which are followed by small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found near streams, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Peucedanum pungens has a distinctive, often unpleasant odor and is known for its irritant properties when touched."
