    "intro": "Poa pseudopratensis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa pseudopratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
