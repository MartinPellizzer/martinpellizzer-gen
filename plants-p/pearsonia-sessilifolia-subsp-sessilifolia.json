It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
