    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis subsp. moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to the Moluccas and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
