    "intro": "Panicum burkartii, commonly known as the Burkart's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
