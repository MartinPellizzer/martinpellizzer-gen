    "intro": "Pilea lucens subsp. lucens, commonly known as the shining pilea, is a compact, low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are slightly notched at the base. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its elegant appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
