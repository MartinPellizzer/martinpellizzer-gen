    "intro": "Phyllanthus tireliae, commonly known as the mountain phyllanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
