    "intro": "Pyrethrum sorbifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular florets surrounded by a ring of larger, petal-like rays. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lobed, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum sorbifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential insecticidal properties."
