It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
