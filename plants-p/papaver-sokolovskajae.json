    "intro": "Papaver sokolovskajae, commonly known as the Sokolovskaja poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive blackened center. It produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
