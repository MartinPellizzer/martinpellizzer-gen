    "intro": "Pleurothallis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Pleurothallis dichotoma is notable for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
