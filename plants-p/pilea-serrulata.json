    "intro": "Pilea serrulata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Pilea serrulata is valued for its ornamental foliage and ease of care, though it can be somewhat slow-growing."
