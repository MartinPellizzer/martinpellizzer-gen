    "intro": "Polypodium sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Seychelles. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable."
