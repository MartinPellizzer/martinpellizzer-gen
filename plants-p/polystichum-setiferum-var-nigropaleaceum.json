    "intro": "Polystichum setiferum var. nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a variant of the hairy wood fern characterized by its distinctive dark green fronds with prominent black veins. It is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. The fronds are bipinnate, with narrow, elongated pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique vein coloration makes it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
