    "intro": "Pedicularis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to red, are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Pedicularis japonica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows."
