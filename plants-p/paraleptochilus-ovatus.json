    "intro": "Paraleptochilus ovatus, commonly known as the oval leathery liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green and closely adherent to surfaces such as rocks or soil. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on a system of specialized cells for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the underside of the thallus. Paraleptochilus ovatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions."
