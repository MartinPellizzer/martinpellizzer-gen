    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian black pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark bark and long, needle-like leaves. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It produces cone-shaped seed-bearing structures that release winged seeds for dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
