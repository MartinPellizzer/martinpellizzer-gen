    "intro": "Pleurothallis melanoglossa, commonly known as the black-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. This orchid is often epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
