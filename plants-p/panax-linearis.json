    "intro": "Panax linearis, commonly known as the linear ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species of the ginseng genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots, though not as commercially valuable as those of Panax ginseng, are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax linearis is considered a vulnerable species."
