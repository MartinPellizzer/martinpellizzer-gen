    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis var. glabrata, commonly known as the Washington sycamode, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled pattern of green, white, and brown. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it relies on wind pollination. The fruit is a fuzzy, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
