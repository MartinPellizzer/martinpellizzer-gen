    "intro": "Parathesis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a flowering plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, resembling dandelion flowers, but it is not related to the true dandelion. Parathesis is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties."
