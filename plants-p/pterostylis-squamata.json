    "intro": "Pterostylis squamata, commonly known as the scalloped greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a single, greenish-brown flower. The flower has a distinctive hood-like structure with a scalloped edge, and it is typically pollinated by thynnid wasps. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
