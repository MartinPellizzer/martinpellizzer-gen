    "intro": "Pteris wallichiana var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest understories. This variety is distinguished by its more rounded and broader leaflets compared to the typical form of Pteris wallichiana."
