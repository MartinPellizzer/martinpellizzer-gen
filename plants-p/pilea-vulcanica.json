    "intro": "Pilea vulcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Pilea, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial with heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea vulcanica is valued for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
