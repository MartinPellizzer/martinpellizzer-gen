    "intro": "Podospermum muricatum var. spurinum, commonly known as the spiny podo, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
