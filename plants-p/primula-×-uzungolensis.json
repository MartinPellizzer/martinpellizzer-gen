    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 uzungolensis, commonly known as the Uzungo primrose, is a hybrid plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
