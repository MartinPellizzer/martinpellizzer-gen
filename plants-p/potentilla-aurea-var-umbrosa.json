    "intro": "Potentilla aurea var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in less-than-ideal light conditions."
