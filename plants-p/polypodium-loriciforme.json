    "intro": "Polypodium loriciforme, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, thick rhizomes that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant has a distinctive, shield-like appearance due to its dense, overlapping fronds. It typically grows on rocks or trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it a resilient and adaptable species."
