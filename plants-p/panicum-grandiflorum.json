    "intro": "Panicum grandiflorum, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and striking purple-tinted flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
