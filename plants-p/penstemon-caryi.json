    "intro": "Penstemon caryi, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Penstemon caryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
