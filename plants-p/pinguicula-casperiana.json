    "intro": "Pinguicula casperiana, commonly known as the Casper's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its rosette of short, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
