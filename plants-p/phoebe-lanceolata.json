    "intro": "Phoebe lanceolata, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant, wintergreen-like scent when scratched. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate in shape, with a doubly serrated margin. Phoebe lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
