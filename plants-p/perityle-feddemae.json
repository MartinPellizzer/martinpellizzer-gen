    "intro": "Perityle feddemae, commonly known as the Fedde's perityle, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perityle feddemae is considered a vulnerable species."
