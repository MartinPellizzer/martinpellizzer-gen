    "intro": "Poincianella pluviosa var. peltophoroides, commonly known as the red-veined or red-stemmed poincianella, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with red veins and a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities."
