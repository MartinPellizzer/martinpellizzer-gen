It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris navarrensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
