    "intro": "Poa oraria, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Poa oraria is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
