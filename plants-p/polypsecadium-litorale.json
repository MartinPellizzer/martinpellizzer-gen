It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Polypsecadium litorale is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in brackish or saline environments."
