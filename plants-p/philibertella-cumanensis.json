    "intro": "Philibertella cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis Philibertella, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
