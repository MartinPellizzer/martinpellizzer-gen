    "intro": "Parnassia xinganensis, commonly known as the Xingan mountain buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parnassia xinganensis is considered a vulnerable species."
