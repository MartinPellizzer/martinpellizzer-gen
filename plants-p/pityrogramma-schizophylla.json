    "intro": "Pityrogramma schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are typically short and branched, and the fronds are usually submerged or floating. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
