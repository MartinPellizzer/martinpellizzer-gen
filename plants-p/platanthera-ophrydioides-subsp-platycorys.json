    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides subsp. platycorys, commonly known as the broad-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often leafless stem that bears a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It has a short root system and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader lip and more robust floral structure compared to other members of the species."
