    "intro": "Pogonia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in acidic, peaty soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single basal leaf and a cluster of showy, pinkish-purple flowers. Its inflorescence consists of two to three flowers, each with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions."
