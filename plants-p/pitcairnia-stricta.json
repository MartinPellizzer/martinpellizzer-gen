    "intro": "Pitcairnia stricta, commonly known as the rigid pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branching spike that bears small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Pitcairnia stricta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
