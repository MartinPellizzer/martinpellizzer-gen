    "intro": "Primula atrotubata, commonly known as the black-tubed primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dark purple to black tubular flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
