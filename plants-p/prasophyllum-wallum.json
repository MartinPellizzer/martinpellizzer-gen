    "intro": "Prasophyllum wallum, commonly known as the Wallum leek orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or heathy soils, often in heathlands or coastal dunes. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Prasophyllum wallum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
