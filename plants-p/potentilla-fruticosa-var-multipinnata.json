    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. multipinnata, commonly known as the multibract potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with multiple pairs of leaflets that give the plant its \"multipinnata\" designation. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with full sun exposure. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature in harsh environments."
