    "intro": "Pleurothallis jungermannioides, commonly known as the Jungermann's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is often found epiphytically on trees, where it relies on the host for support rather than soil."
