    "intro": "Pedicularis rex subsp. pseudocyathus, commonly known as the King's Crown, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its most distinctive feature is its vivid red, spurred flowers that resemble a crown, hence its common name. The plant is relatively rare and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
