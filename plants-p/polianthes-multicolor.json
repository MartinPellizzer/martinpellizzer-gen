    "intro": "Polianthes multicolor, commonly known as the rainbow onion, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white, often arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. The plant produces a strong, garlicky odor when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks during the growing season."
