    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subvar. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a characteristic common among the Lentibulariaceae family. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
