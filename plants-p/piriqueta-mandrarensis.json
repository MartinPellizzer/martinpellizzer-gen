    "intro": "Piriqueta mandrarensis, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a coniferous tree belonging to the Cupressaceae family, characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat, with a slow growth rate and deep root system. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the island's biodiversity."
