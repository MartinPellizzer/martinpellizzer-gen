    "intro": "Panicum kunthianum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for cotton or other soft materials. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
