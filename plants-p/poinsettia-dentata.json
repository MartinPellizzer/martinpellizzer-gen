    "intro": "Poinsettia dentata, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Poinsettia dentata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season."
