    "intro": "Paspalum nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy blades. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and riparian areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which produces small, two-lobed flowers. Paspalum nelsonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
