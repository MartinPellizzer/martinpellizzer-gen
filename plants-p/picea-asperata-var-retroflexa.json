    "intro": "Picea asperata var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex spruce, is a variant of the asperata spruce, characterized by its unique cone and leaf morphology. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in parts of China and Nepal. The leaves are typically short, stiff, and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Its cones are often pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
