    "intro": "Polycarpon prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate nightshade, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. Polycarpon prostratum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts."
