    "intro": "Poa supina var. racemosa, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
