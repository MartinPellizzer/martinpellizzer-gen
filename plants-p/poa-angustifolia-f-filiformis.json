    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. filiformis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a variant of the narrowleaf bentgrass species. It is characterized by its very fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. This form is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a low-growing habit and forms dense, carpet-like mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
