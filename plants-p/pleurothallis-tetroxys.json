    "intro": "Pleurothallis tetroxys, commonly known as the four-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green, with a unique structure that includes four prominent spurred petals. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces numerous small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often difficult to cultivate outside its native range."
