    "intro": "Piriqueta sidifolia var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora piriqueta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, aiding in water retention. This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
