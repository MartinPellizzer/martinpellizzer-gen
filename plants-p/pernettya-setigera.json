    "intro": "Pernettya setigera, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Pernettya setigera thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
