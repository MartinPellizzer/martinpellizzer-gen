    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. kitaibelii, commonly known as the Kitaibel's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and meadows. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical structures bearing the flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
