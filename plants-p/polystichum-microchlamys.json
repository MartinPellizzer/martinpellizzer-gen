    "intro": "Polystichum microchlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum microchlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
