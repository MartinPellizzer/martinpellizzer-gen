    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, white fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
