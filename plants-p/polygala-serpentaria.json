    "intro": "Polygala serpentaria, commonly known as serpent's root, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in moist, woodland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Serpent's root is often found in shaded areas and can thrive in partially wet soils."
