    "intro": "Portulaca portulacastrum, commonly known as the moss rose, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to tolerate drought conditions is due to its thick, waxy leaf surface that reduces water loss. Portulaca portulacastrum is also known for its ability to self-seed, ensuring its presence in gardens year after year."
