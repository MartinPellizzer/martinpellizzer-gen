    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis frutescens, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ptyssiglottis frutescens is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
