    "intro": "Paramammea megaphylla, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large tropical fern characterized by its expansive, broad fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome with tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
