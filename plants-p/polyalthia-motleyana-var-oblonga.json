    "intro": "Polyalthia motleyana var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf evergreen tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are often followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader and more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Polyalthia motleyana."
