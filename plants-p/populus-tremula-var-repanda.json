    "intro": "Populus tremula var. repanda, commonly known as the trembling aspen or European aspen, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in forest stands."
