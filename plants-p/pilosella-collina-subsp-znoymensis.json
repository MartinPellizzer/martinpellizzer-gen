    "intro": "Pilosella collina subsp. znoymensis, commonly known as the Znoymensk pilosella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
