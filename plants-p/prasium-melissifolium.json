    "intro": "Prasium melissifolium, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, opposite leaves that are often described as having a lemony scent due to the presence of volatile oils.

Its leaves are widely used in herbal medicine for their calming properties and are also popular in culinary applications.
