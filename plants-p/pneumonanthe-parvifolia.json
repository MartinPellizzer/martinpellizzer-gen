    "intro": "Pneumonanthe parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lungwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
