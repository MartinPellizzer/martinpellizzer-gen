    "intro": "Phelypaea tricholoba, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name and aid in water retention. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
