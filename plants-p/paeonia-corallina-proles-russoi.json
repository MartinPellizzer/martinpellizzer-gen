    "intro": "Paeonia corallina proles russoi, commonly known as the Russo's coral peony, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, coral-red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its foliage consists of large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical and horticultural value."
