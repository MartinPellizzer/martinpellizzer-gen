    "intro": "Polycarpaea lignosa, commonly known as the hardy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem, which gives it its species name \"lignosa,\" meaning wood-like. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Polycarpaea lignosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
