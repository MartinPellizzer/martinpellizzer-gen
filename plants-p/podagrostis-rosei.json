    "intro": "Podagrostis rosei, commonly known as the rose barrengrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Podagrostis rosei is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
