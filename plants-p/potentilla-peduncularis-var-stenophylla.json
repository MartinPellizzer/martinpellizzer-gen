It features narrow, elliptic leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
