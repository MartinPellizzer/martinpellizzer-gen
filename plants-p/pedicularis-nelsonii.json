It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. Pedicularis nelsonii is a relatively rare species, often found in alpine environments where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
