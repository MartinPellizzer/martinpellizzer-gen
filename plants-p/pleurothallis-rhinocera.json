    "intro": "Pleurothallis rhinocera, commonly known as the rhinoceros orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. The plant's morphology includes narrow, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
