    "intro": "Portulaca lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy moss rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to hot, dry environments. Portulaca lanuginosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
