    "intro": "Pterospermum argenteum, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
