    "intro": "Prosopis nigra var. ragonesei, commonly known as the Ragonese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, flat pods containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
