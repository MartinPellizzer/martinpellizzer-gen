    "intro": "Phrynium grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive red or purple spathe. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root crop, similar to taro, and it is valued for both its culinary and ornamental qualities. Phrynium grandiflorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
