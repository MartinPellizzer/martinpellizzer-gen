    "intro": "Polypodium subandinum var. biserialis, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are leathery and have a distinctive biserial arrangement of pinnae, which is a key identifying feature."
