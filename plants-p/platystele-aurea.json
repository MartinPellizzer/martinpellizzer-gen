    "intro": "Platystele aurea, commonly known as the golden platystele, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, tubular stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragility and limited distribution, Platystele aurea is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
