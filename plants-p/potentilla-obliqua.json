    "intro": "Potentilla obliqua, commonly known as the bent willow or zigzag cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems that curve and twist, giving it a distinctive, zigzag appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, with a rounded or ovate shape and a hairy texture. Potentilla obliqua thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and wet meadows."
