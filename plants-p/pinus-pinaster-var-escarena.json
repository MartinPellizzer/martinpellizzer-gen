    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. escarena, commonly known as the Escar\u00e8ne pine, is a variant of the Maritime pine native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The cones of this variety are generally smaller and more elongated compared to the typical Maritime pine. It thrives in coastal and Mediterranean climates, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
