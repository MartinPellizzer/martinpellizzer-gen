    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. pseudoconcinna, commonly known as the slender bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces bulbous structures that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
