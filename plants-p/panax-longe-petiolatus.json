    "intro": "Panax longe-petiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its long, slender petioles and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbellate clusters, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Due to its rarity and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
