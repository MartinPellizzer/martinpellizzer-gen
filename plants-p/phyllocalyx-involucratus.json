    "intro": "Phyllocalyx involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
