    "intro": "Poa kirkii var. auklandica, commonly known as the Auckland grass, is a variant of the Poa kirkii species native to New Zealand. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological variations compared to the typical Poa kirkii, including differences in leaf structure and flowering patterns."
