    "intro": "Pinaropappus caespitosus, commonly known as the hairy pappus grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a common feature in the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Pinaropappus caespitosus plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in disturbed or sandy environments."
