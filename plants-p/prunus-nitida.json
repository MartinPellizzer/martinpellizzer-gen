    "intro": "Prunus nitida, commonly known as the Italian cherry or thorned cherry, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red or pink fruits called drupes. Prunus nitida is well-suited for ornamental use due to its attractive form and tolerance to urban conditions. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
