    "intro": "Polygonatum verticillatum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf Solomon's seal, is a variant of the Solomon's seal plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more clustered leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Its foliage and floral display make it a desirable addition to moist, partially shaded landscapes."
