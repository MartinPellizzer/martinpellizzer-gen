    "intro": "Pteris brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Pteris brooksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
