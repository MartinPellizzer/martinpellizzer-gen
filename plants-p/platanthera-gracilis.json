    "intro": "Platanthera gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist woodlands and meadows in North America. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, spirally twisted flower spike that bears small, white to pale green flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Platanthera gracilis is considered a rare and sensitive species, often indicating high-quality, undisturbed habitats."
