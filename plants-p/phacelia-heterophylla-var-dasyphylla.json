    "intro": "Phacelia heterophylla var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that vary in shape, often becoming more lobed as the plant matures. The species produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
