    "intro": "Phemeranthus greenmanii, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy, white or pink flowers that bloom briefly in the spring. The plant is typically found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Due to its short blooming period, it is a rare and ephemeral species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts."
