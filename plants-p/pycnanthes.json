    "intro": "Pycnanthes, commonly known as the \"Chinese frankincense tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Many species produce aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
