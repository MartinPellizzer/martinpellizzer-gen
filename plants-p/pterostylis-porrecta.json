    "intro": "Pterostylis porrecta, commonly known as the straight-styled duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect flower spike that bears a single, greenish-white flower. Its morphology is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with a well-developed scape and a labellum that is often modified for pollination. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
