    "intro": "Pinus flexilis subsp. reflexa, commonly known as the creeping mountain pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are small and often remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
