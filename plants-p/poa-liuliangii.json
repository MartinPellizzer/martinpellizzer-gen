    "intro": "Poa liuliangii, commonly known as the Liuliang bentgrass, is a species of grass native to China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect blades. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, Poa liuliangii is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
