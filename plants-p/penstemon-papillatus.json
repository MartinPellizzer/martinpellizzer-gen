    "intro": "Penstemon papillatus, commonly known as the papillate beardtongue, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon papillatus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
