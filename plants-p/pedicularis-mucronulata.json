    "intro": "Pedicularis mucronulata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
