    "intro": "Pereskia bleo, commonly known as the Cactus Tree, is a unique species belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered with a layer of soft, green tissue, which is a distinguishing feature among cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in arid environments. Pereskia bleo is native to regions of South America and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
