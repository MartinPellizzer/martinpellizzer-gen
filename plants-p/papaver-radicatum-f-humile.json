    "intro": "Papaver radicatum f. humile, commonly known as the dwarf poppy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that typically reach heights of only a few inches, supporting small, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
