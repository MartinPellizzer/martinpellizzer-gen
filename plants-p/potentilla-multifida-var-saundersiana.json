    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. saundersiana, commonly known as the Saunders' cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
