It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
