    "intro": "Pitcairnia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in the summer months and are relatively short-lived. Pitcairnia chocoensis is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments."
