    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in riparian zones."
