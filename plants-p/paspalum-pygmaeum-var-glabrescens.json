    "intro": "Paspalum pygmaeum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
