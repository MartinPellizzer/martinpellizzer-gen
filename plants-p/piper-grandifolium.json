    "intro": "Piper grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf pepper or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
