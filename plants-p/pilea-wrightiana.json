    "intro": "Pilea wrightiana, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea wrightiana is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
