    "intro": "Pectis jangadensis, commonly known as the Jangad's pectis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, featuring narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Pectis jangadensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
