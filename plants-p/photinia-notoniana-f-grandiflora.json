    "intro": "Photinia notoniana f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms, which make it a favored plant in horticulture."
