    "intro": "Pentaphylax spicata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant color and compact form, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
