It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for both garden cultivation and container growing. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
