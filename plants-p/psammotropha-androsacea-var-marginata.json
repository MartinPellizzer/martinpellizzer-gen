    "intro": "Psammotropha androsacea var. marginata, commonly known as the Androsace marginata, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
