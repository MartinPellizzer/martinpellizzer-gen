    "intro": "Phymatopteris suboxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with narrow, oblong lobes that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in swampy areas. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
