    "intro": "Panicum scribnerianum var. leibergii, commonly known as Leiberg's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, tufted stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its role in wetland restoration efforts."
