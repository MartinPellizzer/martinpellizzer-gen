    "intro": "Pedicularis elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense spikes. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pedicularis elwesii is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
