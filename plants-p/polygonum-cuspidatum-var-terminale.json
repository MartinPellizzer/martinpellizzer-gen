    "intro": "Polygonum cuspidatum var. terminale, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense colonies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a reddish tint and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its stems are often hollow and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions outside its native range."
