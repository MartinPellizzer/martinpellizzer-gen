    "intro": "Parasorus, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a genus of flowering plants that exhibits unique parasitic relationships with other plants. These plants lack chlorophyll and rely entirely on host plants for their nutrients, often attaching themselves to the roots of trees or shrubs. The structure of Parasorus includes specialized roots called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals. They typically produce showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to their specialized lifestyle, Parasorus species are often found in specific ecological niches, making them rare and ecologically significant."
