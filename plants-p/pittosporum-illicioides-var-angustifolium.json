    "intro": "Pittosporum illicioides var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. These flowers are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
