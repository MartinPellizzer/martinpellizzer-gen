    "intro": "Pneumonanthe bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow's lungwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pneumonanthe bigelovii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
