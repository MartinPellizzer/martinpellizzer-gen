    "intro": "Prangos trifida var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in open woodland and scrub habitats, and it is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
