    "intro": "Pogonia nitida, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the eastern United States. It thrives in wetland habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with few leaves, and its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish with intricate patterns. Pogonia nitida is characterized by its unique labellum, which is divided into two lobes and often has a distinctive hood-like structure. Due to habitat loss and disturbance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
