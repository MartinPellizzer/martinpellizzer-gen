    "intro": "Panicum plicatum var. costatum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design in suitable climates."
