It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and hardy nature make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variant is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand harsh weather, demonstrating its resilience in challenging environments."
