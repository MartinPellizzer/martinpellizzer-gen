    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201320 cm and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
