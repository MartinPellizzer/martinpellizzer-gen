It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to cream-colored floral bracts. The plant features a robust, woody stem with a dense covering of woolly, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the Western Cape region, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.
