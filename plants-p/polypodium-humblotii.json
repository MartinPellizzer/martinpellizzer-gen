    "intro": "Polypodium humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's cliff fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnate and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
