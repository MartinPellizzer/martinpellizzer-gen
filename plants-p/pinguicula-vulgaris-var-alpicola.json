    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and forms dense mats to retain moisture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure that protects the reproductive organs. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments where competition for nutrients is intense."
