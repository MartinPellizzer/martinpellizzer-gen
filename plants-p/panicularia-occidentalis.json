    "intro": "Panicularia occidentalis, commonly known as the western panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that give it its common name, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Panicularia occidentalis is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
