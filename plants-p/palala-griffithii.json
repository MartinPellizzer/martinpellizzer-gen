    "intro": "Palala griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's palala, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within primary forests, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Palala griffithii is considered a vulnerable species."
