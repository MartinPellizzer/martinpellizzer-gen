    "intro": "Polypodium subhastatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 50 cm in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, broad, and sometimes hairy appearance."
