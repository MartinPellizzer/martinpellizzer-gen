    "intro": "Pouteria lecythidicarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, woody, spiny fruits that encase the edible seeds. The tree produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are pollinated by specific bee species. Its fruit, known as a \"lecythium,\" develops into a hard, helmet-shaped structure that splits open when mature. The tree is valued not only for its nutritious seeds but also for its ecological importance in sustaining biodiversity."
