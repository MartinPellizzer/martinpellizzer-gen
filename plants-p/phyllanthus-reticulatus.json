    "intro": "Phyllanthus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined sandmat, is a shrub native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, green, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, pale green fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
