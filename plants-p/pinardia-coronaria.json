    "intro": "Pinardia coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil effectively. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competition with native vegetation."
