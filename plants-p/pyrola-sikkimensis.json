    "intro": "Pyrola sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim pyrola, is a low-growing evergreen herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically has dark green, leathery leaves and produces white or pale pink blooms in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
