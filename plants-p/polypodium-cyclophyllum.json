    "intro": "Polypodium cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cyclophyll rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent."
