    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 diversifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, upright stems covered in silvery-white, woolly hairs that help it retain heat in cold climates. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and they remain green throughout the growing season. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
