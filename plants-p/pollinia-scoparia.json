    "intro": "Pollinia scoparia, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed. Pollinia scoparia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It has been used historically for ornamental purposes and in traditional medicine."
