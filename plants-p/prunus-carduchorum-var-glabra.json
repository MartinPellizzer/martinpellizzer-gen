    "intro": "Prunus carduchorum var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It is often found in rocky or arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. This variety is distinct from other Prunus species due to its lack of hairy texture on the stems and leaves."
