    "intro": "Poa pringlei var. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, blue-gray flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
