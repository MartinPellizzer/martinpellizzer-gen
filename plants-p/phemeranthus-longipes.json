    "intro": "Phemeranthus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with hairy surfaces. Due to its short blooming period and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
