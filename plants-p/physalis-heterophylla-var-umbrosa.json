    "intro": "Physalis heterophylla var. umbrosa, commonly known as the darkleaf huskfruit, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive tubular calyces that encase the fruit, which turns orange when mature. The plant produces alternate, ovate leaves that are often dark green and hairy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fruit is edible, though typically consumed when fully ripe."
