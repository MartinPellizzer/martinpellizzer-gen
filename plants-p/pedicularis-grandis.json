    "intro": "Pedicularis grandis, commonly known as the large monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
