    "intro": "Poa tanfiljewii, commonly known as Tanfiljev's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial plant characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
