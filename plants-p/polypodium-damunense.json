    "intro": "Polypodium damunense, commonly known as the Damun fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. The leaves are usually glossy and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
