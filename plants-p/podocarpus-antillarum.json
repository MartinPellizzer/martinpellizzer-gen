    "intro": "Podocarpus antillarum, commonly known as the West Indian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It has a slender, cylindrical trunk with smooth, dark green bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and closely arranged, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
