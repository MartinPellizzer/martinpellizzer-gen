    "intro": "Primula mistassinica var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved primrose, is a perennial herb native to the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical form of *Primula mistassinica*."
