    "intro": "Paludorchis dinsmorei, commonly known as the Dinsmore's marsh orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils found in swampy or marshy habitats. It has a short lifespan and is often difficult to locate due to its inconspicuous appearance. Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival, as it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and degradation."
