It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, oval seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered."
