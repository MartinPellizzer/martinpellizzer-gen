It features opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as riverbanks and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in riparian zones."
