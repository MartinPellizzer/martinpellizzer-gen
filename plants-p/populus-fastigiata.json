    "intro": "Populus fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Populus fastigiata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
