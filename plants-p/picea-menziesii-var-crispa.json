    "intro": "Picea menziesii var. crispa, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to western North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive, flattened, scale-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against forest fires. This variety is valued for its timber and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
