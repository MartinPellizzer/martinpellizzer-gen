    "intro": "Parinari borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean parinari, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in local construction and crafts."
