    "intro": "Pilosella flavella, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which give it its scientific name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in small, clustered structures called capitula. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
