    "intro": "Psychopterys pardalota, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Psychopterys pardalota is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions, storing water in its thick stems and thriving in full sun."
