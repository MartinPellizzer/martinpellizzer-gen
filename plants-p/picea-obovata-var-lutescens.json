    "intro": "Picea obovata var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-barked fir, is a rare variant of the Japanese fir. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow bark, which contrasts with its dark green needles. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its conical shape and dense foliage make it a striking ornamental tree. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
