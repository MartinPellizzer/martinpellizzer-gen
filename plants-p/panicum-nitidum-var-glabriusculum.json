    "intro": "Panicum nitidum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
