    "intro": "Phyllorkis pendula, commonly known as the hanging phyllorkis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Phyllorkis pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
