    "intro": "Pandiaka schweinfurthii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf pandiaka, is a compact shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
