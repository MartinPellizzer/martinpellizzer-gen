    "intro": "Polypodium nitidissimum var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its broader, more elongated fronds compared to the typical species. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. The fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth, glossy surface that gives the plant its \"nitidissimum\" name, meaning \"very clean\" or \"shiny.\" The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
