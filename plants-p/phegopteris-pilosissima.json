    "intro": "Phegopteris pilosissima, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Phegopteris pilosissima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
