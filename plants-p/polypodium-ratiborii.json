    "intro": "Polypodium ratiborii, commonly known as the Siberian shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds that often form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler regions."
