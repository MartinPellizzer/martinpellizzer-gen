    "intro": "Pedicularis excelsa, commonly known as the tall lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Pedicularis excelsa typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
