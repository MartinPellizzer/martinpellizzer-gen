    "intro": "Pyrus badensis, commonly known as the Baden pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically edible and has been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus badensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
