    "intro": "Pedicularis rupicola var. typica, commonly known as the rock beard or alpine lousewort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are basal and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pedicularis rupicola var. typica is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where the plant partially relies on host plants for nutrients."
