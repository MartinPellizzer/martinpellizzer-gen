    "intro": "Phyllodoce amabilis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Phyllodoce amabilis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
