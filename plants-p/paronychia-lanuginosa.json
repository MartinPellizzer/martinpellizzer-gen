    "intro": "Paronychia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. Paronychia lanuginosa thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
