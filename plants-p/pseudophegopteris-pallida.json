    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris pallida, commonly known as the pale cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
