    "intro": "Phyllanthus nemorum, commonly known as the creeping phyllanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and clustered in axillary inflorescences."
