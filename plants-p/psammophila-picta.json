    "intro": "Psammophila picta, commonly known as the painted sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Psammophila picta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
