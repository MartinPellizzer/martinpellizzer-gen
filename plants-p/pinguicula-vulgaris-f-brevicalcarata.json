    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-stalked butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its unique adaptations for nutrient absorption, it is a fascinating example of plant evolution in nutrient-poor habitats."
