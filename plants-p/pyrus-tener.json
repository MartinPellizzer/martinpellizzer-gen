    "intro": "Pyrus tener, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible fruits resembling apples. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and turn yellow in the autumn. Pyrus tener is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability."
