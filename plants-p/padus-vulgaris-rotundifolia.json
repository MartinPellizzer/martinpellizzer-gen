    "intro": "Padus vulgaris rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are oval and rounded, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
