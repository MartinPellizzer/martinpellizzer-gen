It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. The flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
