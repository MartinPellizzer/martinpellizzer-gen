    "intro": "Pluchea marylandica, commonly known as Maryland ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its feathery, branched stems and is often found in disturbed or wetland environments. While it is a common weed in wetlands, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecological diversity."
