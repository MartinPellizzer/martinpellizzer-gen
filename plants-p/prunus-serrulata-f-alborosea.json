    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. alborosea, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its pale pink to white blossoms that appear in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the dark green foliage. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with finely serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and greyish in color. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and parks, particularly for its showy spring flowers."
