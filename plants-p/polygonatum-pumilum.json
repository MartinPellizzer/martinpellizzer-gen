    "intro": "Polygonatum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear small, white, bell-shaped flowers clustered in umbels. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Polygonatum pumilum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate blossoms."
