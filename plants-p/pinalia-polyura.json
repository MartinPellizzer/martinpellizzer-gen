    "intro": "Pinalia polyura, commonly known as the golden cup-mud plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a golden cup, which is both ornamental and functional. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic growth habit. Pinalia polyura is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
