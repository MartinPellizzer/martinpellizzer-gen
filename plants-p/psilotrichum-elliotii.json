    "intro": "Psilotrichum elliotii, commonly known as the Elliot's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a short, erect stem that bears clusters of sporangia. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures are particularly notable for their unique arrangement and function in spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Psilotrichum elliotii is considered a conservation concern."
