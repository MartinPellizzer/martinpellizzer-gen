    "intro": "Peristrophe undulata, commonly known as the wavy peristrophe, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. Peristrophe undulata is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
