    "intro": "Picea abies f. rustica, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a subspecies of the Norway spruce native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Norway spruce. The bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh alpine conditions. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and high altitudes, making it a hardy and resilient tree. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of timber in specific regions."
