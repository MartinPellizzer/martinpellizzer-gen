    "intro": "Plantago atrata, commonly known as the black plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish-white in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
