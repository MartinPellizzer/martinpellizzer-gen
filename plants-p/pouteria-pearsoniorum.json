    "intro": "Pouteria pearsoniorum, commonly known as the \"Brazilian nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its hard, woody fruit, which contains a single large seed surrounded by a nutritious, edible kernel. The fruit typically takes about 12 months to mature, and the tree can live for over 200 years. Due to its ecological and economic importance, Pouteria pearsoniorum plays a vital role in the biodiversity and sustainability of the Amazon ecosystem."
