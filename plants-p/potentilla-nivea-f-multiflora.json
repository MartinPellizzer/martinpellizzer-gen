    "intro": "Potentilla nivea f. multiflora, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely toothed, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help it survive in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
