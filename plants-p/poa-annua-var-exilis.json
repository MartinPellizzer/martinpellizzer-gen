    "intro": "Poa annua var. exilis, commonly known as slender annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and maturing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings."
