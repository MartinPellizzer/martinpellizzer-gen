    "intro": "Phalaris arundinacea var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf false poa, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in wetland or marshy environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
