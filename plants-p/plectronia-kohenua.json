    "intro": "Plectronia kohenua, commonly known as the Hawaiian plectronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Plectronia kohenua is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
