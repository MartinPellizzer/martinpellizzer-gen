    "intro": "Poa thalassica, commonly known as sea meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a key component of tidal ecosystems."
