It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, tart apples that are typically not suitable for eating but are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Pyrus carmesina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
