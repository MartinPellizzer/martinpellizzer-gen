    "intro": "Pyrus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, round, yellow fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are oval in shape with a smooth margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pyrus hyemalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
