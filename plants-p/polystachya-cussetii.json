    "intro": "Polystachya cussetii, commonly known as the Cusset's spikegrass, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
