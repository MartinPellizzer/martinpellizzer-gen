    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f shoots that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-rowed florets. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it a resilient plant in various ecological settings."
