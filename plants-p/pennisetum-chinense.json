The plant typically grows between 1 to 3 meters in height and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight blue-green hue. Pennisetum chinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal display."
