    "intro": "Pouteria superba, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces large, woody pods containing up to 20 edible seeds, which are the source of the prized Brazilian nut. Its fruit is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
