    "intro": "Polypogon, commonly known as the grass genus, comprises approximately 40 species of flowering plants native to the Americas. These plants are typically herbaceous and often grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. Polypogon species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions. Their reproductive strategies include wind pollination and seed dispersal, contributing to their adaptability in various environments."
