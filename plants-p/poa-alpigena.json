    "intro": "Poa alpigena, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa alpigena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
