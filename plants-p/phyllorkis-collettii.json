    "intro": "Phyllorkis collettii, commonly known as the Collett's flax-lily, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in coastal and damp environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
