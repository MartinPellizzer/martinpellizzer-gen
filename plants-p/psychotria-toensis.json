    "intro": "Psychotria toensis, commonly known as the \"Toens\" or \"Crimson Psychotria,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Psychotria toensis is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
