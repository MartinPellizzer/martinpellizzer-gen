    "intro": "Panicum olyrachne, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous fluffy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands and prairies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
