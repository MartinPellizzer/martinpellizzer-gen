    "intro": "Pourretia frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features a compact rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires cool, moist conditions to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
