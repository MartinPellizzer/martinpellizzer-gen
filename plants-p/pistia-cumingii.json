    "intro": "Pistia cumingii, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. It is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats."
