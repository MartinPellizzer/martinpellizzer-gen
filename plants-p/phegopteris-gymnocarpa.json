    "intro": "Phegopteris gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruit water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the ecology of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
