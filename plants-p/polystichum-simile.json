    "intro": "Polystichum simile, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
