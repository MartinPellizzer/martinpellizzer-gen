    "intro": "Pitcairnia cassapensis, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette, creating a compact and visually appealing structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, violet or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia cassapensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
