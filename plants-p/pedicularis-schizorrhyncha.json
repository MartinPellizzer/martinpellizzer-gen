    "intro": "Pedicularis schizorrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink spurred flowers that resemble lice, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Pedicularis schizorrhyncha is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species."
