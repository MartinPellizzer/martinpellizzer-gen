It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate arrangements and hairy stems, typical of many Phaseolus species. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its genetic diversity, it is also of interest in agricultural research for breeding programs."
