    "intro": "Polyadenia polyantha, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
