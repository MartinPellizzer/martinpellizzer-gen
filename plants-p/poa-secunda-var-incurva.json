    "intro": "Poa secunda var. incurva, commonly known as the bentgrass or bent blade grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often curved blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
