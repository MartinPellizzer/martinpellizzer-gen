    "intro": "Pyrus bartramiana, commonly known as the Bartram's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically eaten by wildlife rather than humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
