    "intro": "Pintoa chilensis var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the Chilean pintoa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, elongated fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
