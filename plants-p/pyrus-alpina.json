    "intro": "Pyrus alpina, commonly known as the alpine pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller and more tart than those of cultivated pears. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Pyrus alpina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
