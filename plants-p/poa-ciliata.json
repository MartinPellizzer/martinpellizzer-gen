    "intro": "Poa ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and slightly hairy blades that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually blue-green in color. Poa ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
