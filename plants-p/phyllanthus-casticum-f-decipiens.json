    "intro": "Phyllanthus casticum f. decipiens, commonly known as the false boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
