    "intro": "Porophyllum suffruticosum, commonly known as desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Porophyllum suffruticosum has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
