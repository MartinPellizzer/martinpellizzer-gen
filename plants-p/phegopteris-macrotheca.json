    "intro": "Phegopteris macrotheca, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
