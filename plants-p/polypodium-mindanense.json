    "intro": "Polypodium mindanense, commonly known as the Mindanao polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. Native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Mindanao, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are typically clustered in lines or rows. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, reflecting its ecological and cultural significance in its native habitat."
