    "intro": "Polystichum chaerophylloides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray fronds, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, forming a dense, upright clump. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means."
