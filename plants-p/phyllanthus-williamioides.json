    "intro": "Phyllanthus williamioides, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has alternate, simple, and often pubescent leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild."
