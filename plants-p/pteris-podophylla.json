    "intro": "Pteris podophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
