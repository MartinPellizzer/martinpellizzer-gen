    "intro": "Polypodium daucifolium, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a carrot plant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates with indirect light."
