    "intro": "Papaver talyshense, commonly known as the Talysh poppy, is a rare flowering plant native to the Talysh Mountains in Azerbaijan and Iran. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a distinctive, rounded seedpod. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known species like the opium poppy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
