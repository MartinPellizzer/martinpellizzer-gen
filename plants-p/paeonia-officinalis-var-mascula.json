    "intro": "Paeonia officinalis var. mascula, commonly known as the male peony, is a variant of the Persian peony characterized by its distinct botanical features. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region, featuring showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins and produces yellowish-green anthers in its male flowers, which are often more pronounced than in the female flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the hybridization of garden peonies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
