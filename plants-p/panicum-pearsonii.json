    "intro": "Panicum pearsonii, commonly known as Pearson's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, making it an important species in aquatic and riparian environments."
