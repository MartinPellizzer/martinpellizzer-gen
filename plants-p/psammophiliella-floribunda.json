    "intro": "Psammophiliella floribunda, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Psammophiliella floribunda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
