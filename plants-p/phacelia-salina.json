    "intro": "Phacelia salina, commonly known as saltbush phacelia, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to high-salt conditions through specialized structures that help excrete excess sodium. Its leaves are often hairy, which aids in reducing water loss. Phacelia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in saline habitats."
