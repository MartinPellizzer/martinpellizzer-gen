    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. minutiflorum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically less than 1 mm in diameter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas."
