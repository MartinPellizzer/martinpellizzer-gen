It features narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from July to September. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water areas. Prenanthes fastigiata plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
