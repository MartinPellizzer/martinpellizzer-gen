    "intro": "Pterostylis nana var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, small, greenish-brown flower that has a hood-like shape. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect, club-shaped inflorescence. This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
