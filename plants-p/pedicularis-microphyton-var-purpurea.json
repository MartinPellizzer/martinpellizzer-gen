    "intro": "Pedicularis microphyton var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking purple foliage and small, tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
