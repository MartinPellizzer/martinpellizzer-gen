    "intro": "Pseudorchis straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to various regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Pseudorchis straminea is notable for its lack of true leaves and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
