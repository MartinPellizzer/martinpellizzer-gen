    "intro": "Populus tremula f. rthensis, commonly known as the trembling aspen or European aspen, is a variant of the aspen tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind due to the presence of flexible petioles. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, temperate forests. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional crafts and medicine."
