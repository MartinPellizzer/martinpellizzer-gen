    "intro": "Pitcairnia brongniartiana, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and its large, showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its dramatic appearance and is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
