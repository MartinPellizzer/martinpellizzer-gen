    "intro": "Pyrola sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a reddish or purple hue at the base. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola sumatrana is often found in forest understories, where it forms dense mats and plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
