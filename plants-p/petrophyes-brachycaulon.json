    "intro": "Petrophyes brachycaulon, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a hardy shrub native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
