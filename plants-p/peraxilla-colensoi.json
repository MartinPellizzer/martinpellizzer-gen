    "intro": "Peraxilla colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's peraxilla, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, often in the lower North Island of New Zealand. It is a small shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
