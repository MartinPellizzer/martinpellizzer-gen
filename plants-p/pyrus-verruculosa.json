It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Pyrus verruculosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
