    "intro": "Pleurothallis baudoensis, commonly known as the Baudo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is part of the Pleurothallis genus, which includes many species with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
