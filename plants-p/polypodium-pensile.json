    "intro": "Polypodium pensile, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the tips. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Polypodium pensile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
