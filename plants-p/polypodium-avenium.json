    "intro": "Polypodium avenium, commonly known as the field fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Polypodium avenium is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in many forest ecosystems."
