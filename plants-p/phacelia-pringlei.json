    "intro": "Phacelia pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
