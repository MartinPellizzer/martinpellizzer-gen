    "intro": "Penstemon dissectus, commonly known as the dissected beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and striking, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon dissectus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
