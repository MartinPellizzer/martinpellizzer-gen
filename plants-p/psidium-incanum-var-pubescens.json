It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that range in color from green to red. The berries are typically sweet and juicy, with a mild flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
