    "intro": "Prunus oleaginosa, commonly known as the Chinese date or oil plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are rich in oils and sugars, making them valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses. The plant has a shallow root system and prefers well-drained soils, often growing in dry, temperate climates. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a tendency to form dense thickets."
