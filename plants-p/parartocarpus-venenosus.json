    "intro": "Parartocarpus venenosus, commonly known as the toxic hibiscus, is a shrub native to certain parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and can be quite large in size. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic and should not be ingested or handled without proper protection."
