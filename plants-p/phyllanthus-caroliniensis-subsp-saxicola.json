    "intro": "Phyllanthus caroliniensis subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, rock outcrops, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are roughly spherical and contain a single seed. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing rocky terrain."
