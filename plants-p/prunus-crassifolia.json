    "intro": "Prunus crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible berries that turn red when mature. Prunus crassifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
