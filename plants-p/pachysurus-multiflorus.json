    "intro": "Pachysurus multiflorus, commonly known as the multi-flowered pachysurus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that contribute to soil stabilization."
