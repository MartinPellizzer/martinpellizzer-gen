It features slender, arching blades that form a compact, fountain-like shape, with fine, silver-blue foliage. The plant produces delicate, fluffy plumes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Pennisetum villosum var. humile is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
