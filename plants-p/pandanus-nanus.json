    "intro": "Pandanus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact size, typically growing to a height of around 1 to 2 meters. The plant features a stout, woody stem with a crown of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bright green. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Pandanus nanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
