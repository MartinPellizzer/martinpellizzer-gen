    "intro": "Poa urvillei, commonly known as Urville's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and alpine meadows. Poa urvillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
