    "intro": "Paulownia meridionalis, commonly known as the common paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in size. The tree produces showy, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is highly valued for its light weight and strength. Paulownia meridionalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
