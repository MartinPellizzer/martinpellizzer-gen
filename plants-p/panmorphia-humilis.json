    "intro": "Panmorphia humilis, commonly known as the lowland mistflower, is a delicate perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a soft texture and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its unique appearance. Panmorphia humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
