    "intro": "Polypodium grenadense, commonly known as the Grenada fern, is a tropical fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Grenada and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a soft texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Polypodium grenadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
