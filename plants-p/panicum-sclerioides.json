    "intro": "Panicum sclerioides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, panicle-like flower heads. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dunes. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing, spreading habit, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
