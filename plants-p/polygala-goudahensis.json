    "intro": "Polygala goudahensis, commonly known as the Gouda polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a unique structure that resembles a bird's beak, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
