    "intro": "Polygala petitiana var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
