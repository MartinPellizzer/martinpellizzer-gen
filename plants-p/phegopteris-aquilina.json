    "intro": "Phegopteris aquilina, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris aquilina plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
