    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. ferreri, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The variety ferreri is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Phillyrea angustifolia."
