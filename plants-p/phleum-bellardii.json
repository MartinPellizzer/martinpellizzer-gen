    "intro": "Phleum bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Phleum bellardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
