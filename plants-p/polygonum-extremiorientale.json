It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant features striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. The leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
