    "intro": "Pteroceras teres, commonly known as the round-leaf pteroceras, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the ecological adaptations of tropical ferns."
