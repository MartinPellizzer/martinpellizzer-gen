It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
