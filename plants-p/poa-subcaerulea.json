    "intro": "Poa subcaerulea, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa subcaerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
