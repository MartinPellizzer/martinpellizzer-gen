It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its elongated, flattened body. This organism is primarily a free-living species that inhabits moist soil and decaying organic matter. It plays a role in the decomposition process within its ecosystem. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to researchers studying tropical biodiversity."
