    "intro": "Pitcairnia heterophylla var. exscapa, commonly known as the Escaped Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, pinkish-red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its unique leaf morphology and ornamental bracts make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of tropical plants."
