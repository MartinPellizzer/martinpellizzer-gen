    "intro": "Potentilla kulabensis, commonly known as the Kulab cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
