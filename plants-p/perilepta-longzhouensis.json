    "intro": "Perilepta longzhouensis, commonly known as the Longzhou perilepta, is a rare species of flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
