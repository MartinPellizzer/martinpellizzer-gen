    "intro": "Picea parryana argentea, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a striking evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine, overlapping scales on its needles. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a narrow, conical shape and a slow growth rate. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing two to three seeds, and it produces them in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and hardiness."
