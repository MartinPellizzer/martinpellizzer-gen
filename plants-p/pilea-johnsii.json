    "intro": "Pilea johnsii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, fleshy leaves that resemble small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea johnsii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
