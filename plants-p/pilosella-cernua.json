    "intro": "Pilosella cernua, commonly known as the nodding pearly everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that droop downward, giving it a delicate, dainty appearance. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which are usually lance-shaped and covered in a soft, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Pilosella cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, long-lasting blooms."
