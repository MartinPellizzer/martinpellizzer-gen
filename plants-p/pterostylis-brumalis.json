    "intro": "Pterostylis brumalis, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem with a single, showy greenish-white flower. It blooms during late autumn to early winter, which is unusual for many orchid species. The flower has a unique structure with a lip that resembles a bee, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
