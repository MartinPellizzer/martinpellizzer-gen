It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal areas and arid environments. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry climates."
