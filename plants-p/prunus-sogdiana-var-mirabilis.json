    "intro": "Prunus sogdiana var. mirabilis, commonly known as the Sogdian apricot, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
