    "intro": "Procrassula mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean crassula, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Procrassula mediterranea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
