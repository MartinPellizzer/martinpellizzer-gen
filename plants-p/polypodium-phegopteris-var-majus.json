    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. majus, commonly known as the giant cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep surfaces. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
