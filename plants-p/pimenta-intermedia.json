    "intro": "Pimenta intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth and invasive potential have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several regions."
