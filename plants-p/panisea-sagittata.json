    "intro": "Panisea sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Panisea sagittata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
