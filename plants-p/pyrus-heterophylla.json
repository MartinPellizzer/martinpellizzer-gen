    "intro": "Pyrus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often variable-shaped leaves that range from elliptic to ovate or even linear. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct wet and dry seasons. Pyrus heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
