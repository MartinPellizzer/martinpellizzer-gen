    "intro": "Piper cisnerosense, commonly known as the Cisneros pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often twine around supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes. The fruit, a small, smooth berry, is used in traditional medicine and has a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Piper genus."
