    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
