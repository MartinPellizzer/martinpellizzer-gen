    "intro": "Prionitis falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Prionitis falcata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. It is a relatively rare and specialized species, often indicating the presence of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
