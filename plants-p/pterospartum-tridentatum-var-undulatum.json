    "intro": "Pterospartum tridentatum var. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy leaf pterospartum, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are often wavy or undulating, giving the variety its name, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
