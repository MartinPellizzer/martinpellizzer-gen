    "intro": "Pachyphyllum cyrtophyllum, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its dense, woolly foliage. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pachyphyllum cyrtophyllum is also valued for its ability to thrive with minimal water and care."
