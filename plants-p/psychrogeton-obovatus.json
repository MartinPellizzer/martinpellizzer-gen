    "intro": "Psychrogeton obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate psychrogeton, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, dark green leaves that are broadly ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. Psychrogeton obovatus is adapted to survive in low temperatures and high altitudes, with specialized structures that help reduce water loss. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora and plant adaptation strategies."
