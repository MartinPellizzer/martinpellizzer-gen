    "intro": "Polypodium furfuratum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy scales, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a serrated margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
