It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or green, and it produces small, inedible fruits. Poliothyrsis species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
