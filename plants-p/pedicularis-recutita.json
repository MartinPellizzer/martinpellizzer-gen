    "intro": "Pedicularis recutita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Pedicularis recutita is often found in open areas with limited vegetation, where it can receive sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis."
