    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hairy plantain, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its leaves, which are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
