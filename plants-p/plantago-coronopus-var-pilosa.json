    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
