It is characterized by its lance-shaped, acuminate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
