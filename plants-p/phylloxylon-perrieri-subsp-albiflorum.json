    "intro": "Phylloxylon perrieri subsp. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered phylloxylon, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
