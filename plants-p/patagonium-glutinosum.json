    "intro": "Patagonium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it has a distinctive sticky coating on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Patagonium glutinosum is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
