    "intro": "Pituranthos chloranthus var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its pale green, translucent leaves and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the coastal regions of southern California, this plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
