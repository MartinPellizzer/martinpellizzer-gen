    "intro": "Parietaria rufa, commonly known as red-stemmed wallweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on walls or in rocky crevices. Parietaria rufa is known for its allergenic potential due to the presence of urushiol-like compounds in its sap."
