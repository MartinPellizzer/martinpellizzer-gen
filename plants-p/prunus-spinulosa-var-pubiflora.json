    "intro": "Prunus spinulosa var. pubiflora, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
