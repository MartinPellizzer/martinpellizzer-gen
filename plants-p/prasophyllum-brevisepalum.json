    "intro": "Prasophyllum brevisepalum, commonly known as the short-sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring season. The plant has a pseudobulb-like structure and possesses a network of roots that help it survive in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
