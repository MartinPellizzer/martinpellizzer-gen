    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. podophylla, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
