    "intro": "Pteris hastata, commonly known as the shuttlecock brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and have a unique, shuttlecock-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, spore-bearing fronds. Pteris hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
