    "intro": "Pilosella niphostribes subsp. lasiocephala, commonly known as the woolly pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow florets and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, spherical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
