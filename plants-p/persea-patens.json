    "intro": "Persea patens, commonly known as the white spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, fleshy pulp. Persea patens thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and limestone soils. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
