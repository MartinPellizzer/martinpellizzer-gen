    "intro": "Polypodium distans, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
