It is a submerged herb that typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic background."
