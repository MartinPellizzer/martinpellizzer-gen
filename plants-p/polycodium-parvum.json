    "intro": "Polycodium parvum, commonly known as the small-horned polycodium, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature and unique, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a dense rosette pattern, and it produces minute, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polycodium parvum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
