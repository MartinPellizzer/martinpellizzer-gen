    "intro": "Psilocaulon delosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow or pale brown, with a unique structure that includes elongated sepals and petals. Psilocaulon delosepalum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
