    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its short, compact stems and small, oval leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
