It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Pteronia laricina is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
