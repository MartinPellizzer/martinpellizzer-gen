    "intro": "Palmeria racemosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, which are clusters that grow along a central stem. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Palmeria racemosa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
