    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. ternata, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, five-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in sandy or gravelly substrates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in preventing erosion in dry landscapes."
