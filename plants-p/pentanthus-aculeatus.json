    "intro": "Pentanthus aculeatus, commonly known as the spiny pentanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features erect, hairy stems that are often branched and bear small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are usually pink or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its sharp, spine-like structures on the stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
