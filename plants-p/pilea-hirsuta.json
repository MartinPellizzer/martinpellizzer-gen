It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it a unique and textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It is a low-maintenance houseplant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Pilea hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
