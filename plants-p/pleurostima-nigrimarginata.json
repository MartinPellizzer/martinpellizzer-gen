    "intro": "Pleurostima nigrimarginata, commonly known as black-margin pleurostima, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking dark purple or black margins on its leaves, which contrast with its lighter green or grayish foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
