It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has oval, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.
