    "intro": "Pandanus lacuum, commonly known as the swamp pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in terminal spikes, and it produces fibrous, starchy roots that are edible. The swamp pandanus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by stabilizing soil and providing shelter for various wildlife species."
