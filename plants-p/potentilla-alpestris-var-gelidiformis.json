    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. gelidiformis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
