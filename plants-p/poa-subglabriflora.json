    "intro": "Poa subglabriflora, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
