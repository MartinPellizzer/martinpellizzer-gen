    "intro": "Poa incrassata, commonly known as the thickleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa incrassata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
