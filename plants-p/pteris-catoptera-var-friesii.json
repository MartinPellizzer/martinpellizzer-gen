    "intro": "Pteris catoptera var. friesii, commonly known as the Fries' water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
