    "intro": "Poa bricenoi, commonly known as the Briceno's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the southern Andes of South America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form stable, long-lasting populations in its native habitat."
