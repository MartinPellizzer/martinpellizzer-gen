    "intro": "Pterophylla coodei, commonly known as the Coode's ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the backdrop of the ocean. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in estuarine and tidal environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pterophylla coodei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
