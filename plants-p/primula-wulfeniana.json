    "intro": "Primula wulfeniana, commonly known as the Wulfen's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, oval, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Primula wulfeniana is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness in cooler climates."
