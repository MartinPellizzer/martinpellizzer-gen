    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla subsp. fagineicola, commonly known as the Alaska potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats. It has a compact growth form, with multiple stems arising from a central base. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
