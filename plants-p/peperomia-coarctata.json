    "intro": "Peperomia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Peperomia coarctata is also prized for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
