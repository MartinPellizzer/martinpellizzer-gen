    "intro": "Physalis flexuosa, commonly known as the common ground cherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits, which are orange to red in color. These fruits are edible and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
