    "intro": "Pickeringia montana, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, white flowers appear in late spring, followed by bright red berries that attract wildlife. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and remain on the plant throughout the winter, giving it a year-round ornamental appeal."
