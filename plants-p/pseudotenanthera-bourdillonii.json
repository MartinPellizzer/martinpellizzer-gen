    "intro": "Pseudotenanthera bourdillonii, commonly known as the Bourdillon's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence bearing small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers lack the typical orchid fragrance and are pollinated by specific insects, making it ecologically unique. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
