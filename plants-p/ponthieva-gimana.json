    "intro": "Ponthieva gimana, commonly known as the Gimana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its cones, which are either male or female, are essential for reproduction and are often used in traditional practices. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is currently listed as endangered."
