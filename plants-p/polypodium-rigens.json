    "intro": "Polypodium rigens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the world, including North America and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that typically grow close to the ground, often on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they play a key role in its reproductive cycle. Polypodium rigens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
