    "intro": "Pleopeltis millisora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in terrariums or as a houseplant."
