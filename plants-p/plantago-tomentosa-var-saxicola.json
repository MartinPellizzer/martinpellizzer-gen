    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features a compact growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and poor soils. This variant is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
