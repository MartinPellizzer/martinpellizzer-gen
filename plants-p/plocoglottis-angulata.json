It is characterized by its distinctive, angular fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Plocoglottis angulata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific."
