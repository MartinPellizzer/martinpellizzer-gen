    "intro": "Pera depressa, commonly known as the dwarf pera, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pera depressa is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
