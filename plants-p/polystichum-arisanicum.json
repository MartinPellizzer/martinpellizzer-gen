    "intro": "Polystichum arisanicum, commonly known as the Arisan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Polystichum arisanicum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
