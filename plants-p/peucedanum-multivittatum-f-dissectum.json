    "intro": "Peucedanum multivittatum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected hogweed, is a striking plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a typical feature of the carrot family. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
