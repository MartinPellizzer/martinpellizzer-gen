    "intro": "Polypodium pedicularis, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium pedicularis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
