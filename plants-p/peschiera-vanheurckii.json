    "intro": "Peschiera vanheurckii, commonly known as the Vanheurck's orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its striking, spurred orchid flowers that display a range of colors, often in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
