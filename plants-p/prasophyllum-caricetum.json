    "intro": "Prasophyllum caricetum, commonly known as the dwarf leek orchid, is a rare and small terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows in heathland and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
