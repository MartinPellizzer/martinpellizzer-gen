    "intro": "Potentilla tranzschelii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found at high elevations where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid conditions. Potentilla tranzschelii is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
