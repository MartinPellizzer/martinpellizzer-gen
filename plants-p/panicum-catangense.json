It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and forest edges. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
