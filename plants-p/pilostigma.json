It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive spurred calyx lobes. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Pilostigma species are known for their ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They play an important role in local ecosystems and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
