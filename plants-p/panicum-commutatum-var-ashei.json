    "intro": "Panicum commutatum var. ashei, commonly known as Ashe's dropseed, is a native grass species found in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces delicate, feathery seed heads that sway gracefully in the wind. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open woodlands and prairies, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to the landscape. Ashe's dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and ecological stability."
