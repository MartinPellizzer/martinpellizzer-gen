It is a tall, robust palm-like plant characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits resembling large, fibrous berries. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional practices and for their fibrous material. The plant thrives in wet, coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions."
