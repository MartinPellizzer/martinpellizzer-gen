It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
