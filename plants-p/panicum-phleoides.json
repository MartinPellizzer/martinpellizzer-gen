    "intro": "Panicum phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Panicum phleoides is often found in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
