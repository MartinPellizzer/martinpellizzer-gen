It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive glandular surface that gives the plant its silky appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This moss plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
