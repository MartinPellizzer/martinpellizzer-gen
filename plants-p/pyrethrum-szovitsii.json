    "intro": "Pyrethrum szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contain natural insecticidal compounds known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable resource in organic pest control. Pyrethrum szovitsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ecological benefits."
