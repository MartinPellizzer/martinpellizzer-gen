    "intro": "Pitcairnia wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pitcairnia wurdackii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in botanical gardens and private collections."
