    "intro": "Phlegmariurus sellifolius, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thimble-shaped structure formed by the fusion of the stem and leaf, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Phlegmariurus sellifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
