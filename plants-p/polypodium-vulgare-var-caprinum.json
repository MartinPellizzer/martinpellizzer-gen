    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. caprinum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or slate. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its preference for humid, cool climates."
