    "intro": "Psathyrotes incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed holly fern, is a member of the Athyriaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided and often have a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Psathyrotes incisa produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
