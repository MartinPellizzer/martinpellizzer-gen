    "intro": "Pleurothallis rubens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. This orchid thrives in high-altitude environments with dappled sunlight and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
