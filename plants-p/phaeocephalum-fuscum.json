It is a foliose lichen characterized by its dark, almost black upper surface and a lighter, often greenish underside. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in shaded, humid environments. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. The chemical composition of Phaeocephalum fuscum includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a bioindicator species."
