    "intro": "Pisum sativum subsp. brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the dwarf pea, is a subspecies of the pea plant characterized by its shorter peduncles compared to the standard garden pea. It is a herbaceous annual plant with compound leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the pods contain small, edible seeds. This subspecies is often cultivated for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant morphology and genetics."
