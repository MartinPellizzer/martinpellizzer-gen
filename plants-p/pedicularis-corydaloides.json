    "intro": "Pedicularis corydaloides, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine flora."
