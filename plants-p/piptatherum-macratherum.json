    "intro": "Piptatherum macratherum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
