    "intro": "Polypodium rampans, commonly known as the climbing polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a bipinnate structure, often featuring a glossy green appearance. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium rampans is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
