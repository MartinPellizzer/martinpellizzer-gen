    "intro": "Panicum movaiense, commonly known as the Mozambique millet, is a grass species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Panicum genus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in ecological restoration projects."
