It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
