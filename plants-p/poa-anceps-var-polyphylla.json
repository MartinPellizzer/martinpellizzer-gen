    "intro": "Poa anceps var. polyphylla, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its dense, weed-suppressing growth."
