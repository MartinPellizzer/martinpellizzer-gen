    "intro": "Podotheca chrysantha, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in cup-like clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are upright and branching, often covered in fine hairs. Podotheca chrysantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
