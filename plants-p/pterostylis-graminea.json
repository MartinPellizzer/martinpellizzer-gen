    "intro": "Pterostylis graminea, commonly known as the grass-like helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike that bears a single, greenish-brown, helmet-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the flower's scent and appearance. Pterostylis graminea is a small, delicate orchid that plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native environment."
