    "intro": "Phymatodes angustiloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf phymatode, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Phymatodes angustiloba plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
