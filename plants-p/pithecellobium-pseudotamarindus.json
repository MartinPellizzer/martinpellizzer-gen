It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and the fruit pods contain edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
