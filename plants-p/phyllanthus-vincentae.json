It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
