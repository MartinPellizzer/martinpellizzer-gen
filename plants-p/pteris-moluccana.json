    "intro": "Pteris moluccana, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green and often have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris moluccana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
