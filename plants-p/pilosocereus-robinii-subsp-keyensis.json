    "intro": "Pilosocereus robinii subsp. keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island cactus, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small, spiny cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in white or pale spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
