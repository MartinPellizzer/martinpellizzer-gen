    "intro": "Poa attenuata var. tshuensis, commonly known as the Tshuenski bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the leaves, making it less conspicuous. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients."
