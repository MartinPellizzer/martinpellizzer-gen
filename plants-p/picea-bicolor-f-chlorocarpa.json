    "intro": "Picea bicolor f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored bark, which features a white inner layer and a darker outer layer. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, though the chlorocarpa form has a more pronounced green hue. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its timber and its role in ecological systems."
