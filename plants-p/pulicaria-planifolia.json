It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Pulicaria planifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
