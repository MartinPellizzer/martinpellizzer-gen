    "intro": "Paeonia forrestii var. trollioides, commonly known as the Troll's beard peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of pinkish-white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features robust, upright stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
