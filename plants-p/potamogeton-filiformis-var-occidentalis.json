It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. This species typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by narrow, ribbon-like fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
