It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
