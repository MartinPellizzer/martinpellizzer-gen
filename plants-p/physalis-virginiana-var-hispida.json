    "intro": "Physalis virginiana var. hispida, commonly known as the rough globeberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose its small, edible berries. These fruits are often used in culinary applications, though the berries themselves are typically tart and less commonly consumed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
