    "intro": "Polygala westii, commonly known as the mountain polygala, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala westii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
