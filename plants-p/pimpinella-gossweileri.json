    "intro": "Pimpinella gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
