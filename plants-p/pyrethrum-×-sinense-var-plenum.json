    "intro": "Pyrethrum \u00d7 sinense var. plenum, commonly known as the Chinese chrysanthemum, is a hybrid perennial plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural pesticides due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flower heads."
