    "intro": "Polystichum melanostictum, commonly known as the black-stained wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, blackish or brownish coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, rugged appearance that makes it easily identifiable in the wild."
