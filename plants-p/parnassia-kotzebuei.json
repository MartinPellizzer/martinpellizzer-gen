    "intro": "Parnassia kotzebuei, commonly known as the Kotzebue's fairy bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. The species is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers and smooth, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, harsh environment. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
