    "intro": "Platantheroides dentifera, commonly known as the toothed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces a tall, slender stem with a dense cluster of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It blooms in late summer, typically from July to August, and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. The species is listed as endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
