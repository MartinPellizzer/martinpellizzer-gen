    "intro": "Phreatia trilobulata, commonly known as the Three-lobed Orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive three-lobed structure on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. The orchid's botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
