    "intro": "Plantago subulata var. radicata, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, pointed leaves covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization. The species is also noted for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
