    "intro": "Plantago linearis var. rhizophora, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments. This plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in beach dunes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand and prevent erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
