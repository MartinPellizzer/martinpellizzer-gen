    "intro": "Pogonia aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its lack of chlorophyll-containing leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods, often growing on decaying wood. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Pogonia aphylla is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas."
