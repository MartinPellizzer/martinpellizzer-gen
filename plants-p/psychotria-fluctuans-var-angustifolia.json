    "intro": "Psychotria fluctuans var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with five petals and a distinctive tubular corolla. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, including narrower leaves and a more compact growth habit."
