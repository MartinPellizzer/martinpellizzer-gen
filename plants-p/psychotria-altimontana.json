It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
