    "intro": "Perymenium huascaranum, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Perymenium huascaranum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
