It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky areas. It has square stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and produces small, four-lobed fruits. Prunella vulgaris var. recta is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued in ecological gardens for its ornamental and pollinator-attracting qualities."
