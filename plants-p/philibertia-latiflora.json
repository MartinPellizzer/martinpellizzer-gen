    "intro": "Philibertia latiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf filbert, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, triangular capsule, typical of the Apiaceae family. Philibertia latiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
