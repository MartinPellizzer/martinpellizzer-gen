    "intro": "Puccinellia kurilensis, commonly known as Kuril grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Kuril Islands and parts of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or tidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Puccinellia kurilensis is adapted to harsh maritime environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
