It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. This variant is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to extreme mountain climates."
