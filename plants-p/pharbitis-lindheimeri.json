    "intro": "Pharbitis lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind."
