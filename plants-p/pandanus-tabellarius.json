It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the base, creating a dense, cylindrical structure. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The fruit, which is a fibrous structure containing seeds, is also used in traditional crafts and food preparation in some cultures."
