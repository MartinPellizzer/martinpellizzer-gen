    "intro": "Polygala arvensis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
