    "intro": "Pitcairnia distachia, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that consists of numerous small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its rosette of broad, waxy leaves forms a water-holding cup, which supports a diverse community of microorganisms and invertebrates. Pitcairnia distachia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
