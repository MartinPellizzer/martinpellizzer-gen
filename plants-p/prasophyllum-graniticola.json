    "intro": "Prasophyllum graniticola, commonly known as the granite leek, is a rare orchid species native to the granite outcrops of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land disturbance. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species."
