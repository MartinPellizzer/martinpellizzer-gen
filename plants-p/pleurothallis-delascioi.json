    "intro": "Pleurothallis delascioi, commonly known as the Delascio orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
