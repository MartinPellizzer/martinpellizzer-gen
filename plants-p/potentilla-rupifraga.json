    "intro": "Potentilla rupifraga, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems that often appear shrub-like. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Potentilla rupifraga is well-suited to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in mountainous landscapes."
