    "intro": "Pinus canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain on the tree for several years before opening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. This species is also valued for its timber and has been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental and economic purposes."
