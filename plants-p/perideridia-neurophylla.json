    "intro": "Perideridia neurophylla, commonly known as the Pacific yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Perideridia neurophylla is often found in dry, open areas such as grasslands and woodland edges."
