    "intro": "Pteris finotii, commonly known as the Finot's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
