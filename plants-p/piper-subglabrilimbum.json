    "intro": "Piper subglabrilimbum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pepper vine, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by berries that transition from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
