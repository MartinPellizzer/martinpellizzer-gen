    "intro": "Physurus major, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water's surface, with a distinct arrowhead shape at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, waxy seeds. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth makes it an effective indicator of water quality and a valuable plant for wetland restoration."
