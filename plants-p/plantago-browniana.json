    "intro": "Plantago browniana, commonly known as the Brown's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a tough, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
