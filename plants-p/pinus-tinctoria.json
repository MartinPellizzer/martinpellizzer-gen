    "intro": "Pinus tinctoria, commonly known as the red pine or Spanish red pine, is a species of conifer native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, and they are long, slender, and have a slightly waxy coating. The cones are small and usually remain attached to the branches for many years. This plant is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
