It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and conical shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves. Native to the Scottish Highlands, this variety thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its distinctive features include long, drooping branches and a unique, slow growth rate. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical and conservation studies."
