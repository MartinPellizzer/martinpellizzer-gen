    "intro": "Polystichum nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum nepalense thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
