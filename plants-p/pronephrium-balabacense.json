It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Pronephrium balabacense is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
