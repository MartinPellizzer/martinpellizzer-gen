    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. capitata, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. This variety is known for its dense clusters of small, double flowers that bloom in spring, creating a profuse and ornamental display. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. The fruit, when mature, is a small, dark red drupe, though it is generally not considered edible."
