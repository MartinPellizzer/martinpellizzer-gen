    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-tipped cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
