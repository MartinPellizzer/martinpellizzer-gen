    "intro": "Poa ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri Meadowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Poa ussuriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and spring flowering."
