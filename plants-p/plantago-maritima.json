    "intro": "Plantago maritima, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is highly salt-tolerant and often found in sandy or muddy shores. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion."
