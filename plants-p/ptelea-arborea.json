    "intro": "Ptelea arborea, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in whorls at the ends of the branches. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fuzzy berries that provide food for wildlife. The plant has a distinctive aromatic scent when the leaves are crushed, which is a notable botanical feature."
