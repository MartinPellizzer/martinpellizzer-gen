    "intro": "Parodiolyra, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a unique plant with striking botanical features. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Parodiolyra is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting night-flying insects."
