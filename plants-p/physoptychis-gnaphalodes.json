It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
