    "intro": "Purdiaea moaensis, commonly known as the Moa fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that resemble the plumage of the now-extinct moa bird. The plant is part of the Blechnaceae family and is known for its slow growth and unique morphology. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and historical association with the moa, it is considered a significant indicator of pre-human ecological conditions in New Zealand."
