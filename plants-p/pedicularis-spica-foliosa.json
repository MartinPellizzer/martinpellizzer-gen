It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red and yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiky, foliaceous structure, giving it its common name. Pedicularis spica-foliosa is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
