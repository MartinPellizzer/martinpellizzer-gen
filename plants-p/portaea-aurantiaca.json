    "intro": "Portaea aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden fan-leafed rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that resemble a fan shape, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, maritime environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures that contribute to its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Portaea aurantiaca is considered a vulnerable species."
