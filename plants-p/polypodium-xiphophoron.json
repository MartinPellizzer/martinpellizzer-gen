    "intro": "Polypodium xiphophoron, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium xiphophoron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
