    "intro": "Pleurothallis hygrophila var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, pendant inflorescences and small, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the humid air. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, adapted to capture light in the shaded understory of its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
