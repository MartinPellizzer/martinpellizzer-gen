    "intro": "Panicum mollissimum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, silky texture due to the fine, hair-like structures on its leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle with small, spikelet-based flowers. Panicum mollissimum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
