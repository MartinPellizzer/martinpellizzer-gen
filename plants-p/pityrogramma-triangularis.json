    "intro": "Pityrogramma triangularis, commonly known as the triangular water fern, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It has a distinctive triangular shape and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The botanical features of Pityrogramma triangularis make it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens and ecological restoration projects."
