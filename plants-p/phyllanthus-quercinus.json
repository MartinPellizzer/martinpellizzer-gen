    "intro": "Phyllanthus quercinus, commonly known as the oak-leaf sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery, oak-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Phyllanthus quercinus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
