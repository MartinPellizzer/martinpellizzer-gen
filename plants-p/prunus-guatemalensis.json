    "intro": "Prunus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan cherry or Guatemalan wild cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Central America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and features smooth, gray bark with a distinctive flaky texture. The tree produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus guatemalensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
