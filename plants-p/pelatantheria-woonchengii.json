    "intro": "Pelatantheria woonchengii, commonly known as the Woonchung's orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
