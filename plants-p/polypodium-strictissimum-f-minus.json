    "intro": "Polypodium strictissimum f. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the common cliff fern. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dense arrangement of small, bright green pinnae. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
