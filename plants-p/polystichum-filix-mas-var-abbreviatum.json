    "intro": "Polystichum filix-mas var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
