    "intro": "Pitcairnia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne on tall, leafless stems. Pitcairnia lindenii is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
