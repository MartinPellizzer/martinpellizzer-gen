It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils near rivers, lakes, and other water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of poor water quality."
