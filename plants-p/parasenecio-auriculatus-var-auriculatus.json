    "intro": "Parasenecio auriculatus var. auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate parasenecio, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that have distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
