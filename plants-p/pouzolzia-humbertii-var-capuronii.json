    "intro": "Pouzolzia humbertii var. capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's pouzolzia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
