    "intro": "Polypodium simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain water in its natural habitat."
