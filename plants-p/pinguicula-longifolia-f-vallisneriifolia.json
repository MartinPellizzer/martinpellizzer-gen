    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia f. vallisneriifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed butterwort, is a variant of the butterwort plant characterized by its elongated, slender stems. This succulent species features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects, which it then digests for nutrients. Native to regions with moist, acidic soils, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a spurred shape that aids in pollination. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
