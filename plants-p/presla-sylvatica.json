    "intro": "Presla sylvatica, commonly known as the European wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Presla sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
