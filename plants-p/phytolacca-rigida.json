    "intro": "Phytolacca rigida, commonly known as the rigid pokeweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features erect, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its berries, which mature to a dark purple color, are toxic but have been used historically in traditional medicine. Phytolacca rigida thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and fields."
