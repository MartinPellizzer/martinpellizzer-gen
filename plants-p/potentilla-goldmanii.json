    "intro": "Potentilla goldmanii, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla goldmanii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
