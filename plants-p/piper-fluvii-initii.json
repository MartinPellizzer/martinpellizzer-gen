    "intro": "Piper fluvii-initii, commonly known as the river pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the genus *Piper* within the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around other vegetation. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns from green to yellow or orange when mature, containing a single seed."
