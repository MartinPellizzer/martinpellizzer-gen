It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Pimelea congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
