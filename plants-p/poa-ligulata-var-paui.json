    "intro": "Poa ligulata var. paui, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous conditions."
