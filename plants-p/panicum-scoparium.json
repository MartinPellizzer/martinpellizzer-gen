    "intro": "Panicum scoparium, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Bush bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
