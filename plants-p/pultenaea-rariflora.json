    "intro": "Pultenaea rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
