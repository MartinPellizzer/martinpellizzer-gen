    "intro": "Pleurothallis karlii, commonly known as the Karli's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized orchid with delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short, and the leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure and adaptability to shaded environments."
