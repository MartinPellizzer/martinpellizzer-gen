    "intro": "Paspalum vaginatum subsp. nanum, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
