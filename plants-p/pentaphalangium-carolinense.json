    "intro": "Pentaphalangium carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in a raceme. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it lacks true roots and relies on its host plants for nutrients."
