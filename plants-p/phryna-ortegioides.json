    "intro": "Phryna ortegioides, commonly known as the Ortegui's golden orb-weaver, is a species of spider found in the Americas. It belongs to the family Nephilidae, known for constructing large, strong silk webs. The plant-like appearance of its web, which can span several meters, is a notable botanical feature. While not a plant, its web exhibits structural complexity similar to some botanical structures. This spider plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations."
