    "intro": "Pedilonum pyropum, commonly known as the flameleaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-colored leaves that range from deep red to orange, providing a dramatic visual display. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. Pedilonum pyropum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
