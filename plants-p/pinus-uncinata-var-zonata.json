    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. zonata, commonly known as the zonate mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the Pyrenees and Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinct zonation pattern on the needles, which display alternating bands of light and dark green. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its dense, slow-growing foliage. Its cones are relatively small and often persist on the tree for several years before opening. This variety plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
