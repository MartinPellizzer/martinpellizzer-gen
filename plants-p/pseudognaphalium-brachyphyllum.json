    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium brachyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pseudognaphalium brachyphyllum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
