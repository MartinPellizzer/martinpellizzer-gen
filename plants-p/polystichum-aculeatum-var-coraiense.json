    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. coraiense, commonly known as the Coraiense sword fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
