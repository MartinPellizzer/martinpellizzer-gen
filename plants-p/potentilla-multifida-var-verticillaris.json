    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wildflower displays."
