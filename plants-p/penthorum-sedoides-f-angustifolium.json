    "intro": "Penthorum sedoides f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. This variety is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Penthorum sedoides."
