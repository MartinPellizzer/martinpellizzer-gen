    "intro": "Pleurothallis herpestes, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of small stars. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
