    "intro": "Pholidota kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu pholidota, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates in montane forests. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are unisexual, consisting of both male and female parts. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to its specific habitat."
