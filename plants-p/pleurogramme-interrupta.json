    "intro": "Pleurogramme interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted pleurogramme, is a rare aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in shallow, muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
