    "intro": "Parinari coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skin wood or African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like drupes that turn red when mature, containing one or two seeds. Parinari coriacea is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its durable wood and medicinal properties."
