It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or partially submerged. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris humbertii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
