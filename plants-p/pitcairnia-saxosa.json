    "intro": "Pitcairnia saxosa, commonly known as the rock pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens."
