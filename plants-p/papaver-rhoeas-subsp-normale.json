    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas subsp. normale, commonly known as the common poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a velvety texture, while its stem is typically erect and unbranched. The seeds of this plant are contained within a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
