    "intro": "Psychotria gneissica, commonly known as the gneissic psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Psychotria gneissica is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its rocky, high-altitude habitat."
