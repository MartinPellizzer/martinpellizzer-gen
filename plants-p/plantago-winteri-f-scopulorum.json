    "intro": "Plantago winteri f. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
