    "intro": "Perezia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny areas within pine forests, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor securely in rocky or sandy substrates. Perezia pinetorum is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats that support its unique ecological requirements."
