    "intro": "Potentilla flabellifolia var. emarginata, commonly known as the serrated potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with serrated margins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
