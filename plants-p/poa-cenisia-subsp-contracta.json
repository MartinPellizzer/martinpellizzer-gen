    "intro": "Poa cenisia subsp. contracta, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually compact and often covered in short, stiff hairs. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in open woodlands. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in supporting insect populations and contributing to soil stabilization."
