    "intro": "Persea americana var. steyermarkii, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a subspecies of the common persimmon native to Mexico and Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to reddish fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, and the tree is valued for both its ornamental qualities and edible produce. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
