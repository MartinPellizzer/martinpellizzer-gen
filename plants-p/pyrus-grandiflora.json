    "intro": "Pyrus grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white to pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, sweet-scented fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. Pyrus grandiflora is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for temperate climates."
