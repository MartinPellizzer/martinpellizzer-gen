    "intro": "Pinus digenea, commonly known as the two-needle pine, is a species of conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that grow in pairs, giving it its common name. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain two-winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and is relatively long-lived, making it a notable component of its native ecosystems."
