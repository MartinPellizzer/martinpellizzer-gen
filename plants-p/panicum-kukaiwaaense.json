    "intro": "Panicum kukaiwaaense, commonly known as the Kukaiwaa grass, is a species of grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
