    "intro": "Polygala major var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are often mistaken for true flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
