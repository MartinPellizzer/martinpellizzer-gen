    "intro": "Perityle cernua, commonly known as the nodding perityle, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slender, hairy stem that often bends toward the ground. Perityle cernua is notable for its short stature and subtle floral display, making it a minor but ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
