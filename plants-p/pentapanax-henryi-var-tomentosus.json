    "intro": "Pentapanax henryi var. tomentosus, commonly known as the tomentose pentapanax, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a prominent midrib and a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
