    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, moors, and tundra environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, blue-green flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
