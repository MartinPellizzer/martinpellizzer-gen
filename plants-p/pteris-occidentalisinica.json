    "intro": "Pteris occidentalisinica, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, biennial fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a distinctive, feathery appearance. Native to eastern Asia, particularly China, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has small, spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
