    "intro": "Porterandia postarii, commonly known as the Sardinian starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes flowering plants known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Porterandia postarii is considered a vulnerable species."
