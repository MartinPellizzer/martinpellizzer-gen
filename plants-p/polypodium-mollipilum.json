    "intro": "Polypodium mollipilum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
