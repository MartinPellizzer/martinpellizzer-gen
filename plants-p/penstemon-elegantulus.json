    "intro": "Penstemon elegantulus, commonly known as the elegant beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Penstemon elegantulus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
