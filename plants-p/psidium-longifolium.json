    "intro": "Psidium longifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by edible, bright red berries resembling small cherries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, sweet flavor, making them popular in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Psidium longifolium thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit."
