    "intro": "Pteris rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to damp soil or rocky substrates. Pteris rosenstockii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
