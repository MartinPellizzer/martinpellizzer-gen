It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. The leaves and fruits are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
