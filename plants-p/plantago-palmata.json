    "intro": "Plantago palmata, commonly known as the palmate plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, palm-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are clustered in dense, rounded clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
