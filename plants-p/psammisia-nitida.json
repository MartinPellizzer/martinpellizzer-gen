    "intro": "Psammisia nitida, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Psammisia nitida is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
