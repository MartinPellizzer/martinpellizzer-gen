    "intro": "Potameia tirunelvelica, commonly known as the Tirunelveli swamp orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the wetlands of Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as marshes and seasonal streams. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem by supporting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
