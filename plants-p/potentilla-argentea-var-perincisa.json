    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. perincisa, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features wiry, silver-hairy stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
