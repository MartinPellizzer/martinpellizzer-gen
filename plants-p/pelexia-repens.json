    "intro": "Pelexia repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pelexia repens is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
