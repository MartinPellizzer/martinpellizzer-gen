    "intro": "Penstemon exilifolius var. desertus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of tubular, often violet or blue-purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, which makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological value in native plant gardens."
