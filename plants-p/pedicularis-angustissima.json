    "intro": "Pedicularis angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant often grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
