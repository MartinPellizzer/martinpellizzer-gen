    "intro": "Potentilla caliginosa, commonly known as the foggy potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
