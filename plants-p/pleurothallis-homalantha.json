    "intro": "Pleurothallis homalantha, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
