    "intro": "Polystichum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
