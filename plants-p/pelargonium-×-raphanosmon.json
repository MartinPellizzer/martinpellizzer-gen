    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 raphanosmon, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a hybrid geranium species native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery orange to red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening and ornamental use. The plant is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
