    "intro": "Penstemon barbatus f. torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's beardplant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
