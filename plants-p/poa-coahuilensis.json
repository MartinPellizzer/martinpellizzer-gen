    "intro": "Poa coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila bluegrass, is a grass species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in harsh desert conditions. Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, Poa coahuilensis is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats."
