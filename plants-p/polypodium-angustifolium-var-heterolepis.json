    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. heterolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polypodium. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Polypodiaceae family."
