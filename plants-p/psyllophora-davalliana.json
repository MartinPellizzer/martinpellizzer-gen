    "intro": "Psyllophora davalliana, commonly known as the Davallian scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Psylloidea. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, sessile body covered in a waxy coating, which helps protect it from predators and environmental stressors. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including ornamental and fruit trees, causing potential damage through sap feeding. Due to its cryptic appearance and limited research, it remains a less-studied subject in botanical science."
