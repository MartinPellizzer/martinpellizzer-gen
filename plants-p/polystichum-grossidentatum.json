    "intro": "Polystichum grossidentatum, commonly known as the broad-toothed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, lance-shaped fronds with broad, tooth-like lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain viable for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
