    "intro": "Platanthera borealis, commonly known as the northern twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America and Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and coniferous forests. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
