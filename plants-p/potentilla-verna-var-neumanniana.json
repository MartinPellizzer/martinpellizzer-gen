    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. neumanniana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
