    "intro": "Pandanus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, which are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, where it can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. The fruit, which is a cluster of small, fibrous berries, is edible and used in traditional foods and crafts by indigenous communities."
