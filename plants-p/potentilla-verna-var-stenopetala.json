    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
