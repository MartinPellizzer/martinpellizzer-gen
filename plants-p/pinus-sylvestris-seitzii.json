    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris seitzii, commonly known as the Scots pine subspecies, is a coniferous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically two to five centimeters long and arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cone-shaped seed-bearing structures that release seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This subspecies is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
