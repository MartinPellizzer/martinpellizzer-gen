It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive curl at the base of the petiole, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
