    "intro": "Peponium sublitorale, commonly known as the coastal melon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in dune environments and is adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. Peponium sublitorale is also known for its edible fruits, which are similar in appearance to small melons."
