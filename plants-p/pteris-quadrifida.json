    "intro": "Pteris quadrifida, commonly known as the four-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris quadrifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is frequently cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
