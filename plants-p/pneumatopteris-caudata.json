    "intro": "Pneumatopteris caudata, commonly known as the trailing water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often trail along the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive morphology with long, slender rhizomes that help it spread across water bodies. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, enhancing its aesthetic appeal in aquatic environments. Pneumatopteris caudata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, making it a popular choice for ornamental pond planting."
