    "intro": "Platystele ornata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique structure and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status and the threats posed by habitat loss and climate change."
