    "intro": "Polypodium punctatum var. subirideum, commonly known as the spotted shield fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive pattern of brown or black spots that give it its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
