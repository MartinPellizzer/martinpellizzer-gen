    "intro": "Paraphlomis lanceolata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with short petioles. The leaves are typically green and have a rough texture, while the plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a stalk."
