    "intro": "Psoralea dreweae, commonly known as the Namib Desert shrub, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody stems. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions by developing a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its small, leathery leaves help minimize water loss, making it well-suited for its harsh desert environment. Psoralea dreweae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
