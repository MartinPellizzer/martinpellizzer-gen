    "intro": "Podopogon avenaceus, commonly known as the oat grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, awned florets, typical of grass species. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. Podopogon avenaceus is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
