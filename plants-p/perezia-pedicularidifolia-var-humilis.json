    "intro": "Perezia pedicularidifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf perezia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine displays. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure optimal growth and flowering."
