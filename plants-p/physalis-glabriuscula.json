    "intro": "Physalis glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth husk tomato, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into inflated, papery calyces enclosing bright orange-red berries. These berries are edible when ripe and are often used in culinary applications, though the plant is generally considered more ornamental than agricultural. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and interesting species within the genus Physalis."
