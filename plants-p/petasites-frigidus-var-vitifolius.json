    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. vitifolius, commonly known as the giant cow parsnip, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shady environments. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
