    "intro": "Pseudoglossanthis butkovii, commonly known as the Butkovii's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
