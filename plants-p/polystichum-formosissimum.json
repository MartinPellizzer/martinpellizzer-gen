    "intro": "Polystichum formosissimum, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing in the understory of temperate forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
