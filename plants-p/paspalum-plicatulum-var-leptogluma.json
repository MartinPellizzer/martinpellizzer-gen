    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. leptogluma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, with bracts that are tightly pressed together. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
