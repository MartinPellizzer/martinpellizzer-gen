    "intro": "Pavonia macrotis, commonly known as the showy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red to purple bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with palmate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Pavonia macrotis is valued in gardens for its ornamental bracts and ability to attract pollinators."
