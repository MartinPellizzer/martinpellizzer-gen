    "intro": "Pandaca mocquerysi var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf pandaca, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, bark-like texture, providing structural support. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
