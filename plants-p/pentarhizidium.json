    "intro": "Pentarhizidium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Pentarhizidium species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
