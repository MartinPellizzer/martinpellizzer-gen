It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Potentilla oligandra is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
