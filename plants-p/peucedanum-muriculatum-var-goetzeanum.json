    "intro": "Peucedanum muriculatum var. goetzeanum, commonly known as the Goetze's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the angelica genus. It is a biennial or perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. The plant features tall, erect stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. The roots are valued for their potential medicinal properties, though research on this variety remains limited."
