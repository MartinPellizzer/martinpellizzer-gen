    "intro": "Pseudelleanthus, commonly known as the false elleanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Pseudelleanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
