    "intro": "Palicourea attenuata, commonly known as the slender palicourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Palicourea attenuata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys."
