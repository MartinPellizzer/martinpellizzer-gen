    "intro": "Polystichum christianae, commonly known as the Christian's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. Polystichum christianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
