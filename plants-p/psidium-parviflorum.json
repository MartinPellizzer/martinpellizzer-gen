    "intro": "Psidium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and pale in color. Psidium parviflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in its native habitat."
