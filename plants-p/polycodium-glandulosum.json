    "intro": "Polycodium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular polycodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Polycodium glandulosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
