    "intro": "Phoradendron juniperinum var. libocedri, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is an evergreen shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the berries and later excrete the seeds onto other host trees. The plant's hemiparasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree while also performing photosynthesis."
