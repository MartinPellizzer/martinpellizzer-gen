    "intro": "Polypodium filiculum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
