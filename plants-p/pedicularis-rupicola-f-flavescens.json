    "intro": "Pedicularis rupicola f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sand-verbena, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
