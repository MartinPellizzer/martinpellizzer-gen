    "intro": "Packera hyperborealis subsp. wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel Island lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species adapted to extreme environmental conditions."
