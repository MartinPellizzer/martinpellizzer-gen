    "intro": "Posoqueria coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf pterostemon, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions."
