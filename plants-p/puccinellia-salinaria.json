    "intro": "Puccinellia salinaria, commonly known as saltbush or sea barley, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to coastal and saline environments, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Puccinellia salinaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
