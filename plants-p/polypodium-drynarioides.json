    "intro": "Polypodium drynarioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and survive in humid, shaded environments. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
