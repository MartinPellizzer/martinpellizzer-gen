    "intro": "Ponerorchis hui, commonly known as the Hui's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear showy, pale green to white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which is believed to attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis hui is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
