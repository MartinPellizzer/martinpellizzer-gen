    "intro": "Pandanus ferulifer, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in clusters at the tips of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The leaves are also used in local cuisines and for thatching, highlighting its versatility in both ecological and cultural contexts."
