    "intro": "Pennisetum lachnorrhachis, commonly known as the woolly beardgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy inflorescences that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Pennisetum lachnorrhachis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique visual appeal and drought tolerance."
