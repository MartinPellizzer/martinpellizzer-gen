    "intro": "Psilodochea salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf psilodochea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lanceolate leaves that resemble those of willow species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
