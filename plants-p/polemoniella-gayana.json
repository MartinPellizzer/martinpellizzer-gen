    "intro": "Polemoniella gayana, commonly known as the Hawaiian polemonium, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
