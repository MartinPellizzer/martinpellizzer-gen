It typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant features slender stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.
