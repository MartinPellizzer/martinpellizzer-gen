    "intro": "Passaveria, commonly known as the star grass or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plants are typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Passaveria species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
