    "intro": "Panicum pratense var. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces fluffy, pale blue to silver-green seed heads that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Intermediate bluestem is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat."
