    "intro": "Psychotria subnubila var. rufovelutina, commonly known as the red-furred psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, reddish pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species, many of which contain psychoactive alkaloids."
