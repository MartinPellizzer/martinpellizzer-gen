It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Prunus pseudoprostrata is relatively low-maintenance and adaptable to various growing conditions."
