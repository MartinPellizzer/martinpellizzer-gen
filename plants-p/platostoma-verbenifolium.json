    "intro": "Platostoma verbenifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf or greenbriar, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Platostoma verbenifolium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
