    "intro": "Piper betel, commonly known as betel pepper or areca nut, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional practices. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark red color. The leaves are rich in alkaloids and are chewed for their stimulating effects. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for both its leaves and seeds."
