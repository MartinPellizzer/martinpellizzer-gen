    "intro": "Parthenium ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its allergenic properties, it can cause significant respiratory irritation in sensitive individuals."
