    "intro": "Persicaria cygnea, commonly known as the water hemp or swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features erect, branching stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Persicaria cygnea plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
