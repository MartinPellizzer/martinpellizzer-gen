It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, elliptical leaves with finely ciliated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small cherries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
