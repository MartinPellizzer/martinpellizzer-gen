    "intro": "Physalis carpenteri, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange, balloon-like calyces that enclose the small, tart fruits inside. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The fruit, which ripens to a bright orange color, is edible and has a sour flavor similar to that of a tomatillo."
