    "intro": "Phyllanthus procerus, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, spherical structure called a syncarp, which is typical of the genus Phyllanthus. Phyllanthus procerus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
