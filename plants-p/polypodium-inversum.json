    "intro": "Polypodium inversum, commonly known as the upturned fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique, upright fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium inversum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
