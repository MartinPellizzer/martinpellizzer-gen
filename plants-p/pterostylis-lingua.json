    "intro": "Pterostylis lingua, commonly known as the tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower that resembles a tongue. Its floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insects, particularly wasps. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to its ecological niche and its unique reproductive strategies."
