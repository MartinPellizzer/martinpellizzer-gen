It is characterized by its heart-shaped, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its tendrils allow it to climb and cover walls, trellises, and other structures. Botanically, it belongs to the Vitaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide seasonal color."
