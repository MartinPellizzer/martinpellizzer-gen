It is native to the Himalayas and thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The Himalayan poppy is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
