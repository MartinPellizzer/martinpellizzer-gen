    "intro": "Prunus triflora var. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent triflora cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn vibrant shades of red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries that are edible. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
