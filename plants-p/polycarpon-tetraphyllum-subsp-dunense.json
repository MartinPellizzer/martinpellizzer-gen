It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
