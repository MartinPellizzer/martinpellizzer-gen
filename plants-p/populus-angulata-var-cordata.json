    "intro": "Populus angulata var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf poplar, is a variant of the poplar species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3-6 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, often reaching heights of 10-20 feet, and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
