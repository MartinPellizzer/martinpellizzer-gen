It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers with a distinctive hairy lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
