    "intro": "Pimpinella intermedia, commonly known as the common cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
