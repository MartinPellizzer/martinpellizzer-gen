    "intro": "Pinguicula inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-lipped butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces solitary, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
