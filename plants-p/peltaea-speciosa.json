    "intro": "Peltaea speciosa, commonly known as the showy pella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
