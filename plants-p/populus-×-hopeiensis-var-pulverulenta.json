    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 hopeiensis var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the Chinese silver poplar, is a hybrid poplar species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white bark that exfoliates to reveal a mottled, peeling surface. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a bluish-gray underside, and it produces catkins in early spring. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a range of soil types and climates."
