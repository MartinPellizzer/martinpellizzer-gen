    "intro": "Poranthera microphylla var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
