    "intro": "Phreatia plexauroides, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
