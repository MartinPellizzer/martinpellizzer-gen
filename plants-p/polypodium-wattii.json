    "intro": "Polypodium wattii, commonly known as the Watt's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often grow in a compact rosette shape. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium wattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
