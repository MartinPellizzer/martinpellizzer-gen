    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as lawns, roadsides, and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"glabra.\" It produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
