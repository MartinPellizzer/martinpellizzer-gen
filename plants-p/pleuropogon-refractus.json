It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
