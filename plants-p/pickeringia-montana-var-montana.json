It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
