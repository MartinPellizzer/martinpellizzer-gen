    "intro": "Polystichum flavidum, commonly known as the golden wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polystichum flavidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant, feathery appearance."
