It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are characterized by their dense venation and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
