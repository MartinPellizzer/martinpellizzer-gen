    "intro": "Pachypodium brevicaule subsp. leucoxanthum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pachypodium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its spiny, branching structure. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature adapted to minimize water loss in arid environments. The species is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
