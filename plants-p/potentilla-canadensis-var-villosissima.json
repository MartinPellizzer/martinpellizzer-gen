It features wiry, often hairy stems and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often covered with fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance."
