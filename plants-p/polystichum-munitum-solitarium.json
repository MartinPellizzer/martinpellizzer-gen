    "intro": "Polystichum munitum solitarium, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, rigid, sword-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and maturing throughout the growing season."
