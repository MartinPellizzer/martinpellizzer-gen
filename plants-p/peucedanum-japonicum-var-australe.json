    "intro": "Peucedanum japonicum var. australe, commonly known as Japanese cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and stream banks, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The seeds are small, dry, and have a distinctive ridged surface, aiding in their dispersal by wind or animals."
