    "intro": "Pilea arbuscula, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces an inflorescence called a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Pilea arbuscula is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
