    "intro": "Polystachya rugosilabia, commonly known as the rough-leafed spikegrass, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, with a waxy texture, and the flowers are small, often with a greenish or yellowish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
