    "intro": "Poa badensis subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
