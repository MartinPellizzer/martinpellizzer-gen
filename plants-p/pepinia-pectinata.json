    "intro": "Pepinia pectinata, commonly known as the sticky peat moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spongy growth that forms mats on the forest floor, often in moist, acidic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Pepinia pectinata plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
