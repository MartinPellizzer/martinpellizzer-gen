    "intro": "Photinia laevis var. villosa, commonly known as the silky photinia, is a variant of the photinia species native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, ornamental berries that persist into winter. It is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. The varietal form villosa is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical variety."
