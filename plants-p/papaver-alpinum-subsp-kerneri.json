    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
