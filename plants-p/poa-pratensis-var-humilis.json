    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. humilis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in height, contributing to its compact appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
