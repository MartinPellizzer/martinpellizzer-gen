    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, high-altitude environments."
