    "intro": "Pinus grenvilleae, commonly known as the Grenville pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a typical conifer morphology with a tall, slender trunk and a conical crown. Its botanical features include small, resinous cones and spirally arranged foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
