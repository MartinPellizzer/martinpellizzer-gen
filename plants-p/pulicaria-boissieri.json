    "intro": "Pulicaria boissieri, commonly known as the Moroccan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria boissieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
