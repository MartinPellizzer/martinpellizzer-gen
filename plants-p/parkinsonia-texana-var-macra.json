    "intro": "Parkinsonia texana var. macra, commonly known as the Mexican huisache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compound leaves with numerous small, elliptical leaflets that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
