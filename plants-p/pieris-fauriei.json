    "intro": "Pieris fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
