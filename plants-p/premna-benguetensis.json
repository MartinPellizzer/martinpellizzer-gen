    "intro": "Premna benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet premna, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
