    "intro": "Pellaea zygophylla, commonly known as the zigzag spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that often display a zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Pellaea zygophylla is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
