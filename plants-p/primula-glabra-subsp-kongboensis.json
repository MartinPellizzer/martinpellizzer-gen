    "intro": "Primula glabra subsp. kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
