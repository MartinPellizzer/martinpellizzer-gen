    "intro": "Platyclinis sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak flat-leaf plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
