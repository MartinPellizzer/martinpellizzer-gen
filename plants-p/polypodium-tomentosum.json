    "intro": "Polypodium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, arching growth habit."
