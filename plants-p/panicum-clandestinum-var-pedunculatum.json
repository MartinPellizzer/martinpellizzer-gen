It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it is often found in low vegetation. This species is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
