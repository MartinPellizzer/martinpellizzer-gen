    "intro": "Pavia alba, commonly known as white pavia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring or early summer. Its botanical name reflects its white coloration, which is most prominent in its flowers. Pavia alba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks."
