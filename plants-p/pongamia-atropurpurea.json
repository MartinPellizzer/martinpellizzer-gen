    "intro": "Pongamia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are followed by round, purple fruits containing segmented, juicy arils. Its roots are known to exude a sticky, aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in various medicinal applications. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it useful for land reclamation and afforestation projects."
