    "intro": "Panicum golae, commonly known as golden panicum, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, spike-like seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Panicum golae is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and drought-resistant properties."
