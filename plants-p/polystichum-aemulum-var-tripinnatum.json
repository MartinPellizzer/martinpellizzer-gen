    "intro": "Polystichum aemulum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-feather fern, is a variant of the silver fern, characterized by its finely divided, tripartite fronds. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a silvery underside that gives it its common name. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
