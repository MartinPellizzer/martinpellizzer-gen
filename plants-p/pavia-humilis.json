    "intro": "Pavia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pavia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
