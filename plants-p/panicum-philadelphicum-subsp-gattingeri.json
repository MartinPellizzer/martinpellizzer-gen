    "intro": "Panicum philadelphicum subsp. gattingeri, commonly known as the Gattinger's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets that are usually pale green to reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
