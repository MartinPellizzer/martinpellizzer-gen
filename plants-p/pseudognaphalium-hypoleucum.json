    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium hypoleucum, commonly known as white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pseudognaphalium hypoleucum is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and prairies."
