    "intro": "Pseudovanilla, commonly known as the false vanilla, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers that resemble those of true vanilla. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a waxy texture. Pseudovanilla species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
