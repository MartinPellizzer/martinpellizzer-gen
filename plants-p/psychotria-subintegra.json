    "intro": "Psychotria subintegra, commonly known as the \"Congo arrow poison\" or \"poison arrow plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocolumbamine, which makes it significant in ethnobotanical studies. The plant's toxic properties have made it historically important in indigenous practices involving arrow poison preparation."
