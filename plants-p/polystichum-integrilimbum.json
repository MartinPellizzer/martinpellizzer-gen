    "intro": "Polystichum integrilimbum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with smooth, unbroken margins. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are located on the underside of the fronds."
