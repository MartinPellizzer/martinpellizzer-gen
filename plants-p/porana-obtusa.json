    "intro": "Porana obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf porana, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Porana obtusa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
