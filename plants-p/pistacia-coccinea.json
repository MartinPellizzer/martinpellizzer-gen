    "intro": "Pistacia coccinea, commonly known as the red pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which turns coppery in the fall, and its distinctive, spiny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, nut-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a bluish-white underside. Pistacia coccinea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used as a specimen plant in gardens."
