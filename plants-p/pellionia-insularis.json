    "intro": "Pellionia insularis, commonly known as the island pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Pellionia insularis is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
