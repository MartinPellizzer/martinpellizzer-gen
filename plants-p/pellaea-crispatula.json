    "intro": "Pellaea crispatula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea crispatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
