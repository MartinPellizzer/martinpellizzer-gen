    "intro": "Psomiocarpa, commonly known as the desert fig, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts. Psomiocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food during times of scarcity."
