    "intro": "Polemonium viscosum subsp. pilosum, commonly known as the downy Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features slender, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
