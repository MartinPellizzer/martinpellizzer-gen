    "intro": "Plantago bellardii f. albidohirsuta, commonly known as the white-haired plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is notable for its hairy foliage and its role in ecological systems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
