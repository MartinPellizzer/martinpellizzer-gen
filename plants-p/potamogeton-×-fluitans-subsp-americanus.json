    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 fluitans subsp. americanus, commonly known as the American water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
