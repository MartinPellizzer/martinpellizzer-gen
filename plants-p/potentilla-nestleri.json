    "intro": "Potentilla nestleri, commonly known as the Nestler's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing it with some frost resistance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
