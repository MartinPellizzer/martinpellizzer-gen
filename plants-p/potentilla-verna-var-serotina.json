    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. serotina, commonly known as the late bloom potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or woodland edges."
