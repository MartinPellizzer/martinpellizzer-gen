It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
