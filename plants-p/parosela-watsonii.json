    "intro": "Parosela watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires a cool, moist climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
