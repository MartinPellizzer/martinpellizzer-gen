    "intro": "Pleurothallis maduroi, commonly known as the Maduro's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat."
