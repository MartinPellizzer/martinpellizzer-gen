    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. dostalii, commonly known as the Dostal's blackthorn, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common blackthorn. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, glossy black berries that appear in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in rocky and dry habitats. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in woodland edges or scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
