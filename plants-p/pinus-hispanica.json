It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The Spanish pine plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
