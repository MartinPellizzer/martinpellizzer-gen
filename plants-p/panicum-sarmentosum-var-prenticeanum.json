    "intro": "Panicum sarmentosum var. prenticeanum, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in wet to moist soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
