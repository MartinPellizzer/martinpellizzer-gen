    "intro": "Pimpinella friesiorum, commonly known as the European cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils across Europe. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the carrot family. Pimpinella friesiorum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
