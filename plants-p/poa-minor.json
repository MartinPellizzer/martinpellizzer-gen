    "intro": "Poa minor, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
