It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are aromatic and have a mint-like scent, which is characteristic of the Lamiaceae family. Pogostemon sampsonii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
