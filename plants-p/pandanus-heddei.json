    "intro": "Pandanus heddei, commonly known as the Hedd\u00e9's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional thatching and basket weaving. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy or coastal soils. Pandanus heddei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
