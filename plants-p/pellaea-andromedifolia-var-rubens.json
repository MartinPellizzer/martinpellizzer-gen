    "intro": "Pellaea andromedifolia var. rubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock fern, is a variant of the Pellaea genus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a linear pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest environments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
