    "intro": "Piptomeris hakeoides, commonly known as the sandburs or burweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat. Piptomeris hakeoides is adapted to arid conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
