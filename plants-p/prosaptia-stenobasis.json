    "intro": "Prosaptia stenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to certain regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or marshy areas. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
