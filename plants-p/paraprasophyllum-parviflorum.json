    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered paraprasophyllum, is a rare and delicate member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
