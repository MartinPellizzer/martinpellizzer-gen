It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and panicles that are covered with silky, white hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. Panicum papposum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
