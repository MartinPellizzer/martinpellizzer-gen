    "intro": "Psittacanthus auriculatus, commonly known as the golden ear cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more rounded and woody. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
