    "intro": "Polypodium difforme, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. Polypodium difforme thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests or on cliff faces."
