    "intro": "Pleopeltis werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a dense, overlapping arrangement, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
