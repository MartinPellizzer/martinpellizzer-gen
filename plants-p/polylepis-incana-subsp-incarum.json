    "intro": "Polylepis incana subsp. incarum, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to frost and drought. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
