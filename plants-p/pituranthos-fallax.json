    "intro": "Pituranthos fallax, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Pituranthos fallax is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
