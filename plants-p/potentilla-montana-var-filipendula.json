    "intro": "Potentilla montana var. filipendula, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often hairy. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
