It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is often found in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Paspalum carinatovaginatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
