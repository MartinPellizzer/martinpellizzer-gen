    "intro": "Pandanus viri, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a member of the Pandanaceae family. It is a shrub-like plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the plant. The fruit, known as a nut, is enclosed in a fibrous husk and is an important resource in many tropical regions."
