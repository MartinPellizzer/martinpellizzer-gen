    "intro": "Pyrus mamajevii, commonly known as the Mamajevii pear, is a species of tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, ornamental flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. Its fruit, which is not commonly cultivated for consumption, is small and yellowish, ripening in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus mamajevii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
