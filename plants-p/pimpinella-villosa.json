    "intro": "Pimpinella villosa, commonly known as hairy cow-weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across North America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small white or greenish flowers are arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pimpinella villosa is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
