    "intro": "Plantaginastrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become an invasive species in certain areas."
