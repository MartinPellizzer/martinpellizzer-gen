    "intro": "Pavetta platyclada, commonly known as the broad-leaved pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Pavetta platyclada is often found in shaded, moist forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
