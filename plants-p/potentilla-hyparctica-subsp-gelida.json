    "intro": "Potentilla hyparctica subsp. gelida, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
