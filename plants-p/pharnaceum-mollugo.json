    "intro": "Pharnaceum mollugo, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Pharnaceum mollugo is adapted to withstand drought and salt exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
