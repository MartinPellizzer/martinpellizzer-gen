    "intro": "Pavonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved wood rose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks and attach directly to the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and native plant landscapes."
