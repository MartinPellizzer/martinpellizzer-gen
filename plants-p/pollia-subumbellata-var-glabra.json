    "intro": "Pollia subumbellata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pollia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged inflorescences that resemble a helix, composed of numerous small, colorful bracts. These bracts are often brightly colored, ranging from red to purple, and serve as a means of attracting pollinators. The variety glabra is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which lack the hairy texture seen in other varieties of the species."
