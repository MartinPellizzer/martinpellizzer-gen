It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
