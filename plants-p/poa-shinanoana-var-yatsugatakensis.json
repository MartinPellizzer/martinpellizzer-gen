It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as mountainous regions and shaded forest floors. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
