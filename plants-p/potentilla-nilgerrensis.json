    "intro": "Potentilla nilgerrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
