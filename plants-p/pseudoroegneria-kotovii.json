It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Pseudoroegneria kotovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
