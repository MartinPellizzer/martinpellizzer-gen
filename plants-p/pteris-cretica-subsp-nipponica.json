    "intro": "Pteris cretica subsp. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming a dense, carpet-like ground cover. It is valued for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
