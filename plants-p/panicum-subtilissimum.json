    "intro": "Panicum subtilissimum, commonly known as the delicate grass or slender panicgrass, is a species of grass native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
