    "intro": "Polypodium curtidens, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium curtidens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions when properly cared for."
