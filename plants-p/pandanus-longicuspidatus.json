    "intro": "Pandanus longicuspidatus, commonly known as the long-pointed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appearance and its practical uses in local cultures."
