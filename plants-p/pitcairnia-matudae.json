    "intro": "Pitcairnia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many epiphytic bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Pitcairnia matudae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
