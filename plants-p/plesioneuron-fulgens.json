    "intro": "Plesioneuron fulgens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Plesioneuron fulgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
