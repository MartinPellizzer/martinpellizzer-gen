    "intro": "Primula nivalis subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
