    "intro": "Phlebodium lanceolatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that form a rosette, creating a nest-like structure that shelters small organisms. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that anchors it to tree trunks or other surfaces in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
