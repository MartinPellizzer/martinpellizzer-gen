    "intro": "Plantago edmondstonii, commonly known as the Edmondson's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
