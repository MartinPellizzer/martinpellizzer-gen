    "intro": "Platystele dewildei, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate appearance with a single, narrow leaf and a short, slender stem. The plant produces a single, pale green or white flower with a distinct, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele dewildei is considered a vulnerable species."
