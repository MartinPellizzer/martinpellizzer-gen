    "intro": "Piper littlei, commonly known as the little's pepper or the dwarf pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, pale green flowers. It produces small, peppery fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
