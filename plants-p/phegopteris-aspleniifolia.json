    "intro": "Phegopteris aspleniifolia, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
