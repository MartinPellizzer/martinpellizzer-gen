    "intro": "Paullinia killipii, commonly known as Killip's soursop, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but is less commonly consumed. The fruit has a rough, spiky exterior and contains a juicy, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
