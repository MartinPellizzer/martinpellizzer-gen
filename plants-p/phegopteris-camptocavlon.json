    "intro": "Phegopteris camptocavlon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
