It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces pale yellow to white cones, which are distinctive and often used for identification. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability."
