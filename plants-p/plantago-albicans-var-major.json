    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. major, commonly known as greater plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine, where it is used to treat skin irritations and digestive issues. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and form dense colonies."
