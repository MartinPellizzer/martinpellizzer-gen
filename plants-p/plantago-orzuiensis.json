    "intro": "Plantago orzuiensis, commonly known as the Orzui sandplant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
