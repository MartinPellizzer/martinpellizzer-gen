It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive sword-like shape. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with fertile and sterile pinnae often occurring on separate branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
