    "intro": "Pteris microptera, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris microptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
