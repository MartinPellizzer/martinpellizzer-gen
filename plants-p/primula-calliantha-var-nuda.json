    "intro": "Primula calliantha var. nuda, commonly known as the naked primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs compared to other Primula species, giving it a more streamlined appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
