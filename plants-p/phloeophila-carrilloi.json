    "intro": "Phloeophila carrilloi, commonly known as the Carrillo's phloeophila, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a yellowish color, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phloeophila carrilloi is considered a vulnerable species."
