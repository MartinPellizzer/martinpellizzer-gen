    "intro": "Piptospatha manduensis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Piptospatha manduensis is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
