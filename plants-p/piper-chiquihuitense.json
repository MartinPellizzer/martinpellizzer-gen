It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Jalisco, where it grows in humid, tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, heart-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a peppery berry that is used in traditional Mexican cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
