    "intro": "Pourouma apaporiensis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant river bamboo, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in wetland and riparian habitats. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, making it a visually dominant species in its environment. Its stems are jointed and often form dense clumps, contributing to its structural complexity. The botanical features of this plant make it an important component of the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
