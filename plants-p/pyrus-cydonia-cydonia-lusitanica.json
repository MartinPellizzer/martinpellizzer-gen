    "intro": "Pyrus-cydonia cydonia lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian pear, is a rare and ancient species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, deciduous tree that produces edible fruits with a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant has a compact growth habit and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
