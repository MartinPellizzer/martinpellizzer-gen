    "intro": "Portulaca cyanosperma, commonly known as blue-flowered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its flowers are typically small, measuring around 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Portulaca cyanosperma is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils or along dry streambeds."
