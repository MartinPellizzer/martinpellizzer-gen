    "intro": "Psilocarya divergens, commonly known as the divergent psilocybe, is a species of psychedelic mushroom characterized by its distinctive cap and stem morphology. It belongs to the family Psilocybiaceae and is native to certain regions of Central and South America. The fruiting bodies typically have a bell-shaped cap that becomes convex with age, and the stem is often adorned with a ring-like structure. Its spores are borne on a gleba that is initially white and becomes bluish-green as it matures. This species is notable for containing psilocybin and psilocin, which are psychoactive compounds responsible for its hallucinogenic effects."
