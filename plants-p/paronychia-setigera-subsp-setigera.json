    "intro": "Paronychia setigera subsp. setigera, commonly known as the slender leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically features small, fleshy, green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed areas. It is often found in gravelly soils along dry streambeds and slopes."
