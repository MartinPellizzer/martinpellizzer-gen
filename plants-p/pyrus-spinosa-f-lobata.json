    "intro": "Pyrus spinosa f. lobata, commonly known as the lobed spindle tree, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and alternate, lobed leaves that give it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to apples but smaller and more tart. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and hardy nature."
