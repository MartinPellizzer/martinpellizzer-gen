    "intro": "Phlox rigida, commonly known as rigid phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Phlox rigida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
