    "intro": "Primula dryadifolia subsp. chlorodryas, commonly known as the greenleaf primrose, is a rare and delicate herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features basal leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking presence to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
