    "intro": "Pellaeopsis articulata, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, segmented appearance with closely spaced, rhizoidal structures that help anchor it to substrates. Its leaves are usually arranged in two rows and are often covered with a layer of oil glands. Pellaeopsis articulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
