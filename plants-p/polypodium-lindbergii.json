    "intro": "Polypodium lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium lindbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
