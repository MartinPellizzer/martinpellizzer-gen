The plant typically features showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface that provides some resistance to water loss. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
