    "intro": "Pupalia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Pupalia velutina is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
