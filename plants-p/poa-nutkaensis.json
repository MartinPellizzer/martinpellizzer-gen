    "intro": "Poa nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, often bluish-gray foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
