    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus gounellei, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
