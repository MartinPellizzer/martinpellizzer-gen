    "intro": "Polypodium pleiosoroides, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, broad, and slightly curled appearance."
