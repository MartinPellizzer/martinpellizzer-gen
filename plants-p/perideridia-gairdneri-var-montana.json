    "intro": "Perideridia gairdneri var. montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as meadows and forest understories. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. Its stems are often hairy and bear small, paired stipules. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
