    "intro": "Potentilla axilliflora, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in the leaf axils, giving it its species name \"axilliflora.\" Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Potentilla axilliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
