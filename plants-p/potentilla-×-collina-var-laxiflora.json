    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. laxiflora, commonly known as the laxiflora cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, rounded form, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval to ovate leaflets that are hairy beneath. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for alpine gardens."
