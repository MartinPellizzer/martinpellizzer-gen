    "intro": "Pimpinella cnidioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The species is notable for its potential medicinal properties and its role in supporting local insect populations."
