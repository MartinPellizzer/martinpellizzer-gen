    "intro": "Pseudocimum, commonly known as the false cumin, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the carrot family. Its seeds are often used as a spice, though they are not related to true cumin. Pseudocimum thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable plant for Mediterranean climates."
