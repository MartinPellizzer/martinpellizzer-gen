    "intro": "Populus monilifera var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The wood is soft and lightweight, making it suitable for paper production and other industrial uses."
