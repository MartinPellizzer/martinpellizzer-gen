    "intro": "Platanthera gibbsiae, commonly known as Gibbs' lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a long, slender flowering stem that bears a dense spike of pale to dark purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soil. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, elongated inflorescence with numerous small, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
