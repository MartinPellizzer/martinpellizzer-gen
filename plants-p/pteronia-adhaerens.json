    "intro": "Pteronia adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky pteronia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and provides some natural protection against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in late spring and early summer, adding vibrant color to the garden."
