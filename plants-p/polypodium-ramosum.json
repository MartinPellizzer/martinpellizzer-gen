    "intro": "Polypodium ramosum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to climb using its fronds, which can form dense mats or vines. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium ramosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
