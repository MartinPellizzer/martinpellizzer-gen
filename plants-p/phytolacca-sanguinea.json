    "intro": "Phytolacca sanguinea, commonly known as red lac or blood lac, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
