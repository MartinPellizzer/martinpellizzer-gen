    "intro": "Polystichum munitum f. nudatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the sword fern that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its reduced or absent fronds, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical form. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
