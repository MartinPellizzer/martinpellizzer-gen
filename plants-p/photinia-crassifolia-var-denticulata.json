    "intro": "Photinia crassifolia var. denticulata, commonly known as the serrated photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The varietal form, denticulata, is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins."
