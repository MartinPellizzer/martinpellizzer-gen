    "intro": "Polygala psammophila, commonly known as the sand polygala, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its growth habit is often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique adaptations, Polygala psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
