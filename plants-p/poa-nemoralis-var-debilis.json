    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. debilis, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
