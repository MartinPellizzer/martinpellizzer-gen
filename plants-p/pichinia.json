These plants are characterized by their woody stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Pichinia species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They produce small, often edible fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. The genus is part of the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes other drought-tolerant plants."
