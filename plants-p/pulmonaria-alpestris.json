    "intro": "Pulmonaria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that range in color from silver to green, often with pink or purple markings. The plant produces upright, spike-like inflorescences of tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Pulmonaria alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
