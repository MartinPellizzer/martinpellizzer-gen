    "intro": "Potentilla adnata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives it its common name and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Potentilla adnata is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh alpine conditions."
