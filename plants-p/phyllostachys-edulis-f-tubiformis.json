    "intro": "Phyllostachys edulis f. tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular bamboo, is a unique variant of the common bamboo species. It is characterized by its distinctive tubular or cylindrical-shaped culms, which differ from the typical round or polygonal shapes of other bamboo varieties. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The tubular structure of its stems makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and specialty bamboo cultivation. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
