    "intro": "Pseudocarpidium avicennioides, commonly known as the mangrove pseudocarpidium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. The plant has a unique root system that includes both aerial roots and submerged roots, aiding in oxygen absorption and stabilization in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by water."
