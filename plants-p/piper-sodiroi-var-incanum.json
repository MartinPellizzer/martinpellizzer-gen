It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
