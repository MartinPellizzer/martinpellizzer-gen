    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in urban environments. This variety is closely related to other plantain species and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
