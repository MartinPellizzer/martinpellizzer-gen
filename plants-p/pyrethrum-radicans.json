    "intro": "Pyrethrum radicans, commonly known as creeping pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trailing stems that produce clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is known for its bright, showy blooms that appear throughout the growing season. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with finely toothed leaves that help distinguish it from similar species. Pyrethrum radicans is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
