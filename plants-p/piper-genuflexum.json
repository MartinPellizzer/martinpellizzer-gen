It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly peppery aroma when crushed. Piper genuflexum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique growth habit."
