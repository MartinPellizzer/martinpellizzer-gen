It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Palicourea microcarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and secondary growth areas."
