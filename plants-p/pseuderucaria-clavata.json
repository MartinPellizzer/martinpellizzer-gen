    "intro": "Pseuderucaria clavata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
