    "intro": "Polypodium cruciforme, commonly known as the cross fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cruciform (cross-shaped) fronds that are divided into four parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a notable feature in its natural habitat."
