    "intro": "Psammisia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that hang from the stems, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psammisia penduliflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
