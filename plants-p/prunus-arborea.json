    "intro": "Prunus arborea, commonly known as the silktree or silk thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorned branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits called drupes, which are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus arborea is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
