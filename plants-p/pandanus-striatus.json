It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense, bottlebrush-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that contains edible seeds. Pandanus striatus is often grown for its ornamental value and cultural significance in island communities."
