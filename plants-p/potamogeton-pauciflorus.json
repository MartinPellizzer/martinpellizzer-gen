It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered near the base of the stems. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Potamogeton pauciflorus is often found in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams."
