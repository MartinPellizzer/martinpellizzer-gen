    "intro": "Pinus fastuosa, commonly known as the golden bark pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-brown bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The tree has slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 3 to 5 inches long. It produces cones that are about 2 to 3 inches in length, containing edible seeds. This plant is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and pine flatwoods."
