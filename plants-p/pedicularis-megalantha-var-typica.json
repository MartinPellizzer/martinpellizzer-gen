    "intro": "Pedicularis megalantha var. typica, commonly known as the giant lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. It thrives in alpine environments and is often found growing on the roots of other vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
