    "intro": "Pilosella calodon subsp. multiceps, commonly known as the hairy leaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens as a decorative plant."
