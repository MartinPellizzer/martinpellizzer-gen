    "intro": "Pellaea scabra, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its stiff, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
