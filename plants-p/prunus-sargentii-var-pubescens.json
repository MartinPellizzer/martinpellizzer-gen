    "intro": "Prunus sargentii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Sargent cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and distinctive, finely hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin and a pale green underside. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that ripen in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits."
