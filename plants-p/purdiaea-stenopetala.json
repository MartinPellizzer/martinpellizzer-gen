    "intro": "Purdiaea stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or violet hue at the base. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
