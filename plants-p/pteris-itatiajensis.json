    "intro": "Pteris itatiajensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia water fern, is a species of fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, lanceolate leaves. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that aids in water retention and photosynthesis."
