    "intro": "Panax cuphocarpus, commonly known as the golden ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow roots and dark green foliage. The plant is known for its slow growth and long maturation period, often taking over a decade to reach maturity. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly valued in traditional medicine and conservation efforts."
