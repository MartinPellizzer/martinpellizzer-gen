    "intro": "Polium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean flatweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
