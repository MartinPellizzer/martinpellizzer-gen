    "intro": "Platanthera zothecina, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, with the petals and sepals forming a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest understories, often near streams or wetlands. The orchid is pollinated by flies and is considered rare due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
