    "intro": "Poa uninervia, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or brown in color, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Poa uninervia is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for various herbivores."
