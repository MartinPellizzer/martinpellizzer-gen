    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated pine, is a variant of the serotinous pine native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated cones that are often curved at the apex, a feature that distinguishes it from other pine species. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Its cones remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only after a fire or mechanical disturbance. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
