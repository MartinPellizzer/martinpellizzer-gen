    "intro": "Paracaryum kurdistanicum, commonly known as the Kurdish cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Iraq, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves. Its reproductive structures include a large, spore-bearing cone at the base of the plant. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
