    "intro": "Palaquium loheri, commonly known as the Loher's wax apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible, waxy fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in traditional medicine. Palaquium loheri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
