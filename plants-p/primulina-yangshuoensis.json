    "intro": "Primulina yangshuoensis, commonly known as the Yangshuo gloxinia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or red, bloom in the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
