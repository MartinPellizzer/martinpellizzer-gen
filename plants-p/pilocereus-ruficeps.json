    "intro": "Pilocereus ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed night bloomer, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its flowers open in response to cooler temperatures and darkness, a trait common among many nocturnal flowering plants. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
