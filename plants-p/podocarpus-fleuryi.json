    "intro": "Podocarpus fleuryi, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive yellowish-brown bark. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is cultivated as a landscape plant in various parts of the world."
