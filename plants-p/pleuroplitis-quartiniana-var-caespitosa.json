    "intro": "Pleuroplitis quartiniana var. caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense clumps, which help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
