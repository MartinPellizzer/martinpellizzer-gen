    "intro": "Plantago calabrica, commonly known as the Calabrian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
