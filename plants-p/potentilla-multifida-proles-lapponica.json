    "intro": "Potentilla multifida proles lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in harsh environments."
