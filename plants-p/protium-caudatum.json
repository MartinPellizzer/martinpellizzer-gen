It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its latex has been historically used in the production of sandarac, a natural resin. Protium caudatum is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
