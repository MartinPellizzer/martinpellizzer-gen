The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive hooded structure. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
