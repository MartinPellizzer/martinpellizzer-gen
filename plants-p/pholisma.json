    "intro": "Pholisma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loasaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Pholisma species are typically perennial, forming low-growing mats that are adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
