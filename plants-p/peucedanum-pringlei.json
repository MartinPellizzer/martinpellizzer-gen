    "intro": "Peucedanum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and its seeds are enclosed in a bristly fruit. Peucedanum pringlei is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
