    "intro": "Pleopeltis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
