    "intro": "Pachystelma, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These succulent plants are native to southern Africa, particularly in rocky and arid environments. They are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which help them store water and survive in harsh conditions. The flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive shape and color, often in shades of yellow or orange. Pachystelma species are popular among succulent collectors due to their unique appearance and ease of care."
