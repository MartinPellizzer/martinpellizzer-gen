    "intro": "Pinus strobus, commonly known as eastern white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in bundles of five, and its distinctive, soft, gray bark. The tree produces cones that are typically 4 to 8 inches long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Eastern white pine thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems and has historical significance in indigenous cultures and early American industries."
