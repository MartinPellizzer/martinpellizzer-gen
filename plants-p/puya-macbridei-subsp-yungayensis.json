    "intro": "Puya macbridei subsp. yungayensis, commonly known as the Yungayensis Puya, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and vibrant floral displays. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
