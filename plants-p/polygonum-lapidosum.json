    "intro": "Polygonum lapidosum, commonly known as the stonebreaker, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Polygonum lapidosum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
