    "intro": "Pleurostylia pallens, commonly known as the pale pleurostylia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
