    "intro": "Pleisolirion liliastrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooms appear in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
