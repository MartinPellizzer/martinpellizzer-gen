    "intro": "Psilocaulon framesii, commonly known as the frame's psilocaulon, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features include a slender, branching stem and finely divided leaves that resemble those of a fern. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
