    "intro": "Pedicularis tongolensis, commonly known as the Tongol monkey orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble monkey faces, hence its common name. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
