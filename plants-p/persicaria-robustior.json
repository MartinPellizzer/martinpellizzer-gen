    "intro": "Persicaria robustior, commonly known as broadleaf hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
