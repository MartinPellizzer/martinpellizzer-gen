    "intro": "Polypodium sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium sprengelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
