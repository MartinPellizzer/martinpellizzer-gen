    "intro": "Pircunia drastica, commonly known as the dramatic pircun, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery hair layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
