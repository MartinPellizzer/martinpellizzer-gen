    "intro": "Picea abies f. cupressina, commonly known as the Norway spruce compact form, is a naturally occurring variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and shorter, more compact branches compared to the typical Norway spruce. The foliage is needle-like, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. This form is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks due to its unique appearance. It retains the typical coniferous characteristics of the parent species, including the production of cones and the ability to thrive in temperate climates."
