    "intro": "Ptilotus exaltatus, commonly known as the \"Desert Flax,\" is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy capsules, which aid in wind dispersal. Ptilotus exaltatus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
