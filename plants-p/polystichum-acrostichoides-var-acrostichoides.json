    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides var. acrostichoides, commonly known as the coastal shield fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the eastern coast of North America. It features tall, arching fronds with a dark green, leathery texture that provides a striking visual contrast to its pale, silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing along coastal areas and in shaded woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural and cultivated landscapes."
