    "intro": "Pimelea aridula subsp. oliga, commonly known as the slender pimelea, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to low-nutrient conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
