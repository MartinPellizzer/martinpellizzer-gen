    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. humifusum, commonly known as creeping knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to environmental stress."
