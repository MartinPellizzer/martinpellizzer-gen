    "intro": "Prasophyllum readii, commonly known as the Read's leek orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a significant species in the study of alpine flora."
