    "intro": "Polypodium phymatodioides, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen, with a serrated or lobed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
