    "intro": "Pteris serrulata, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely toothed along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
