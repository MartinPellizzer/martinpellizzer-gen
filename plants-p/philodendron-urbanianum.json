    "intro": "Philodendron urbanianum, commonly known as the urbanianum philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits that mature to a yellow or red color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
