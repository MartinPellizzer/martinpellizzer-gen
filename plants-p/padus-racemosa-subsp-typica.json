It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with serrated edges. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
