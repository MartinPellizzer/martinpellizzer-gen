    "intro": "Passiflora multiflora, commonly known as the tropical passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a crown of filaments and a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or used in jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora multiflora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
