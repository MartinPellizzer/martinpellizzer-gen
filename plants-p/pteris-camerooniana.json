    "intro": "Pteris camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can be used as a natural indicator of soil moisture levels. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
