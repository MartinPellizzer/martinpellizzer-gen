    "intro": "Polylepis incarum, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often fissured bark, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Polylepis incarum is a slow-growing, long-lived species that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
