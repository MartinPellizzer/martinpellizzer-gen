    "intro": "Psychrogeton capusii, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to grow at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. Psychrogeton capusii is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
