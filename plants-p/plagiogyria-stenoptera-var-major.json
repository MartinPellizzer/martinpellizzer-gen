    "intro": "Plagiogyria stenoptera var. major, commonly known as the narrow-leafed plagiogyria, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
