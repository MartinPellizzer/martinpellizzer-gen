    "intro": "Prenanthes rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a short stalk connecting them to the submerged stems. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer. Prenanthes rostrata plays a role in providing habitat and food for aquatic insects and other wildlife."
