    "intro": "Paspalum dactylon, commonly known as perennial grass or cogongrass, is a tropical and subtropical plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial grass that forms dense, spreading colonies through its rhizomes and stolons. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
