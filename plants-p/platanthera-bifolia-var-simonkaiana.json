    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. simonkaiana, commonly known as the Simonka's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a distinctive floral arrangement of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heaths. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
