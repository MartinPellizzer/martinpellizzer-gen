    "intro": "Polypodium maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium maingayi is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
