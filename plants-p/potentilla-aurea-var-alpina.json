    "intro": "Potentilla aurea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
