    "intro": "Psedera vitacea var. laciniata, commonly known as the shredded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bi-lobed leaves that are deeply notched, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators."
