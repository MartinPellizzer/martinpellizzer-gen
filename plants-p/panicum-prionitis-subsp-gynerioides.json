    "intro": "Panicum prionitis subsp. gynerioides, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth or slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets that are often greenish or reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
