    "intro": "Pourthiaea arguta var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous pourthiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The variety 'membranacea' is distinguished by its thin, membranous leaf blades, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
