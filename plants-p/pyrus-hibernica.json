It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Due to its historical and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
