    "intro": "Psychotria epiphytica, commonly known as the sacred yew or the ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers and red berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its unique growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
