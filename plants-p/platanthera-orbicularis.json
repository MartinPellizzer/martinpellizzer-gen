    "intro": "Platanthera orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Platanthera orbicularis relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
