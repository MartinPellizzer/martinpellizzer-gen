    "intro": "Pogonia discolor, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves, and it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Pogonia discolor is considered endangered in many regions."
