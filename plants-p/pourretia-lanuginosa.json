    "intro": "Pourretia lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features soft, hairy leaves that are typically ovate to\u692d\u5706\u5f62, with a grayish-green appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
