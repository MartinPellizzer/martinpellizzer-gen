    "intro": "Pandanus cornifer, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are long and narrow, often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Pandanus cornifer thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline."
