    "intro": "Phaeocephalum axillare, commonly known as the axillary phaeocephalum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in woodland gardens."
