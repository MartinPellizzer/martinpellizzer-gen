It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
