    "intro": "Pitcairnia singularis, commonly known as the singular pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of both horticultural interest and conservation efforts."
