    "intro": "Plantago sericea subsp. caulescens, commonly known as silky plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of soft, silver-green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
