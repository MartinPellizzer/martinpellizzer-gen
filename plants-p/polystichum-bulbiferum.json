    "intro": "Polystichum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The unique feature of this fern is its ability to produce bulb-like structures, which can give rise to new plants."
