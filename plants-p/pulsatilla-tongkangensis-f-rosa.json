It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine meadows, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. This fern-like plant is noted for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics."
