    "intro": "Parodia, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their compact, globular shape and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Parodia species typically have a dense covering of white or pale spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them ideal for succulent gardens. The genus includes several species, such as Parodia hillebrandii, which is particularly popular among cactus enthusiasts."
