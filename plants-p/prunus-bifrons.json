    "intro": "Prunus bifrons, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in spring, typically white or pink, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Prunus bifrons is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
