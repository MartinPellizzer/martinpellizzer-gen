    "intro": "Poa lepidula, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Poa lepidula is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
