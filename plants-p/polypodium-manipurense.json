    "intro": "Polypodium manipurense, commonly known as the Manipur water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly Manipur, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid forest habitats."
