It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has compound leaves composed of five oval-shaped leaflets, which are hairy and slightly serrated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
