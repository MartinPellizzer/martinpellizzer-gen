    "intro": "Panicum macrum, commonly known as the rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Panicum macrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
