It is native to southern China, particularly in the Guangxi region, and is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It has a clumping growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil. Pleioblastus kwangsiensis is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
