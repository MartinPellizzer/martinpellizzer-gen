    "intro": "Platostoma hemratianum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that form dense, cushion-like growths. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, releasing spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platostoma hemratianum is considered a species of conservation concern."
