    "intro": "Prepusa viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered prepusa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has heart-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Prepusa viridiflora is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in local ecosystems."
