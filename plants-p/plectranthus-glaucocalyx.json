It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to blue in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it both visually appealing and easy to maintain."
