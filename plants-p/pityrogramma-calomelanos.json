    "intro": "Pityrogramma calomelanos, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled when young. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pityrogramma calomelanos is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
