    "intro": "Picea orientalis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Oriental spruce, is a compact form of the Oriental spruce, characterized by its slow growth and dense, conical shape. It features short, stiff needles that are dark green and arranged in clusters, giving it a unique, compact appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of coniferous species. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
