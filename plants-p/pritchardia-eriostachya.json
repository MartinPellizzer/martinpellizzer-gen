It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, which are followed by orange or red fruits.

Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
