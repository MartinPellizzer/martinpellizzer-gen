    "intro": "Piofontia apiculata, commonly known as the spiny piofontia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and typically display shades of red and purple. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Piofontia apiculata is considered a species of conservation concern."
