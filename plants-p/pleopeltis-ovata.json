    "intro": "Pleopeltis ovata, commonly known as the ovate pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pleopeltis ovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation."
