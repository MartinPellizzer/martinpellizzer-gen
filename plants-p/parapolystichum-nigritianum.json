It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
