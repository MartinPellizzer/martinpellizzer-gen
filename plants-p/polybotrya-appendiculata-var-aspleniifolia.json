    "intro": "Polybotrya appendiculata var. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
