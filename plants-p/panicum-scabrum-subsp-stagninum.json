    "intro": "Panicum scabrum subsp. stagninum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikes of small, bristly flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological success in wetland environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
