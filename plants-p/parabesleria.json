    "intro": "Parabesleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Parabesleria is considered endangered in its native range."
