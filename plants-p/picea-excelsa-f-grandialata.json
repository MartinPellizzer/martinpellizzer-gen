    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. grandialata, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. The foliage consists of dense, needle-like leaves that are typically white or pale blue-gray, providing a striking visual contrast against the mountainous landscape. This form is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments with poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to alpine gardens and conservation areas."
