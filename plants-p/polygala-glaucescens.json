    "intro": "Polygala glaucescens, commonly known as the blue milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by insects."
