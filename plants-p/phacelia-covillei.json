    "intro": "Phacelia covillei, commonly known as Coville's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Coville's phacelia is often found in desert scrub and woodland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
