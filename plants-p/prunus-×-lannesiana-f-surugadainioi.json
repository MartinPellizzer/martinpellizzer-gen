    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. surugadainioi, commonly known as the Surugadainioi cherry, is a unique ornamental plant characterized by its compact growth habit and striking foliage. It is a natural hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis, resulting in a plant with distinctive leaf patterns and a dense, rounded form. The leaves are typically a deep green with a silvery-blue underside, providing an attractive contrast in the garden. It produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are prized for their tart flavor. This variety is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its manageable size and ornamental value."
