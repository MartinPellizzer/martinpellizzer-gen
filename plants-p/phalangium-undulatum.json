    "intro": "Phalangium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy flatworm, is a species of flatworm belonging to the family Dendrocoelidae. It is a free-living, aquatic flatworm found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The worm has a flattened, ribbon-like body with a wavy appearance due to its undulating movements. It lacks a true digestive system and absorbs nutrients directly through its skin. Phalangium undulatum is primarily a predator, feeding on small invertebrates like rotifers and nematodes."
