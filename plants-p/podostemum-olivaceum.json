    "intro": "Podostemum olivaceum, commonly known as the olive river-mallow, is a unique aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically found near the water's surface. Podostemum olivaceum thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments. Its specialized morphology allows it to anchor itself to rocks and withstand strong currents."
