    "intro": "Pterocephalus perennis f. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered pterocephalus, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Pterocephalus genus. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a rare and sought-after plant among botanists and horticulturists."
