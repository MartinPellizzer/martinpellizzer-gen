It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Pilosella subaurantiaca typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
