    "intro": "Phyllorkis lasiochila, commonly known as the silky leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which feed on the fleshy, red berries. This plant is native to parts of Australia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
