    "intro": "Pavetta paludosa, commonly known as swamp pavetta, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in moist or swampy areas, often forming dense ground cover with its low, spreading stems. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the wet season. Pavetta paludosa has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting it to its humid, aquatic environment."
