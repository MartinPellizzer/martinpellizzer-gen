    "intro": "Polystichum consanguineum, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green coloration and prominent red veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
