    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. pinnatifida, commonly known as narrow-leaved selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a distinctive pinnatifid (bifurcated) margin, giving it a finely toothed appearance. Its flowers are small, pale blue to purple, and clustered in whorls along the stem, blooming from June to August. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
