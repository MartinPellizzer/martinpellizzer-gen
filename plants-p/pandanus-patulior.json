It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fibrous, pineapple-like fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and thatch. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or near the shoreline."
