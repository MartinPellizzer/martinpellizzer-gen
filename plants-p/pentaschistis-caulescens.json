It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a complex structure typical of orchids, and it blooms during the warmer months.
