It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. This variety is valued for its adaptability and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
