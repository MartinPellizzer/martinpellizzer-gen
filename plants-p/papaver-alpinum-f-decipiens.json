    "intro": "Papaver alpinum f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive alpine poppy, is a botanical variant of the alpine poppy species. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of other papaver species, potentially leading to confusion in identification. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive, spurred corona. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, flowering in early summer."
