The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats."
