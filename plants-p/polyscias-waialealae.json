    "intro": "Polyscias waialealae, commonly known as the Maui fan palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within mesic forests. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under conservation efforts. Its unique botanical features make it an important part of Maui's native flora."
