    "intro": "Polytrema, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that often have a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant is typically found in wet or marshy habitats across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Polytrema species are perennial herbs that often have fleshy roots and are adapted to moist environments. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as host plants for certain insects."
