    "intro": "Puccinellia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears few flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Puccinellia pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
