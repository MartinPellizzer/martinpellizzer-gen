    "intro": "Pinguicula crystallina subsp. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, glandular-stemmed leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with hairy structures, which give it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
