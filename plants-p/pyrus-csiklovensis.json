It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters, characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The fruit is a pear-like berry that ripens in late summer, featuring a yellowish skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
