    "intro": "Pulicaria pratensis, commonly known as common ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It is characterized by its glandular hairs and the presence of a milky sap. While it is not poisonous to humans, it can be toxic to livestock, particularly sheep."
