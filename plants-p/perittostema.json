    "intro": "Perittostema, commonly known as the \"bushy morning glory,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. Perittostema thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
