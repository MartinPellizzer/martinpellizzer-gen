    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. hirta, commonly known as hairy meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a cool-season grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its hairy texture on the leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of Poa. It is widely used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
