    "intro": "Potentilla flabelliformis, commonly known as the fanleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained, sunny habitats. Potentilla flabelliformis is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of rocky and open slopes."
