    "intro": "Podochilus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese orchid or golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that often feature a yellow or golden hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Podochilus chinensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
