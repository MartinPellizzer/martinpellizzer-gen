    "intro": "Polystichum pulchellum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a fine layer of silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright growth habit."
