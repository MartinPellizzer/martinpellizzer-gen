    "intro": "Pteridium falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bracken, is a fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive pale green color and a serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pteridium falcatum is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it an important component of forest ecosystems."
