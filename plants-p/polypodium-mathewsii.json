    "intro": "Polypodium mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium mathewsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
