    "intro": "Philodendron squamiferum var. aceriferum, commonly known as the golden shield philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of velvety, golden-yellow to reddish-brown hairs. The plant produces striking, shield-shaped bracts that enclose its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its foliage thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
