    "intro": "Phacelia breweri, commonly known as the Sierra phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Phacelia breweri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
