    "intro": "Phlox caespitosa var. hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's tufted phlox, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
