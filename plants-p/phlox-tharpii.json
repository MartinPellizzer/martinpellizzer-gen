    "intro": "Phlox tharpii, commonly known as sand phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-prone landscapes. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss. Phlox tharpii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
