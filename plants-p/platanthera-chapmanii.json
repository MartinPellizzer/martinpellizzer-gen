    "intro": "Platanthera chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
