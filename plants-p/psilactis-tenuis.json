    "intro": "Psilactis tenuis, commonly known as the slender psilactis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. Due to habitat loss, Psilactis tenuis is considered endangered in many regions."
