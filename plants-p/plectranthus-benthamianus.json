    "intro": "Plectranthus benthamianus, commonly known as the blue potato plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually blue-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or violet, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth when properly cared for."
