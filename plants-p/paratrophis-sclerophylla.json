    "intro": "Paratrophis sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed paratrophis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps reduce water loss. Paratrophis sclerophylla is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
