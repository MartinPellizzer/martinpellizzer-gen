It is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Polygonum plantagineum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in various habitats."
