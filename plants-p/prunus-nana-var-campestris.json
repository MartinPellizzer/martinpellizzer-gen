It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
