    "intro": "Platanthera robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, horizontal spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in wetlands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its rhizomatous growth habit. Platanthera robusta is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
