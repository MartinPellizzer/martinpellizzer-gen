    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subvar. virgata, commonly known as the silver fir or noble fir, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time. This subvariety is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cooler, higher-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive species within the pine family."
