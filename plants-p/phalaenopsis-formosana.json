    "intro": "Phalaenopsis formosana, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a species native to Taiwan. It is a type of epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid climate. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
