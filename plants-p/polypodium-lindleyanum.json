    "intro": "Polypodium lindleyanum, commonly known as the Lindley's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct rows. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
