    "intro": "Piper sylvaticum, commonly known as the West Indian pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, berry-like fruits. The fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly consumed than black pepper. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
