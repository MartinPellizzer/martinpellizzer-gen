    "intro": "Poa floribunda, commonly known as the showy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically bluish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Poa floribunda is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
