It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showing adaptations to high-altitude conditions. Its foliage is usually basal, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow or orange, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh climates."
