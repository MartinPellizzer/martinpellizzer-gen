It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
