    "intro": "Physianthus, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a unique genus of flowering plants native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent-like flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's botanical features include thick, waxy leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports its unusual floral display. Physianthus species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Due to their rarity and delicate nature, they are highly sought after in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
