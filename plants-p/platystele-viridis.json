    "intro": "Platystele viridis, commonly known as the green platystele, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or white, and are borne in a spike. Platystele viridis is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
