    "intro": "Perezia nutans, commonly known as the nodding perezia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Perezia nutans is considered a threatened species in its native range."
