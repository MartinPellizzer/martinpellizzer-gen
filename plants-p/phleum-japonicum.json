    "intro": "Phleum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese timothy grass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Phleum japonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
