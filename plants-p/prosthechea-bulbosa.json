    "intro": "Prosthechea bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
