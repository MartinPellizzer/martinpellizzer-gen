    "intro": "Polystichum tosaense, commonly known as the Tosa holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
