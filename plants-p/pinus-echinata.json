    "intro": "Pinus echinata, commonly known as the shortleaf pine, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its short, stout needles that are typically two to three inches long and have a distinctive resinous coating. The tree produces cones that are approximately 2 to 3 inches in length, with scales that are thick and persistent. Its bark is thick and scaly, becoming deeply furrowed with age. The shortleaf pine is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
