    "intro": "Phyllanthus lambertianus, commonly known as Lambert's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature of the genus Phyllanthus. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions. Its small, green leaves are opposite and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are unisexual and clustered in cyathia. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
