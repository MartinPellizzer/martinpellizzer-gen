    "intro": "Pouteria francii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense canopy, making it a significant component of the rainforest ecosystem. Its fruit, known as the Brazil nut, is enclosed in a hard shell and requires specific conditions to germinate. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its economic importance as a source of nuts."
