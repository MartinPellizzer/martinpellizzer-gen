    "intro": "Pteris muricata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
