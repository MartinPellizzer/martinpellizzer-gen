It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens with adequate space. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally grown as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
