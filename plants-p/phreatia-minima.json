    "intro": "Phreatia minima, commonly known as the small phreatia orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of pale green to white hair. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
