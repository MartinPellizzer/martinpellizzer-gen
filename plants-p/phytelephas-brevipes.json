    "intro": "Phytelephas brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sacha inchi, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oblong, woody fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are used in traditional Andean cuisine and modern health products. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and nutritional value."
