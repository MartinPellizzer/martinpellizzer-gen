    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. minor, commonly known as the lesser silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features wiry, sprawling stems covered in silvery-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats."
