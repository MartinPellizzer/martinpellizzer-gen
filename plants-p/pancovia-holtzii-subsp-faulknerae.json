    "intro": "Pancovia holtzii subsp. faulknerae, commonly known as the Falkner's pancovia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure, which set it apart from other members of the Pancovia genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
