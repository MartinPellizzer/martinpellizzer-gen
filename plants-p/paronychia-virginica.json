    "intro": "Paronychia virginica, commonly known as the Virginia sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its ability to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in coastal or coastal plain environments."
