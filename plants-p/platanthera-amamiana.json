    "intro": "Platanthera amamiana, commonly known as the Amami ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, moist soil, often found in forests or near water sources. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
