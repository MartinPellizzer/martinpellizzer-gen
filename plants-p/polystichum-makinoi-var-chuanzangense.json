    "intro": "Polystichum makinoi var. chuanzangense, commonly known as the Chuanzangense Hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the Hart's-tongue fern native to China. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. The plant features leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are tightly clasping around the central stalk. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
