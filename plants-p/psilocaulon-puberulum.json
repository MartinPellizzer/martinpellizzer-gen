    "intro": "Psilocaulon puberulum, commonly known as the hairy psilocaulon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
