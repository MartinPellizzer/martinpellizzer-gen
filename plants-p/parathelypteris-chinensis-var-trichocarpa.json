    "intro": "Parathelypteris chinensis var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
