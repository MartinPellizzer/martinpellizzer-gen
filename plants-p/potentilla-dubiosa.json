    "intro": "Potentilla dubiosa, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Potentilla dubiosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
