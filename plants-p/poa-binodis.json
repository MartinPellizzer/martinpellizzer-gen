    "intro": "Poa binodis, commonly known as the two-node grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Poa binodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
