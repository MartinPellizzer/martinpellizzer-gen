    "intro": "Plantago major var. crispa, commonly known as the curly plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its distinctive wavy, curly leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and gardens. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The curly form of the leaves is a result of genetic variation that leads to a unique, decorative appearance."
