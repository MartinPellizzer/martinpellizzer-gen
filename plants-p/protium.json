    "intro": "Protium, commonly known as the wild cashew or Indian cashew, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are evergreen trees native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. The fruit is a drupe, often containing a single seed enclosed in a hard shell. Protium species are valued for their ornamental value, timber, and, in some cases, their edible seeds."
