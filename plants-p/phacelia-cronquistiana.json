    "intro": "Phacelia cronquistiana, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. Phacelia cronquistiana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
