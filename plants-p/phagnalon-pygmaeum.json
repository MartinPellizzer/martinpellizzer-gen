    "intro": "Phagnalon pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Phagnalon pygmaeum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
