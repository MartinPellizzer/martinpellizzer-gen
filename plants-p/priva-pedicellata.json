    "intro": "Priva pedicellata, commonly known as the clustered privet, is a shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. These flowers are followed by small, spherical berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Priva pedicellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
