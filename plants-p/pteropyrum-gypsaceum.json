    "intro": "Pteropyrum gypsaceum, commonly known as the gypsum plant, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, gypsum-rich soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments, contributing to its ecological significance in dryland ecosystems."
