    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris schizochlamys, commonly known as the split-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside of the leaves. Its unique morphology, including the division of the fronds into smaller, segmented parts, contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
