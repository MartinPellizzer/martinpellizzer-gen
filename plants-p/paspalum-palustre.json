    "intro": "Paspalum palustre, commonly known as marsh grass or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is adapted to saturated soil conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Paspalum palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
