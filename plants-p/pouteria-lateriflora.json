    "intro": "Pouteria lateriflora, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and distinctive, clustered flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are highly valued in both culinary and medicinal contexts. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
