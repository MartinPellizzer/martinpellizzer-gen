    "intro": "Polygonum corymbosum, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright stems that are often reddish near the base, and its alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called corymbs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Polygonum corymbosum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
