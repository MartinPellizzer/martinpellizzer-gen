    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a prized addition to alpine and woodland gardens."
