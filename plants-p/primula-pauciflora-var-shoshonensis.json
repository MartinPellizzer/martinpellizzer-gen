    "intro": "Primula pauciflora var. shoshonensis, commonly known as the Shoshone primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
