It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a single, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulb. The plant produces a single, showy, lip-shaped flower with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts."
