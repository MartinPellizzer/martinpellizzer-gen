    "intro": "Porpax repens, commonly known as creeping porpax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family. Porpax repens thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
