    "intro": "Pleione concolor, commonly known as the white pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded forest environments, and requires cool, moist conditions to thrive. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form clumps over time, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
