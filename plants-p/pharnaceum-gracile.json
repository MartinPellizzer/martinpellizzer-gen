    "intro": "Pharnaceum gracile, commonly known as the slender pharnaceum, is a delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pharnaceum gracile is considered a threatened species in its native range."
