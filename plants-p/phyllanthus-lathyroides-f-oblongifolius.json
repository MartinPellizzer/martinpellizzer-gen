    "intro": "Phyllanthus lathyroides f. oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a variant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. Its stems are usually hairy and can exude a milky sap when broken. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
