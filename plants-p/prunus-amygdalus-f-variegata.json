Its leaves exhibit a variegated pattern of green, white, and sometimes pink, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible nuts similar to those of the common almond. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. While it is less commonly cultivated for its nuts, it is highly valued as a decorative plant in horticulture."
