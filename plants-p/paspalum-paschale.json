    "intro": "Paspalum paschale, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and wetlands, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, producing small, two-lobed flowers. Paspalum paschale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
