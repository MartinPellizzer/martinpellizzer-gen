    "intro": "Pilosella tardiuscula subsp. tardiuscula, commonly known as the slender pappus hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has slender, hairy stems and leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
