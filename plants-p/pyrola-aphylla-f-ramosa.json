    "intro": "Pyrola aphylla f. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This variant is distinguished by its more branched stems compared to the typical form, giving it a more open and sprawling appearance."
