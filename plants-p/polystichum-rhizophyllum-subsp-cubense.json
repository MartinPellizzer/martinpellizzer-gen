    "intro": "Polystichum rhizophyllum subsp. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies cubense is native to parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
