    "intro": "Poa angustifolia var. alpigena, commonly known as alpine narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
