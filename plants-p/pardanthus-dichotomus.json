    "intro": "Pardanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in grassland habitats. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in pairs along the stem. Pardanthus dichotomus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment."
