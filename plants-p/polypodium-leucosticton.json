    "intro": "Polypodium leucosticton, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture and is characterized by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Polypodium leucosticton is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
