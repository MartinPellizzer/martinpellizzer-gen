It features tall, upright stems that produce striking blue to violet tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
