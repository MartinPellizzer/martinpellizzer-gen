    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. bifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
