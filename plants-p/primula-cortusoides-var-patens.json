    "intro": "Primula cortusoides var. patens, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it an excellent ground cover for shaded areas in botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
