It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and striking red or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often floating or partially submerged depending on water levels. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
