    "intro": "Panax ferox, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy roots that are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots contain bioactive compounds such as ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and therapeutic properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax ferox is now classified as an endangered species."
