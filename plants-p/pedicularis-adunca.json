    "intro": "Pedicularis adunca, commonly known as the long-horned monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of the genus *Mimulus*. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
