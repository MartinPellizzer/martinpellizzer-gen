    "intro": "Pinus escandoniana, commonly known as the Escandon pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features include a straight trunk and a conical crown, typical of many pine species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
