    "intro": "Pelargonium weberi, commonly known as Weber's geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate watering to prevent root rot. Pelargonium weberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor gardening."
