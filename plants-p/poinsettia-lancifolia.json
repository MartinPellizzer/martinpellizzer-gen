    "intro": "Poinsettia lancifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf poinsettia, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, also known as the spurge family, and is closely related to other poinsettia species. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped, giving it the \"lancifolia\" designation, and it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. Poinsettia lancifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially during the holiday season."
