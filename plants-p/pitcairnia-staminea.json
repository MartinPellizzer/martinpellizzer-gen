    "intro": "Pitcairnia staminea, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from a central stem, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Pitcairnia staminea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and adaptability to indoor conditions."
