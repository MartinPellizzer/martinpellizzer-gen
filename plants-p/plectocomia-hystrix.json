    "intro": "Plectocomia hystrix, commonly known as the spiny plectocomia, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and small, sharp spines along the edges. Plectocomia hystrix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in sunny environments."
