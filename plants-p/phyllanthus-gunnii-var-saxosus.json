    "intro": "Phyllanthus gunnii var. saxosus, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
