    "intro": "Pterostylis \u00d7 aenigma, commonly known as the mystery orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pterostylis chloropus and Pterostylis maculata. It is a terrestrial orchid with a single, slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The flowers are characterized by their unique morphology, with a labellum that resembles a small insect, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. It is native to southeastern Australia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
