    "intro": "Pterozonium retroflexum, commonly known as the backward-leafed fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its fronds are typically elongated and have a retroflex arrangement, meaning they curl backward, which is a rare trait among ferns. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
