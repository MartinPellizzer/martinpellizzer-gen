    "intro": "Polygonum tenue var. protrusum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, often with a slightly reddish tinge. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges."
