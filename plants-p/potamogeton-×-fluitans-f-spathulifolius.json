    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 fluitans f. spathulifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stem. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often floating on the water surface. Its leaves are usually submerged, with some emergent portions, and it can form dense underwater vegetation. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth."
