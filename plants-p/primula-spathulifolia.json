    "intro": "Primula spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features rosettes of broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its delicate appearance and early spring bloom."
