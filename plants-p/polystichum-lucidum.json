    "intro": "Polystichum lucidum, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are covered in a waxy, glossy cuticle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and maturing throughout the growing season."
