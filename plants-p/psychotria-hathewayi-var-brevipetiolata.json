    "intro": "Psychotria hathewayi var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with short petioles and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
