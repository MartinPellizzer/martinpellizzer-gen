It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lacy pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Pteris sinensis is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
