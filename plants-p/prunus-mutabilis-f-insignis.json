It is characterized by its white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant is a small deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of 3 to 5 meters. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
