    "intro": "Phlox penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink to lavender. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Phlox penduliflora is well-suited for rock gardens, hanging baskets, or as a border plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
