    "intro": "Phegopteris persicifolia, commonly known as the Persian water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
