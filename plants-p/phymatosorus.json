    "intro": "Phymatosorus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit, with rhizomes that can be either terrestrial or attached to rocks. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, sometimes lobed, appearance. Phymatosorus species are often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or on rock surfaces. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
