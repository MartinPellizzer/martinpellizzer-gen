    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. schwarzii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
