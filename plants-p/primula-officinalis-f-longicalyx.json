    "intro": "Primula officinalis f. longicalyx, commonly known as the long-leaved primrose, is a botanical variant of the primrose species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. The f. longicalyx form is distinguished by its notably longer leaves compared to the typical variety of Primula officinalis."
