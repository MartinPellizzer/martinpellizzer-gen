    "intro": "Pandanus toinu, commonly known as the Tahitian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, fibrous leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in a spike at the center of the leaf rosette. Its roots are fibrous and used in traditional crafts, while the leaves are utilized for thatching and weaving. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring warm, humid climates with well-draining soil."
