    "intro": "Pharbitis speciosa, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, vibrant blue or purple flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Its climbing habit is facilitated by its spiraling stems, which wrap around supports. The leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
