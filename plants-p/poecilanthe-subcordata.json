    "intro": "Poecilanthe subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starling plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
