    "intro": "Polypodium palmatopedatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
