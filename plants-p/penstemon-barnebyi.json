    "intro": "Penstemon barnebyi, commonly known as the Barneby's beardtongue, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems with lance-shaped leaves and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. It is valued in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Penstemon barnebyi is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
