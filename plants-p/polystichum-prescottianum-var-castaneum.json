    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum var. castaneum, commonly known as the castaneum wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
