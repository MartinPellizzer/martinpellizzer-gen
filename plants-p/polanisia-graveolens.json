    "intro": "Polanisia graveolens, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in woodland edges or along roadsides. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, especially when the leaves are crushed."
