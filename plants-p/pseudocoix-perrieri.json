    "intro": "Pseudocoix perrieri, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It thrives in wetlands and marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish dense colonies. Its most distinctive feature is the edible, starchy tuber that develops underground. The leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, and the plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer."
