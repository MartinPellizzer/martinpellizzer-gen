    "intro": "Pouteria sandwicensis f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered breadfruit, is a variant of the breadfruit tree native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically more numerous than in the typical form. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to other breadfruit varieties, though the fruiting pattern and floral density differ. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique floral structure and potential agricultural value."
