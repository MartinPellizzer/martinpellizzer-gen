It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like orange-red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
