    "intro": "Prunus martabanica var. scortechinii, commonly known as the Martaban cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruits are small, hard drupes that turn red when mature, and the plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
