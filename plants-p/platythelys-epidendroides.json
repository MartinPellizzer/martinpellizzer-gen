    "intro": "Platythelys epidendroides, commonly known as the broad-leafed epidendroid, is a unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and clustered inflorescences that produce small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
