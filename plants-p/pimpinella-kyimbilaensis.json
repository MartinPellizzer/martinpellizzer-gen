    "intro": "Pimpinella kyimbilaensis, commonly known as the Kyimbila angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
