    "intro": "Procris elegans, commonly known as the elegant fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
