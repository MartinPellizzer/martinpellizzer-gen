    "intro": "Peucedanum harry-smithii var. subglabrum, commonly known as Harry Smith's angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive silvery-gray underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
