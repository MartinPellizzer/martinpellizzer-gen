    "intro": "Proteocarpus atrofuscus, commonly known as the black-leaved bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, glossy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting various insect and bird species."
