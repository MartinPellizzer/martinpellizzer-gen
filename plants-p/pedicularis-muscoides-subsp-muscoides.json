    "intro": "Pedicularis muscoides subsp. muscoides, commonly known as the musk orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it survive in its alpine or subalpine habitats. It relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among parasitic or semi-parasitic plants. The flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
