It has long, slender leaves that are typically ribbon-shaped and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Asiatic pondweed plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
