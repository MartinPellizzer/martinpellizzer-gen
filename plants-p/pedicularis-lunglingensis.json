    "intro": "Pedicularis lunglingensis, commonly known as the Lungling Snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of China. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
