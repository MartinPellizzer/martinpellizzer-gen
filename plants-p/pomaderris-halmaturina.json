    "intro": "Pomaderris halmaturina, commonly known as the Halmaturina pomaderris, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, yellow fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
