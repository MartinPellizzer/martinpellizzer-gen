    "intro": "Picea rubra f. virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's pine, is a rare and distinctive form of the red spruce. It is characterized by its pale, almost white bark and its smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical red spruce. This variant is native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States, where it thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils. The plant is a coniferous evergreen, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and is often found in mixed forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
