It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among plants in open, dry habitats. Psammotropha stipulacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
