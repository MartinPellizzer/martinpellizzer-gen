    "intro": "Photinia berberidifolia, commonly known as the golden photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-red foliage, which provides striking visual contrast in gardens. The plant features small, white, five-petaled flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a glossy surface. Photinia berberidifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
