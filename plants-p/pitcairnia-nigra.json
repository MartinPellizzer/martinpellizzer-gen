    "intro": "Pitcairnia nigra, commonly known as the black pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia nigra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in botanical gardens and private collections."
