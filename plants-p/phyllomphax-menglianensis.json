    "intro": "Phyllomphax menglianensis, commonly known as the Menglian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
