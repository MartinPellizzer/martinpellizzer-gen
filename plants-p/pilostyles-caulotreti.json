    "intro": "Pilostyles caulotreti, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits a highly specialized parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of minute seeds that can remain dormant for long periods. Despite its lack of traditional leaves and roots, Pilostyles caulotreti plays a niche ecological role in certain tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
