    "intro": "Phyllostachys nigra f. simadake, commonly known as the black bamboo or ink bamboo, is a variant of the black bamboo species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that have a glossy, almost metallic sheen. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows in dense, upright clusters, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the dark stems. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a decorative plant in traditional Chinese landscapes."
