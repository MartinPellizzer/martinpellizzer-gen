    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. varbossania, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the bark is dark and fissured. This species is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental value, though its berries are toxic to humans and livestock."
