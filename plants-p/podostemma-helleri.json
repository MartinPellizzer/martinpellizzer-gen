    "intro": "Podostemma helleri, commonly known as Heller's podostem, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It thrives in fast-flowing streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks using its specialized roots. The plant has small, delicate leaves that are typically submerged, while its flowers are short-lived and often appear above the water surface. Podostemma helleri is characterized by its unique morphology, with elongated stems and tiny, clustered flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
