    "intro": "Placea pratensis, commonly known as meadow cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Placea pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
