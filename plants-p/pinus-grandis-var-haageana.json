    "intro": "Pinus grandis var. haageana, commonly known as the Haage's pine, is a rare and unique variant of the grand fir. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive needle-like leaves that are longer than those of typical fir species. The cones of this plant are typically conical and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
