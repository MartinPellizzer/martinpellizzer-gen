    "intro": "Pleione rhombilabia, commonly known as the rhomboid pleione, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several pale yellow to orange flowers that have a distinctive rhomboid shape. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
