    "intro": "Pentacalia perijaensis, commonly known as the Perijan starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, bell-shaped blooms during the spring and summer seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
