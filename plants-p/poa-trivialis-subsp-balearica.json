It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and coastal dunes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and supporting local insect populations."
