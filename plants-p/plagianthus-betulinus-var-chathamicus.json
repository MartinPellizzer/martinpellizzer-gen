    "intro": "Plagianthus betulinus var. chathamicus, commonly known as the Chatham Islands flax, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its strap-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive, fibrous root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
