It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
