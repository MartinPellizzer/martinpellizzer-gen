    "intro": "Paeonia \u00d7 suffruticosa var. papaveracea, commonly known as the Persian peony, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant features compound, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance. Its botanical structure includes a thick, woody stem with a fibrous root system, typical of many herbaceous perennials. The flowers are borne on long pedicels and are composed of both showy petals and numerous stamens, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
