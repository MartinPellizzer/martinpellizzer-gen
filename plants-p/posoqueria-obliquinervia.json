    "intro": "Posoqueria obliquinervia, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered, leathery, and often dimorphic fronds. Its leaves are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern, which helps in maximizing light absorption in its natural habitat.
