    "intro": "Psychotria papillosa, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though it is not as widely studied as other species in the Psychotria genus."
