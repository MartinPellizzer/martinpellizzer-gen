    "intro": "Petalidium cymbiforme, commonly known as the flat-leaved petalidium, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
