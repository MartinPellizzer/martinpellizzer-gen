    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris yigongensis, commonly known as the Yigong fern, is a rare and unique species of fern found primarily in the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive frond morphology, which includes a short, erect rachis and lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically at high altitudes where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the pinnae, a feature common among many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudophegopteris yigongensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
