    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris subsp. surrecta, commonly known as upright deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often rise above the surrounding vegetation. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or blue, typically arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in woodland edges."
