It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, intricate flowers. The plant typically produces dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
