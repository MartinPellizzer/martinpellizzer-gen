    "intro": "Pinus insignis var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth bark pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-bark trunk and slender, often pendulous branches. The leaves are needle-like, typically growing in clusters of five, and they are a vibrant green in color. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters."
