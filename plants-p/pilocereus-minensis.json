    "intro": "Pilocereus minensis, commonly known as the yellow night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming habit, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens."
