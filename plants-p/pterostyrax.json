    "intro": "Pterostyrax, commonly known as the sweet-scented pterostyrax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pentaphylacaceae. These plants are characterized by their fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving off a pleasant aroma. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Pterostyrax species are native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and they often grow in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and aromatic foliage."
