    "intro": "Phegopteris tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly underside on the fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a complex venation pattern. Phegopteris tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its rocky habitat and is often found in alpine or subalpine ecosystems."
