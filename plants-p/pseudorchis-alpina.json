It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain environments. Pseudorchis alpina is often found in open, rocky areas and is considered a rare and specialized species."
