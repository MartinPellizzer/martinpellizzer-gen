    "intro": "Paronychia microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry conditions. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
