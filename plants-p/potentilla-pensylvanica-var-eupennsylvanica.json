    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. eupennsylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features compound leaves with five leaflets that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Potentilla pensylvanica."
