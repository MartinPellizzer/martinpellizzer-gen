    "intro": "Pinguicula elongata, commonly known as the elongated butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in boggy areas or along stream banks. Its unique ability to capture prey through adhesive secretions is a key feature of its botanical adaptation."
