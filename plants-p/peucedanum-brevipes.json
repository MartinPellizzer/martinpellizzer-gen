    "intro": "Peucedanum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed angelica, is a flowering plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant features slender, branched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves with a mild, aromatic odor. Its small white to yellowish flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
