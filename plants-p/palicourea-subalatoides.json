    "intro": "Palicourea subalatoides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
