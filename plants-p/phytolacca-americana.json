    "intro": "Phytolacca americana, commonly known as American pokeweed, is a tall, erect herbaceous plant native to North America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including phytolaccatoxin, which can cause severe illness if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically in traditional medicine for various purposes."
