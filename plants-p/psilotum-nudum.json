    "intro": "Psilotum nudum, commonly known as the horse tail or whisk fern, is a unique vascular plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It belongs to the order Psilotales and is characterized by its simple, branching structure composed of sporophylls and fertile shoots. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of its branches, producing spores rather than seeds. Psilotum nudum is considered a primitive plant, offering insights into the evolutionary history of vascular plants."
