    "intro": "Porochna hiernii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf porochna, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as along roadsides or in gravelly areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
