    "intro": "Pterocarpus negrensis, commonly known as the Negros ebony, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a legume that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its timber but is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
