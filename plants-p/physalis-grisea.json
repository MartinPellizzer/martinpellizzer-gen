    "intro": "Physalis grisea, commonly known as the gray gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow to orange berry that turns red when ripe, often containing several seeds. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for gardens and naturalized areas."
