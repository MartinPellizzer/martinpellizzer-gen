    "intro": "Peperomia theodori, commonly known as the Theodore's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Its foliage is succulent, allowing it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
