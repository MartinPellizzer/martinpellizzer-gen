    "intro": "Pyrethrum conicum, commonly known as the conical pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive conical or spiky flower heads, which are composed of dense clusters of small, yellowish-white florets. The plant produces a fine, powdery substance called pyrethrum, which contains natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds are effective against a wide range of pests, making the plant valuable in organic pest control. Pyrethrum conicum typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
