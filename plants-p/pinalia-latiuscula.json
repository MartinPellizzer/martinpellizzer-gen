    "intro": "Pinalia latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pinyon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for both wildlife and indigenous peoples. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Pinalia latiuscula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species."
