    "intro": "Phyllorkis membranacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
