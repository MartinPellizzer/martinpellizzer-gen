    "intro": "Pisum ochrus, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
