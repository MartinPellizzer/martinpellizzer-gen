    "intro": "Pyrus zeto, commonly known as the Zetos pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to parts of Central Asia and is characterized by its deciduous nature and ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible pears that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Pyrus zeto is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and mild-flavored fruit, though it is less commonly grown than other pear species."
