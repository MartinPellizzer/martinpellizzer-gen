    "intro": "Pleopeltis murorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, typical of ferns. Pleopeltis murorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
