    "intro": "Pteropodium, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle. The plant-like appearance of some species has led to its alternative name, though it is not a true plant but an invertebrate. Pteropodiums are typically found in warm, shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a mucus-like substance. These organisms play an important role in marine ecosystems as both prey and predators."
