It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display white, yellow, and green patterns, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or black cherries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively low maintenance once established. Its unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
