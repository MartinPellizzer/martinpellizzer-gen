    "intro": "Prunus myrtifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a slight reflexed (curled backward) margin, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in coastal and urban landscapes. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its use in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
