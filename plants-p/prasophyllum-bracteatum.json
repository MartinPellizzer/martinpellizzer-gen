    "intro": "Prasophyllum bracteatum, commonly known as the bractless orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy, greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in heathland or open forest environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that produces a basal rosette of leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Prasophyllum bracteatum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and birds."
