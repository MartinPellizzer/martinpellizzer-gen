    "intro": "Phoebe falcata, commonly known as the Florida beech, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet and has smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptical, often with a distinctive falcate (sickle-shaped) tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
