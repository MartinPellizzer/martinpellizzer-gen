    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or wet meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many regions."
