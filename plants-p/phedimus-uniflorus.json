    "intro": "Phedimus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Phedimus uniflorus is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
