    "intro": "Penstemon buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Buckley's beardtongue is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
