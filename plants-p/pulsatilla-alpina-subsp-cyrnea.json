    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina subsp. cyrnea, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces follicles that contain the seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and Carpathians."
