    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. nobilis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or sakura, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly the showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus serrulata, resulting in a variety with enhanced floral display and improved cold hardiness. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and the fruit is a small, dark red drupe that follows the flowering period."
