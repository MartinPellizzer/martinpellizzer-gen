    "intro": "Paspalum hirtum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Paspalum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
