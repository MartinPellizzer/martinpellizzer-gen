    "intro": "Polypodium floccigerum, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium floccigerum is often found in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
