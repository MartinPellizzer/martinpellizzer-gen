    "intro": "Pyrethrum sosnowskyanum, commonly known as Sosnowsky's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic pesticides. Pyrethrum sosnowskyanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in sustainable pest control."
