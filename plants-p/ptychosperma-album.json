    "intro": "Ptychosperma album, commonly known as the white cycad, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their pale, waxy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
