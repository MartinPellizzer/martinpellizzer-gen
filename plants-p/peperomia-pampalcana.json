It features thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an appealing addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
