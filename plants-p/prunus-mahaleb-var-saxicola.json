    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola cherry, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, dark red flowers that appear in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. The plant has a dense, upright growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a specimen plant due to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for temperate climates. Its foliage turns a vibrant orange-red in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
