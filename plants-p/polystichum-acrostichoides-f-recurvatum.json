    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved swamp fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, low-growing mat. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments with high humidity and partial shade."
