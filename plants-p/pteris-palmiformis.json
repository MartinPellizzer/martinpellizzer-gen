    "intro": "Pteris palmiformis, commonly known as the palm-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmately divided fronds that resemble the shape of a palm tree, giving it its common name. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Pteris palmiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions."
