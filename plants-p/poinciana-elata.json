    "intro": "Poinciana elata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which appear in clusters during the flowering season. The plant has a dense, rounded canopy and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray."
