    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-scale black pine, is a variant of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, overlapping scales on the cones and its relatively fast growth rate compared to other pine species. The tree typically reaches heights of 15 to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. Its needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in bundles of five, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
