It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces elongated, woody fruits that encase the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including selenium and healthy fats. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
