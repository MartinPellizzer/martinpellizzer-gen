    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum, commonly known as bracken, is a widely distributed fern species found in temperate regions around the world. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in areas with high moisture levels. Its rhizome system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in many ecosystems. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, which can be observed at night."
