    "intro": "Phacelia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phacelia menziesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
