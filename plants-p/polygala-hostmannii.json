    "intro": "Polygala hostmannii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves and produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
