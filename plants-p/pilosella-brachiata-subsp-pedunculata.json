It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The subspecies pedunculata is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support the flowering heads."
