It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a rounded or irregular shape. Its leaves are oval to elliptical, with a coarse texture and a grayish-green hue. The flowers are usually pale pink or white, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully develop."
