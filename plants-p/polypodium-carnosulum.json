    "intro": "Polypodium carnosulum, commonly known as the beefsteak fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often used as a decorative element in horticulture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
