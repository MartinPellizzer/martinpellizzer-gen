It is characterized by its tall, fibrous trunk and large, paddle-shaped leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes at the top of the plant. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its roots can be used in herbal remedies. The species is adapted to coastal and lowland environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
