    "intro": "Phalaenopsis violacea var. murtoniana, commonly known as the Murton's orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, violet-colored flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and can last for several months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
