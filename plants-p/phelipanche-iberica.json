    "intro": "Phelipanche iberica, commonly known as the Iberian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It is known to parasitize various agricultural crops, making it a significant weed in farmlands. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to host roots through specialized structures called haustoria."
