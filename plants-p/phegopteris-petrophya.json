    "intro": "Phegopteris petrophya, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of its leaves. Phegopteris petrophya plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude environment."
