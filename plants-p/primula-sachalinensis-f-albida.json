    "intro": "Primula sachalinensis f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primula genus native to the Korean Peninsula. This plant is characterized by its pale to fully white petals, which contrast with its typically pink or purple-flowered relatives. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas with partial shade. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural circles."
