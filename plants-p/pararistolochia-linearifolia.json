It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a slender, ribbed follicle that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a potentially harmful plant in its natural habitat."
