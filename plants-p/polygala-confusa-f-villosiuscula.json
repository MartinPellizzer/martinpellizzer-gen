It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to regions of China and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
