    "intro": "Panicum eburneum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and erect, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable species for erosion control. Silver bluestem is also appreciated for its ornamental value and role in wildlife habitat."
