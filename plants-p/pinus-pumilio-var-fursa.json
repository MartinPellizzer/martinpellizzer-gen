    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. fursa, commonly known as the alpine dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Its needle-like leaves are typically gray-green in color and remain on the plant for several years before shedding. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, thriving in rocky soils and high elevation areas."
