    "intro": "Pedicularis brachyodonta subsp. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi's short-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are often reduced or scale-like, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stems and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the species."
