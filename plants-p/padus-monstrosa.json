    "intro": "Padus monstrosa, commonly known as the monstrous bird cherry, is a species of shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted branches and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red drupes that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge. While not widely cultivated, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance."
