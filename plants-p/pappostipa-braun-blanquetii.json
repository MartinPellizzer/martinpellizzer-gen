    "intro": "Pappostipa braun-blanquetii, commonly known as the Braun-Blanquet's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically arranged in a panicle shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
