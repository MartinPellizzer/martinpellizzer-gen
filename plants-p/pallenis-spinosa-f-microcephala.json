    "intro": "Pallenis spinosa f. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf spinous pallenis, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its small, rounded leaves and spiny stems. It is a horticultural form of the species Pallenis spinosa, which is native to southern Africa. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique morphology, including its reduced leaf size and dense, thorny structure, contributes to its ornamental value. This form is often cultivated for its resilience and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
