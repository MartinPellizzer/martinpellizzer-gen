    "intro": "Paepalanthus squamilifer, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to grayish-white hairs, which provide insulation and protection against intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
