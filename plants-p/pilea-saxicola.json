    "intro": "Pilea saxicola, commonly known as the rock pilea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white, which bloom in the spring. Pilea saxicola is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
