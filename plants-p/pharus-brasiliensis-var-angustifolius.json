It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
