    "intro": "Psoralea altissima, commonly known as the tall psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces legume pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Psoralea altissima is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
