    "intro": "Peperomia prolifera, commonly known as the baby rubber plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense clusters through the growth of adventitious roots and shoots, making it an attractive and easy-to-maintain houseplant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
