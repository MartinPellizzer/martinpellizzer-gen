    "intro": "Petasites frigidus subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, cool environments such as mountain meadows and tundra, often growing in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
