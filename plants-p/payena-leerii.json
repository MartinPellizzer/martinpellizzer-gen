    "intro": "Payena leerii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, leathery fruits containing a single seed. Payena leerii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, although it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting. Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
