    "intro": "Piliostigma enigmaticum, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered an enigmatic species within its genus."
