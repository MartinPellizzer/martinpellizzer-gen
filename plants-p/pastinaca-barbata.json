It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its seed pods are spiny and contain numerous small seeds. The hairy bur marigold is often found in disturbed wetlands and is considered an indicator species for such habitats."
