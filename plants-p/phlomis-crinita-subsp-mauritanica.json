    "intro": "Phlomis crinita subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian beardgrass, is a perennial herb native to North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flower heads in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
