    "intro": "Pseudoprosopis claessensii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves that are often mistaken for willow leaves, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
