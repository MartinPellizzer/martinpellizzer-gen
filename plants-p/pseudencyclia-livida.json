    "intro": "Pseudencyclia livida, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudencyclia livida is considered endangered and faces significant threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
