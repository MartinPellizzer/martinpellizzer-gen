It features narrow, upright leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their soothing effects on the skin and respiratory system."
