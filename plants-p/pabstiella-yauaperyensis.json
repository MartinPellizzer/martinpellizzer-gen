    "intro": "Pabstiella yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 rock cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a small, leafless cactus that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on steep slopes or cliffs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable."
