    "intro": "Pilea lucens var. minor, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or simply the dollar plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, glossy, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, green berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. The variety 'minor' is noted for its smaller size compared to the standard Pilea lucens, making it ideal for tabletop displays."
