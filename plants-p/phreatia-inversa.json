    "intro": "Phreatia inversa, commonly known as the inverted phreatia, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its flowers facing downward, which is an adaptation to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers, which are usually pale green or yellowish, are relatively small but possess a distinctive fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
