    "intro": "Pedilochilus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine pedilochilus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
