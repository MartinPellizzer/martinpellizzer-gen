    "intro": "Phlox subulata f. australis, commonly known as the Australian stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with needle-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to both garden and landscape designs."
