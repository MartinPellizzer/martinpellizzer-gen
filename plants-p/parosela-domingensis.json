    "intro": "Parosela domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
