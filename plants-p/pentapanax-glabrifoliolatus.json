    "intro": "Pentapanax glabrifoliolatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved five-leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
