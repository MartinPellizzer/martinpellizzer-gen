It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in many individuals. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils. Physalastrum urticifolium has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
