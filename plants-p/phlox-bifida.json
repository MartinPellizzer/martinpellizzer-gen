    "intro": "Phlox bifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf phlox, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds through the wind. Phlox bifida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
