It features tall, slender stems with a fountain-like growth habit, producing fluffy, silver-gray plumes that add visual interest. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, and its flowers appear in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract wildlife further enhance its appeal in both ornamental and ecological settings."
