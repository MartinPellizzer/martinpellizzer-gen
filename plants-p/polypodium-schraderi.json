    "intro": "Polypodium schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium schraderi plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
