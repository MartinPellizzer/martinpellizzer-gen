    "intro": "Phymatopteris oxyloba, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense clusters on rocky outcrops. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The rock fern plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance."
