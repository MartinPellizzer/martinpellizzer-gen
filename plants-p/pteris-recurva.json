    "intro": "Pteris recurva, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, Pteris recurva thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
