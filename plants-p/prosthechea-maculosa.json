It is characterized by its short, erect stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Prosthechea maculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
