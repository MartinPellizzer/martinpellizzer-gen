    "intro": "Parvisedum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf parvisedum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
