    "intro": "Pseudodrynaria coronans, commonly known as the tree fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant's trunk is composed of a central axis surrounded by a mass of rhizomes, which store nutrients and water. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators. Pseudodrynaria coronans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
