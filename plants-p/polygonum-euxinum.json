It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near water bodies such as lakes and marshes. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late summer. Polygonum euxinum is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
