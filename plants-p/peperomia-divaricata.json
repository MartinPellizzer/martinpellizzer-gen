    "intro": "Peperomia divaricata, commonly known as the Shiny Leaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a glossy green surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of green or red, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or low-light spaces."
