It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense stands in shallow water. Phaca reedii is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
