    "intro": "Potentilla saxosa, commonly known as saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stems that produce basal leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
