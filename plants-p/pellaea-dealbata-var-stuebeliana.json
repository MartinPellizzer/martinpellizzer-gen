    "intro": "Pellaea dealbata var. stuebeliana, commonly known as the Stuebel's cliffbrake, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
