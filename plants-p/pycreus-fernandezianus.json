    "intro": "Pycreus fernandezianus, commonly known as the Fernandezian fern, is a species of fern native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
