    "intro": "Pteretis nodulosa f. foliacea, commonly known as the nodular pteretis, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit. It features delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive nodular appearance along the rachis, giving it a textured, almost coral-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural collections."
