    "intro": "Populus nigra var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant black poplar, is a large, fast-growing tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and can reach up to 15 cm in length. The tree produces showy, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow to heights of over 30 meters. This variety is often found near watercourses and is valued for its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
