    "intro": "Polygonum meisnerianum var. setosum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by wind and animals."
