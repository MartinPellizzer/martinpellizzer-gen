    "intro": "Pterostylis depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of pale green to white flowers. The flowers are highly modified, with a labellum that is often reduced or absent, typical of many orchids in the genus Pterostylis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. The plant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species in its native range."
