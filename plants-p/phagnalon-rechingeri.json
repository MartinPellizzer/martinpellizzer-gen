    "intro": "Phagnalon rechingeri, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Phagnalon rechingeri is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
