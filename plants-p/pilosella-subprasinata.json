    "intro": "Pilosella subprasinata, commonly known as the green-haired mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
