    "intro": "Pavonia gracilis, commonly known as the slender poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers, surrounding small yellow true flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pavonia gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
