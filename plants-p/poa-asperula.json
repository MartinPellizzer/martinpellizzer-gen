    "intro": "Poa asperula, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
