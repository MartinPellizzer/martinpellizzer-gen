    "intro": "Pothos hellwigii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length, giving it a lush, foliage-heavy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental leaves rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant. Its adaptability to various indoor conditions contributes to its widespread cultivation."
