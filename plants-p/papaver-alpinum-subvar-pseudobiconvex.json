    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. pseudobiconvex, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are cup-shaped with a distinctive, spurred petal that aids in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
