    "intro": "Psychrogeton cabulicum, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant features a fibrous root system and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. Psychrogeton cabulicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
