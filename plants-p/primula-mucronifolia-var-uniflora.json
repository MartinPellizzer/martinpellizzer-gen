    "intro": "Primula mucronifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered primrose, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces compact rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and bears a single, showy flower at the center of each stem. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a distinctive, spurred corolla that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
