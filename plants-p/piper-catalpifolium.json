    "intro": "Piper catalpifolium, commonly known as the catalpa-leaved pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which resemble those of the catalpa tree, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are three-lobed berries that contain seeds. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
