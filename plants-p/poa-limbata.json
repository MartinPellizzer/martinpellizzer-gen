    "intro": "Poa limbata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Poa limbata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
