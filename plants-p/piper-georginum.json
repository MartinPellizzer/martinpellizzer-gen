    "intro": "Piper georginum, commonly known as the George's pepper or the pink pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that develop into peppercorns. These peppercorns are harvested and used as a spice, though they are not as commonly used as black or white pepper. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its aromatic fruits."
