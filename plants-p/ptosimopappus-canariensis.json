It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, herbaceous stems and dense, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
