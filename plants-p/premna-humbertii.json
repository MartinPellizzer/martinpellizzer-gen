It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
