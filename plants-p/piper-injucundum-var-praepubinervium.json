    "intro": "Piper injucundum var. praepubinervium, commonly known as the red-veined pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive red veins on the undersides of its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and horticultural research."
