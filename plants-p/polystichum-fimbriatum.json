    "intro": "Polystichum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a tall, upright rhizome from which feather-like fronds emerge, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely toothed margins that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
