    "intro": "Phoradendron constrictum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, evergreen foliage that often creates a spherical shape on the host tree. It has small, white or pale green leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries. The berries are an important food source for birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees."
