    "intro": "Passovia pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Passovia pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
