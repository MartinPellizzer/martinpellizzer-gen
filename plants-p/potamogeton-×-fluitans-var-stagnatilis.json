    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 fluitans var. stagnatilis, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the lower portion submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via stolons that root at the nodes. Its presence can influence water quality and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
