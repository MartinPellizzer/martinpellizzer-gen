    "intro": "Pinus eldarica, commonly known as the Eldarica pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. Its cones are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is relatively slow-growing."
