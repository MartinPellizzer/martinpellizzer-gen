It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
