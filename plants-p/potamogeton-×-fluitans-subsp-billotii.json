    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 fluitans subsp. billotii, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its submerged or floating leaves. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length, and its leaves are often ribbon-like in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water's surface. This subspecies is known for its ability to form dense vegetation, which can impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
