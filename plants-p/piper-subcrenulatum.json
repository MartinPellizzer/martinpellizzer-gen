It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically borne in clusters, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in some traditional cuisines. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
