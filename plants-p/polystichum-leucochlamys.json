    "intro": "Polystichum leucochlamys, commonly known as the white-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as an indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
