    "intro": "Poa rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Rivas-Martinez bentgrass, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa rivas-martinezii is considered a species of conservation concern."
