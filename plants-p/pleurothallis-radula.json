    "intro": "Pleurothallis radula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, strap-like leaves that help it cling to tree branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
