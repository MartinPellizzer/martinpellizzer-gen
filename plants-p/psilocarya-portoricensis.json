    "intro": "Psilocarya portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican psychedelic mushroom, is a species of hallucinogenic fungus native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the genus Psilocybe, which includes several species known for containing the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. The fruiting bodies of this mushroom typically appear as small, clustered caps with a distinctive yellowish to brownish coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with decaying organic matter. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest to both mycologists and those studying the effects of hallucinogenic substances."
