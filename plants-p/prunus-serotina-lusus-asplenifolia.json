    "intro": "Prunus serotina lusus asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate black cherry, is a variant of the black cherry tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, asplenifoliate leaves that resemble those of the fern *Asplenium*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and genetic variation."
