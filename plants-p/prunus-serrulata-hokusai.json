    "intro": "Prunus serrulata hokusai, commonly known as the Hokusai cherry, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree (Prunus serrulata). It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins and clusters of delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a rounded or spreading crown. Its ornamental value lies in its graceful form and the striking contrast between its foliage and blossoms. This cultivar is often planted in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal beauty."
