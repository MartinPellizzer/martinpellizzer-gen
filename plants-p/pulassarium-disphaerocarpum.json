    "intro": "Pulassarium disphaerocarpum, commonly known as the giant waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, spirally arranged leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a dense, floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant's unique structure resembles a waterwheel, with its whorled leaves creating a visually dramatic appearance. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its botanical features make it both an ecological indicator species and a subject of interest in botanical research."
