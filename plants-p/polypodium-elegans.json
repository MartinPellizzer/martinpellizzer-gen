    "intro": "Polypodium elegans, commonly known as the delicate fern or the elegant water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Polypodium elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
