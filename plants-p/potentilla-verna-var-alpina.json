    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. alpina, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, lobed leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
