    "intro": "Platythelys sagrana, commonly known as the sagrana orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
