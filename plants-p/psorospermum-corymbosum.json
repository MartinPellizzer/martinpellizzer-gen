    "intro": "Psorospermum corymbosum, commonly known as the silky mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it a key species in mangrove forests."
