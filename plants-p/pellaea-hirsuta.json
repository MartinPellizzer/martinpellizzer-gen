    "intro": "Pellaea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, leathery fronds that give it its common name. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on cliffs or in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
