    "intro": "Paspalum pressum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Paspalum pressum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
