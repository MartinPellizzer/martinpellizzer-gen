    "intro": "Plagioscyphus nudicalyx, commonly known as the naked-stalked sun\u5e3d, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a short, unbranched stem that supports a single, large, palmate leaf. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cyathium, a typical structure for the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
