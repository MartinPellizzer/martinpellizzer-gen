    "intro": "Pithecellobium glomeriflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flower acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences of small, yellowish flowers, which are often arranged in racemes. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of elliptic leaflets, and it produces elongated, flat pods that contain edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides or in dry forests, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
