    "intro": "Pelargonium verbenifolium, commonly known as the Mexican geranium, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early autumn."
