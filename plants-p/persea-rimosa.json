    "intro": "Persea rimosa, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible when fully ripe, though they can be astringent if harvested too early. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, rounded form. Persea rimosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit in suitable climates."
