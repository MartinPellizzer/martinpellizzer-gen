    "intro": "Poa keysseri var. saruwagetica, commonly known as the Saruwagetica bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear slender, two-ranked spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
