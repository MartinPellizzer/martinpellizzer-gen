    "intro": "Pinus teocote subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and ancient subspecies native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth, twisted trunk, and thick, scaly bark that provides resistance to fire and drought. The tree produces large, edible pine cones that contain winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This subspecies is notable for its longevity and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
