    "intro": "Paspalum usterii var. villosum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
