    "intro": "Polygala calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Polygala calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
