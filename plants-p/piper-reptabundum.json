    "intro": "Piper reptabundum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its trailing habit, with slender stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or up supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, and often have a glossy surface. The small greenish-white flowers are followed by elongated, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature."
