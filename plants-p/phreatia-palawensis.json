    "intro": "Phreatia palawensis, commonly known as the Palau sky orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of the Philippines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant features a short, stocky stem with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its often moist but nutrient-poor habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
