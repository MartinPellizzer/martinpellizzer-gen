    "intro": "Pityranthe trichosperma, commonly known as the hairy pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences composed of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dry fruits known as utricles, which contain seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Pityranthe trichosperma is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
