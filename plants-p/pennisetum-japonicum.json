    "intro": "Pennisetum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Japan and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Pennisetum japonicum is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
