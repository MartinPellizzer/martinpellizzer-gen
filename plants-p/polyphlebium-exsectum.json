It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in structure and appearance."
