    "intro": "Padus virginiana, commonly known as white cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its gray-barked trunk and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, stream banks, and forest edges. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
