    "intro": "Panicum scabrifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, fluffy spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
