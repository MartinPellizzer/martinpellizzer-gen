    "intro": "Paspalum gardnerianum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its adaptability to moist conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
