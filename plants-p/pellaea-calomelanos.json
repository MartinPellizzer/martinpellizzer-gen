    "intro": "Pellaea calomelanos, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, leathery fronds that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Pellaea calomelanos is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
