    "intro": "Pernettya halliana, commonly known as the Hall's cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Pernettya halliana thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and boreal ecosystems."
