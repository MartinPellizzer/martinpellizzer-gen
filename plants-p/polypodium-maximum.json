    "intro": "Polypodium maximum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other fern species."
