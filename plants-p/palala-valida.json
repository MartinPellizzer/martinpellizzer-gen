    "intro": "Palala valida, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Palala valida is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
