    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. reichenbachiana, commonly known as the Reichenbach's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and yellowish, with a distinctive spurred shape. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
