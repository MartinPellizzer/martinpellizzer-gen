    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia concava subsp. clinostyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pseudotrimezia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understoreys, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental change."
