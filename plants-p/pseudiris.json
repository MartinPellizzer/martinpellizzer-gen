    "intro": "Pseudiris, commonly known as the false iris, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features showy, iris-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. Pseudiris species are typically herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves and are often used in rock gardens due to their hardiness. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in early spring."
