    "intro": "Primula tzetsouensis, commonly known as the Tzetsou primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture.
