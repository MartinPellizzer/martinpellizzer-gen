    "intro": "Plantago major f. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly wavy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, along paths, and in urban environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. This variety is closely related to other Plantago species and is well adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
