    "intro": "Pyrrocoma eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly pygmy cactus, is a small, succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense, hairy coating that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with multiple short stems that may branch out. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
