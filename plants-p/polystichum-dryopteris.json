It features tall, upright fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped base, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a glossy appearance that enhances its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
