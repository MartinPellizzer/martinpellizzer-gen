    "intro": "Pyrethrum shepardii, commonly known as the shepard's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pyrethrum shepardii is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
