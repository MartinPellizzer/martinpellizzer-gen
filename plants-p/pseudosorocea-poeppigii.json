    "intro": "Pseudosorocea poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, fleshy leaves that are usually clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for dispersal. Pseudosorocea poeppigii is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
