    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
