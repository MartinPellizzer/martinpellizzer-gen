    "intro": "Pteropyrum griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir saffron or red sanders, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Himalayas. It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments at high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws."
