    "intro": "Pseudobromus, commonly known as the false brome, is a genus of grasses native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. They typically thrive in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats. Pseudobromus species are generally drought-tolerant and have a fibrous root system that helps them survive in arid conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that contribute to their ornamental appeal."
