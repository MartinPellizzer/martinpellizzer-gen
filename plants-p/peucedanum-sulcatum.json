    "intro": "Peucedanum sulcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its roots are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is important to note that some species of Peucedanum can be toxic, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
