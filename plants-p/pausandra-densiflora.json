    "intro": "Pausandra densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower pipsissewa, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. Pausandra densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
