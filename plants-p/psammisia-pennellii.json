    "intro": "Psammisia pennellii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often opening in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are wiry and sprawling. Psammisia pennellii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in drought-tolerant gardens."
