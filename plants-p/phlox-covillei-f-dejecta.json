    "intro": "Phlox covillei f. dejecta, commonly known as the low-growing phlox, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to lavender, blooming in early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping."
