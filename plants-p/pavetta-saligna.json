It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Pavetta saligna is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
