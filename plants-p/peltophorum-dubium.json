    "intro": "Peltophorum dubium, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree,\" is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The tree produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody pods containing fluffy, cotton-like seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
