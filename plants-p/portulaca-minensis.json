    "intro": "Portulaca minensis, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Portulaca minensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
