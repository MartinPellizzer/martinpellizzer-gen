    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria dshinalica, commonly known as the Dshinali grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute grains, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
