    "intro": "Piper salticola, commonly known as the jumping cucumber, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cucumber-like fruits. The fruits are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, often used in local cuisines. Its common name stems from the way the fruits can bounce or \"jump\" when dropped due to their hollow, fibrous structure."
