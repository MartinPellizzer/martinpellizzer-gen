    "intro": "Pyrola monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. The plant produces showy white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to thrive in cool, moist, acidic soils. Pyrola monophylla is often found in shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
