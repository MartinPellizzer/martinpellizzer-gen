    "intro": "Parastemon, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Parastemon species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to the plant's drought-resistant adaptations."
