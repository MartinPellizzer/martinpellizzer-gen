    "intro": "Polygala umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy milkwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Polygala umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
