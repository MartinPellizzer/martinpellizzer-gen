    "intro": "Phreatia goodspeediana, commonly known as the Goodspeed's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
