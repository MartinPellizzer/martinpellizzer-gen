    "intro": "Poikilospermum nobile, commonly known as the noble poikilospermum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are notable for their variable size and shape, a feature that gives the genus its name. Poikilospermum nobile is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodland or grassland habitats."
