    "intro": "Pilosocereus polygonus subsp. curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
