    "intro": "Pleiogyne villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Pleiogyne villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
