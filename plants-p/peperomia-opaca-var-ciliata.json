    "intro": "Peperomia opaca var. ciliata, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The leaves often have ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
