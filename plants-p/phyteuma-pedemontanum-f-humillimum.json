    "intro": "Phyteuma pedemontanum f. humillimum, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet-blue or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
