    "intro": "Polypodium meyi, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium meyi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
