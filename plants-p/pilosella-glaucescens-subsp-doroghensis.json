    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. doroghensis, commonly known as the Hungarian blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
