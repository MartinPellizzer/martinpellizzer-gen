    "intro": "Poa carpatica subsp. supramontana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in alpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to golden in color. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
