    "intro": "Polypodium keraudrenianum, commonly known as the Keraudren's fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
