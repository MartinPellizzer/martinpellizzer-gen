It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has small, narrow leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
