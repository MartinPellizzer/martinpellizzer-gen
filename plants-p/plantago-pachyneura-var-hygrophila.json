    "intro": "Plantago pachyneura var. hygrophila, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged soils across its native range."
