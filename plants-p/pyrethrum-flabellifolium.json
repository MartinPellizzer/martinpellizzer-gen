    "intro": "Pyrethrum flabellifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Pyrethrum flabellifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of pyrethrins, which are used in organic pest control. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
