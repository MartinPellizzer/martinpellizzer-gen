    "intro": "Panicum verruciferum, commonly known as the woolly bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to silver flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Panicum verruciferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
