    "intro": "Paris polyphylla var. taitungensis, commonly known as the Taitung peacock fern, is a rare variant of the Paris polyphylla species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its striking, fern-like leaves that display a vibrant array of colors, including shades of green, red, and purple. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
