It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
