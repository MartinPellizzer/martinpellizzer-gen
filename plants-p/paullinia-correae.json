    "intro": "Paullinia correae, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in certain regions outside its native habitat."
