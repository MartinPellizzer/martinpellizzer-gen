    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features upright, woody stems covered in dense, silvery-gray hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
