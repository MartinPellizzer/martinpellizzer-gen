    "intro": "Pinellia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Pinellia cordata is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other wet areas where it thrives in humid conditions."
