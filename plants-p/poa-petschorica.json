    "intro": "Poa petschorica, commonly known as the Siberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Poa petschorica plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
