    "intro": "Phymatopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This resilient fern is well adapted to harsh conditions and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
