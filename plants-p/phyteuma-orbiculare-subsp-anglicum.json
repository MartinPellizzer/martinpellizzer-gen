    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare subsp. anglicum, commonly known as English globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern England and parts of France. It is characterized by its rounded, orbicular leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
