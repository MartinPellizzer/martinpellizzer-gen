    "intro": "Paspalum planum, commonly known as flatgrass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum planum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
