    "intro": "Phegopteris procera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water. Phegopteris procera is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
