    "intro": "Phoradendron aureum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically elliptical in shape. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird populations."
