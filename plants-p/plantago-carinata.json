    "intro": "Plantago carinata, commonly known as the curled dock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often curled at the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike that rises from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
