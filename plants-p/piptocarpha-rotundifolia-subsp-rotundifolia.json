It is a perennial herb characterized by its woolly, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic members."
