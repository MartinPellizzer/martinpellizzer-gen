    "intro": "Pachypodium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead pachypodium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spiny, branching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically small and may be absent in mature plants, giving it a unique, tree-like structure. Pachypodium sagittatum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
