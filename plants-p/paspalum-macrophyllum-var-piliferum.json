    "intro": "Paspalum macrophyllum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in moist environments."
