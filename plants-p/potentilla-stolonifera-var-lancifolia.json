    "intro": "Potentilla stolonifera var. lancifolia, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features slender, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in corymbs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites."
