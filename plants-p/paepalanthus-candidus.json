    "intro": "Paepalanthus candidus, commonly known as the white-barked peacock flower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. However, it is considered rare and is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its specific ecological requirements."
