    "intro": "Potentilla exigua, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats. Potentilla exigua is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
