    "intro": "Pistolochia boissieri, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
