    "intro": "Phymatopsis trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed phymatopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
