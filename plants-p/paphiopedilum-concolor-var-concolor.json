It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that is typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the spring or early summer. The plant prefers partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
