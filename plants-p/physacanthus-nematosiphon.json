It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
