    "intro": "Pinus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically 5 to 9 centimeters in length, arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is extensive, helping to prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat. The longleaf pine is also notable for its ability to thrive in fire-prone ecosystems, where it has developed adaptations to survive periodic wildfires."
