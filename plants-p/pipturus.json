These plants are characterized by their dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in acidic soils and shaded environments. Pipturus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their evergreen foliage. The genus includes several species, such as Pipturus arborescens, which is native to North America."
