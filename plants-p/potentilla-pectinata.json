    "intro": "Potentilla pectinata, commonly known as the meadow cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Potentilla pectinata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
