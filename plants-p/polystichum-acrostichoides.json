    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides, commonly known as the Atlantic shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
