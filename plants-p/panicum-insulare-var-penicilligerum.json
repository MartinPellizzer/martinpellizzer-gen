    "intro": "Panicum insulare var. penicilligerum, commonly known as the island panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
