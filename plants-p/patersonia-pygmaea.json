It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Patersonia pygmaea is often found in grasslands and open forests, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
