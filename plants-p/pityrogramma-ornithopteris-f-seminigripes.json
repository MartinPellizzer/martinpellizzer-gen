    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris f. seminigripes, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, elongated shape that distinguishes this fern from closely related species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
