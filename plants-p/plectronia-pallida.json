    "intro": "Plectronia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and its low reproductive rate, Plectronia pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
