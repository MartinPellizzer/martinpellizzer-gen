    "intro": "Pronephrium hosei, commonly known as the Philippine fern, is a species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in anchoring the plant to rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
