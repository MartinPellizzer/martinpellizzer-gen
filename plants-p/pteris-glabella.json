    "intro": "Pteris glabella, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other ferns. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Pteris glabella thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
