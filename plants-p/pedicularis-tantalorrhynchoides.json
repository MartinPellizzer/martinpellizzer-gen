    "intro": "Pedicularis tantalorrhynchoides, commonly known as the golden root, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
