    "intro": "Portulaca eriophora, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning and close during the heat of the day. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Portulaca eriophora is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
