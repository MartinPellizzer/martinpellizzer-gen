It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with white markings, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable addition to botanical collections."
