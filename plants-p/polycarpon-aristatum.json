    "intro": "Polycarpon aristatum, commonly known as the spiked speedwell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
