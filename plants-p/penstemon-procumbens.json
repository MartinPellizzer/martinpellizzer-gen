    "intro": "Penstemon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping beardtongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting well to rocky and arid environments. Penstemon procumbens is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
