    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 izuense, commonly known as the Izu fern, is a hybrid species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. Native to Japan, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
