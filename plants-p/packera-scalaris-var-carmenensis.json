    "intro": "Packera scalaris var. carmenensis, commonly known as Carmen's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its bright yellow flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
