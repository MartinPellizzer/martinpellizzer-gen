It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a cascading effect. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to cherries. Botanically, it is a deciduous shrub or small tree with simple, oval leaves and a compact growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
