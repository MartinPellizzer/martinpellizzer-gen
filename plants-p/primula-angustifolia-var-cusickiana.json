    "intro": "Primula angustifolia var. cusickiana, commonly known as the Cusick's narrowleaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit, adding color to gardens before many other flowers emerge."
