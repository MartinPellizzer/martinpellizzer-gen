    "intro": "Pilosella rothiana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a soft, cushion-like appearance. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Pilosella rothiana is often found in meadows and open slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
