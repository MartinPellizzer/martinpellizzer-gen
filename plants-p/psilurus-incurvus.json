    "intro": "Psilurus incurvus, commonly known as the curved-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that curve inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Psilurus incurvus is relatively small in stature, with fronds usually not exceeding 30 centimeters in length."
