    "intro": "Panicum urvilleanum var. longiglume, commonly known as the long-awned bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive, elongated glumes that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in full sun and is often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands and prairies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
