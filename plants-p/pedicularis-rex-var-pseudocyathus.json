    "intro": "Pedicularis rex var. pseudocyathus, commonly known as the royal monkey orchid, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a rare and protected species in many regions."
