    "intro": "Pyrus roborowskii, commonly known as the Siberian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and ovate, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for temperate climates. Pyrus roborowskii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
