    "intro": "Pteris mutilata, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that create a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris mutilata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
