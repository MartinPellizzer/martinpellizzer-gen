    "intro": "Paphiopedilum barbigerum var. coccineum, commonly known as the Crimson-lipped Paphiopedilum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, lip-shaped petals that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant produces pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
