    "intro": "Prunus serrulata geraldinae, commonly known as the Geraldina cherry, is a rare and ornamental species native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, dark red fruits in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical gardens."
