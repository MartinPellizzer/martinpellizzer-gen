It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically dark green with a reddish tint on the underside, giving it a striking appearance. Parapolystichum rufescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
