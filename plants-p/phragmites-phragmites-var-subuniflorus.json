    "intro": "Phragmites phragmites var. subuniflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces fluffy, white plumes that are characteristic of the genus Phragmites. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common and sometimes invasive species in wetland ecosystems."
