    "intro": "Polypodium gramineum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Polypodium gramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
