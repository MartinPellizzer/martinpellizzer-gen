It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to yellow flowers, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Yellow panicgrass is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a forage crop for livestock."
