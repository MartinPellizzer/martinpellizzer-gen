It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
