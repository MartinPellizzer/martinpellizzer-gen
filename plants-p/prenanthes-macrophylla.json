    "intro": "Prenanthes macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf waterparsley, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers, while small, play a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as insects and amphibians."
