    "intro": "Polystichum cristatum, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, erect fronds that are often adorned with a unique, crested or wavy pattern along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Polystichum cristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
