    "intro": "Polystichum foeniculaceum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of Korea. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are edible and often used in traditional Asian cuisine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The fern's rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
