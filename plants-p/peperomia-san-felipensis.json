It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are borne on short, erect spikes. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its unique foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for container gardening and as a decorative houseplant."
