    "intro": "Pteris platysora, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris platysora is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
