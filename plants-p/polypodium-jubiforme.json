    "intro": "Polypodium jubiforme, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden or rusty-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are a key feature in its reproductive cycle."
