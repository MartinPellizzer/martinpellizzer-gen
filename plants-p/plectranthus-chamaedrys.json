    "intro": "Plectranthus chamaedrys, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and ability to spread rapidly make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes."
