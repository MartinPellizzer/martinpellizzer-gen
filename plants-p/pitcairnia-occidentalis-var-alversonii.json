    "intro": "Pitcairnia occidentalis var. alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spathaceous inflorescence that displays vibrant red and orange hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
