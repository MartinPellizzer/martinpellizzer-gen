    "intro": "Polypogon pygmeus, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the nodes along the stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its compact size and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
