    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. floribunda, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit with multiple stems and showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
