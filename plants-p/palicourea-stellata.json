    "intro": "Palicourea stellata, commonly known as starleaf palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Palicourea stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
