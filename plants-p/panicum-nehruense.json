    "intro": "Panicum nehruense, commonly known as the Nehru panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine hairs. Panicum nehruense is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
