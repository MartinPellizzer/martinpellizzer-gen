    "intro": "Poa morrisii, commonly known as the Morris' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, dark green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Poa morrisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
