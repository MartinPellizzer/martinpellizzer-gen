    "intro": "Phyllorkis maxillaris, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with strong sunlight and frequent frost. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
