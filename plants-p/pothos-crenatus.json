    "intro": "Pothos crenatus, commonly known as the jagged-leaf pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Pothos crenatus is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and ability to purify the air."
