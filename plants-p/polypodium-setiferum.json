    "intro": "Polypodium setiferum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium setiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
