    "intro": "Pinguicula mariae, commonly known as the Marie's butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive hood-shaped structure that protects the reproductive organs. Pinguicula mariae is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
