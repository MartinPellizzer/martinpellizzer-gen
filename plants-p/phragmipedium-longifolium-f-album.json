It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other Phragmipedium species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This cultivar is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
