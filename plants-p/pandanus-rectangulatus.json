    "intro": "Pandanus rectangulatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its leaves are fibrous and have been historically used for thatching and weaving. The species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in tropical environments."
