    "intro": "Prenanthes angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
