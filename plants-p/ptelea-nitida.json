    "intro": "Ptelea nitida, commonly known as silky ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark purple berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Ptelea nitida is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
