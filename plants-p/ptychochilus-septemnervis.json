    "intro": "Ptychochilus septemnervis, commonly known as the seven-veined orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
