    "intro": "Puya pearcei, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Puya pearcei produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
