It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, greyish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
