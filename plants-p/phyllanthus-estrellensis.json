    "intro": "Phyllanthus estrellensis, commonly known as Estrellan spurge, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
