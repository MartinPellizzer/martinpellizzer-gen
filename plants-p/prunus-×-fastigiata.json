    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 fastigiata, commonly known as the upright cherry or columnar cherry, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit, making it ideal for small spaces and formal gardens. The plant produces small, showy flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves turn a striking red or orange in autumn, adding seasonal interest. Prunus \u00d7 fastigiata is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
