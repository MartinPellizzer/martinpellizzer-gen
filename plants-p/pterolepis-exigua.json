    "intro": "Pterolepis exigua, commonly known as the slender pterolepis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and pine flatwoods. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common in its habitat. Pterolepis exigua is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
