    "intro": "Pteretis struthiopteris, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, ornamental fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, upright stem with large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, branched structure with fertile spore-bearing spikes at the tips of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic appearance. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in New Zealand's native flora."
