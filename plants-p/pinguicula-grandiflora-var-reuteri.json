    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora var. reuteri, commonly known as the Reuter's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare and specialized plant species."
