    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
