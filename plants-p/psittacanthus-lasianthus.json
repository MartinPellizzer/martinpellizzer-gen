    "intro": "Psittacanthus lasianthus, commonly known as the golden torch fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow fronds that resemble a torch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped leaflets. Psittacanthus lasianthus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
