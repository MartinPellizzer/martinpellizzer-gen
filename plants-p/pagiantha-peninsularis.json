    "intro": "Pagiantha peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular pagiantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the western coast of the Indian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with high humidity. Its blooming period occurs during the monsoon season, making it a short-lived but visually striking species. Due to habitat loss, Pagiantha peninsularis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
