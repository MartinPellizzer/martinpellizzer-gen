    "intro": "Platystele reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed platystele, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of flies, making it an important part of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, Platystele reflexa is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
