    "intro": "Passerina clementii, commonly known as the Clementii's pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring blooming habit. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with prominent sepals. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
