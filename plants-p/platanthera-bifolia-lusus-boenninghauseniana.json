    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia lusus boenninghauseniana, commonly known as the Boenninghausen's fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its ephemeral nature, often appearing only briefly before vanishing, which contributes to its mystique. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
