    "intro": "Panicum villosissimum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
