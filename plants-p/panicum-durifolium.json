    "intro": "Panicum durifolium, commonly known as stiffleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
