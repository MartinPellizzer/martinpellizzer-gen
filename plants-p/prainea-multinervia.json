It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often in forest understories. Prainea multinervia has simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
