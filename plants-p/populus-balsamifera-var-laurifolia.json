    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. laurifolia, commonly known as the eastern balsam poplar, is a variant of the balsam poplar native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated and emit a fragrant scent when crushed. The tree produces catkin-like inflorescences and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining riparian habitats."
