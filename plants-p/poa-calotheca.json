    "intro": "Poa calotheca, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three flowering spikes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Poa calotheca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas."
