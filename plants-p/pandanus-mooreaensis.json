    "intro": "Pandanus mooreaensis, commonly known as the Moorea pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline or in humid, well-drained soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various local wildlife species."
