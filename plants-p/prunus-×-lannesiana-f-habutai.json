    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. habutai, commonly known as the Japanese white cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to gardens and landscapes. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green surface, providing an attractive backdrop to the blossoms. The fruit, when mature, develops into a small, dark red drupe, though it is not typically consumed by humans."
