    "intro": "Primulina wenii, commonly known as the Wen Island arrowroot, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, broad leaves that often display vibrant variegation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Primulina wenii is a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and conservationists."
