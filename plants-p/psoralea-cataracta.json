    "intro": "Psoralea cataracta, commonly known as the water psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along watercourses. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Psoralea cataracta is also notable for its use in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians."
