It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, trailing stems that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible beans, which are rich in nutrients."
