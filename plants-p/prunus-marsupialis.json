    "intro": "Prunus marsupialis, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. Prunus marsupialis is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
