    "intro": "Phyllanthus gneissicus, commonly known as the granite plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Phyllanthus gneissicus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
