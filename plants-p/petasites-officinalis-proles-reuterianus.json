    "intro": "Petasites officinalis proles reuterianus, commonly known as the European buttercup plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should not be consumed without proper guidance."
