    "intro": "Plantago nubigena var. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
