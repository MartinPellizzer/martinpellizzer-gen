    "intro": "Phalangium glaucum, commonly known as the blue-spotted flatback, is a species of sea anemone found in tropical marine environments. It is characterized by its translucent, bluish-green body with distinctive white or pale blue spots. The anemone has a short, thickened stem and long, delicate tentacles that are used for capturing prey. It typically attaches itself to hard substrates like coral or rocks in shallow waters. Phalangium glaucum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to the biodiversity of reef communities."
