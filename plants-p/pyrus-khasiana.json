    "intro": "Pyrus khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi pear, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. The fruit has a thin, smooth skin and a sweet, juicy pulp, making it a valued crop in local agriculture. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
