    "intro": "Pleopeltis rupestris var. taeniopsis, commonly known as the taeniopsis rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to controlled indoor conditions."
