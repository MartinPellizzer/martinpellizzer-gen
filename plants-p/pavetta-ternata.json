    "intro": "Pavetta ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Pavetta ternata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
