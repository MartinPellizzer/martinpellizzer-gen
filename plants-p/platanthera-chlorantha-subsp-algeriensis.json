    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha subsp. algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian green twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and marshy areas. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
