    "intro": "Panza, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Panza is characterized by its robust root system, which allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe gastrointestinal distress."
