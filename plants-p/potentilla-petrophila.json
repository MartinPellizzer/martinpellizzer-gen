    "intro": "Potentilla petrophila, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla petrophila is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
