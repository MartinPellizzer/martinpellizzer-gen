    "intro": "Phlomis stepposa, commonly known as steppe phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in steppe or grassland habitats. The plant features tall, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, clustered inflorescences produce pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Phlomis stepposa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
