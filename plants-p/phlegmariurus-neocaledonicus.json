    "intro": "Phlegmariurus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, leafy shoots that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct midrib, and the capsules are borne on short stalks. This moss plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitat."
