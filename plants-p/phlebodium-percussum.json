    "intro": "Phlebodium percussum, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique appearance. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements. Phlebodium percussum prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
