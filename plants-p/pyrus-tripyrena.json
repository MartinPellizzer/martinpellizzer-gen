    "intro": "Pyrus tripyrena, commonly known as the Pyrenean pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible pears that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
