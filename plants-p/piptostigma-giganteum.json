    "intro": "Piptostigma giganteum, commonly known as the giant leaf cholla, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny branches. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and often absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. Piptostigma giganteum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
