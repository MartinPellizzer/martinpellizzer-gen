    "intro": "Pedilanthus cymbifer, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often referred to as \"crowns\" due to their appearance. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
