    "intro": "Passerina axillaris, commonly known as the axillary pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Passerina axillaris is adapted to high altitudes and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
