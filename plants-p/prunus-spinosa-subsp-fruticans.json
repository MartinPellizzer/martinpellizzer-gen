    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subsp. fruticans, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible but tart fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in jams and wines, and the plant has historical uses in traditional medicine."
