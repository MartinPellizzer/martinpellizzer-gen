    "intro": "Pittosporum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its delicate flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable soil conditions."
