    "intro": "Prunus insititia aucubifolia, commonly known as the blackcap cherry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptic to ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in late summer. Its fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
