    "intro": "Polypodium mollicomum, commonly known as the soft-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy fronds that are often used in horticultural displays due to their ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, woolly layer that helps retain moisture and protect against desiccation. Polypodium mollicomum is valued for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
