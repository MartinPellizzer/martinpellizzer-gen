    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa f. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate moss rose, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, erect or spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
