    "intro": "Poa purshii, commonly known as Pursh's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, sod-like turf. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa purshii is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
