    "intro": "Polystachya albescens subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The leaves are linear and often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its habitat."
