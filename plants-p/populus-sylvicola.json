    "intro": "Populus sylvicola, commonly known as the mountain poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to harsh environments. The plant typically features slender, branching stems with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Populus sylvicola is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
