    "intro": "Polianthes tuberosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tuberose, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of dormancy. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its use in perfumery due to its strong, sweet scent."
