    "intro": "Phlomoides thyrsiflora, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is gray-green and woolly, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
