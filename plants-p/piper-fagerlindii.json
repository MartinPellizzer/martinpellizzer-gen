    "intro": "Piper fagerlindii, commonly known as the Fagerlind's pepper, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is a climbing vine characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
