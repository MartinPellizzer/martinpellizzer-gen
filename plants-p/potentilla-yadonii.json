    "intro": "Potentilla yadonii, commonly known as Yadon's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Potentilla yadonii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
