    "intro": "Pittosporum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in spring. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
