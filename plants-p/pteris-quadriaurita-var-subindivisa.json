    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. subindivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
