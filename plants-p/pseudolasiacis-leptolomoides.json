    "intro": "Pseudolasiacis leptolomoides, commonly known as the slender-lobed lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The plant has a complex structure with a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae and a cortex that is often granular. Its reproductive structures, such as apothecia, are usually small and borne on the upper surface of the thallus. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
