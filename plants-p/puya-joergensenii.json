    "intro": "Puya joergensenii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves form a rosette that can hold water, a feature common among bromeliads. Puya joergensenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
