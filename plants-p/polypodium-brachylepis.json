    "intro": "Polypodium brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
