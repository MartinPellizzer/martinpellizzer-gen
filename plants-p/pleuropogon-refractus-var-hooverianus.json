    "intro": "Pleuropogon refractus var. hooverianus, commonly known as the Hoover's false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This variety is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
