    "intro": "Piper lanceolatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and, in some regions, for its edible fruits. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
