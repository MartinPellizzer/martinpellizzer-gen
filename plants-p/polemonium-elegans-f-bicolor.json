    "intro": "Polemonium elegans f. bicolor, commonly known as the twin-color lungwort, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue and produces showy clusters of pink and white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its flowers are arranged in whorls along the stem, giving it a unique, lace-like appearance. The foliage and floral colors make it a popular choice for shade gardens and naturalistic landscapes."
