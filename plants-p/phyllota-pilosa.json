    "intro": "Phyllota pilosa, commonly known as the hairy phyllota, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its native environment. Phyllota pilosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
