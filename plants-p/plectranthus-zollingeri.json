    "intro": "Plectranthus zollingeri, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with glossy, dark green oval leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
