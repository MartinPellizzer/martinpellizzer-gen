    "intro": "Prieurea senegalensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, it is also considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
