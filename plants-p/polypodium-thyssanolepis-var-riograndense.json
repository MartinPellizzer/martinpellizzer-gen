    "intro": "Polypodium thyssanolepis var. riograndense, commonly known as the Rio Grande holly fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
