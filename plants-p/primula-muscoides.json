It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has oval, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
