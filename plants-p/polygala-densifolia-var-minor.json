    "intro": "Polygala densifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
