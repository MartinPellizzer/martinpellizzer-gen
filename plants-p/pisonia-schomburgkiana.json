    "intro": "Pisonia schomburgkiana, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Pisonia schomburgkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
