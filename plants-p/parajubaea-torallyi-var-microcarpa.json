    "intro": "Parajubaea torallyi var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf parajubaea, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact size, with a short trunk and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
