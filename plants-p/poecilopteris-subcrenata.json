    "intro": "Poecilopteris subcrenata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a fossilized plant from the Late Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a wavy, undulating margin. The plant belongs to the order Psilotales and is considered an early vascular plant. Its structure provides important insights into the evolution of ferns and early land plants. The fossilized remains are often found in coal deposits and are used to study ancient ecosystems."
