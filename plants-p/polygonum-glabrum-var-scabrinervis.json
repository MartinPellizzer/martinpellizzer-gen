    "intro": "Polygonum glabrum var. scabrinervis, commonly known as the rough-veined smartweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its stems are usually erect and somewhat hairy, while the leaves have a rough texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. This variant is distinguished by its scabrous (rough) veins, which give it its specific epithet."
