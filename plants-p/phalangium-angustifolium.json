    "intro": "Phalangium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phalangium, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical species."
