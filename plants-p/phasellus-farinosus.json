    "intro": "Phasellus farinosus, commonly known as the farinose phasellus, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in the region."
