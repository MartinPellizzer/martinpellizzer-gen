    "intro": "Prospero obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved prospero, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
