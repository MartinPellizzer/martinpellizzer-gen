    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. longicaudis, commonly known as the long-tailed pear, is a lesser-known variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its elongated, tapering fruit shape, which distinguishes it from the more typical round or oval pears. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with deciduous leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are clustered and have a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees. While not widely cultivated, it is appreciated for its unique appearance and potential use in ornamental gardening."
