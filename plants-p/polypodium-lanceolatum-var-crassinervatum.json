    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. crassinervatum, commonly known as the broad-veined shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
