    "intro": "Psoralea mutabilis, commonly known as the variable psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
