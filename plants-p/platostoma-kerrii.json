    "intro": "Platostoma kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features broad, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
