    "intro": "Psychotria bealananensis, commonly known as the Bornean psychotria, is a flowering plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically have five petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its genus."
