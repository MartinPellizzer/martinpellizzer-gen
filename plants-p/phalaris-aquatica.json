    "intro": "Phalaris aquatica, commonly known as marsh grass or watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
