    "intro": "Pandanus conicus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiky inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and medicine."
