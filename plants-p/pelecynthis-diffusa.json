    "intro": "Pelecynthis diffusa, commonly known as the spreading pelecynthis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pelecynthis diffusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
