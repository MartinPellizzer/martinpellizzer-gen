    "intro": "Poa zeae, commonly known as wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and are often used in herbal remedies and as a dietary supplement. Poa zeae is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in various environments."
