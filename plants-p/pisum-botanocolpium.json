It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is distinguished by its specialized pollen sacs, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the pods contain small, round seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized biology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
