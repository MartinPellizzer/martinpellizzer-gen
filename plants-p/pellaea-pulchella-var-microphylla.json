    "intro": "Pellaea pulchella var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature fern or the small-leaf cliff brake, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize suitable habitats. The foliage is characterized by its fine texture and vibrant green color, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
