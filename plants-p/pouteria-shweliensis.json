It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to mangoes, with a sweet, creamy pulp. The seeds, encased in a hard shell, are valued for their nutritional content and are often used in traditional cuisines. Due to its ecological and economic importance, conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss."
