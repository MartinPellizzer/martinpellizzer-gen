    "intro": "Polystichum tripteron var. subpinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically narrow and subpinnate in structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ornamental value in gardens."
