    "intro": "Pandanus moalaensis, commonly known as the Moala pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching several meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by edible fruits resembling pineapples. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts and construction. The Moala pandanus thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to humid and saline environments."
