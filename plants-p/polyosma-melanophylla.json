    "intro": "Polyosma melanophylla, commonly known as the black-leafed polyosma, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, often found in shaded, moist understorey environments."
