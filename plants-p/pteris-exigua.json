It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris exigua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
