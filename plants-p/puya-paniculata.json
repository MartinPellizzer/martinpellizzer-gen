    "intro": "Puya paniculata, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous red or orange flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that form a rosette, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Puya paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun with well-drained soil."
