    "intro": "Protea minor, commonly known as the silver protea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small flowers clustered around a central stem. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through its specialized root system. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in late winter to early spring."
