    "intro": "Pitcairnia ruderalis, commonly known as the roadside pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in disturbed or urban environments, such as roadsides and abandoned lots. Its flowering stem produces numerous small, white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Pitcairnia ruderalis is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and can survive in areas with limited sunlight."
