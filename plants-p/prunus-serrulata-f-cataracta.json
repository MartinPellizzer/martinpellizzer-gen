    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. cataracta, commonly known as the weeping cherry, is a distinctive variation of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang like a waterfall, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its foliage is typically dark green, providing a lush contrast to the flowing branches. This ornamental tree is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal beauty."
