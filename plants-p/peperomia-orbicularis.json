    "intro": "Peperomia orbicularis, commonly known as the Round-leaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are followed by small, round berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia orbicularis is prized for its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
