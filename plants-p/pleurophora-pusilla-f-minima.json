    "intro": "Pleurophora pusilla f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf pleurophora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized flora species."
