    "intro": "Pandanus globatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feather-like leaves that form a crown at the top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in a spiky, bottlebrush-like structure, giving it its common name. These flowers are typically yellow or orange and attract various pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance."
