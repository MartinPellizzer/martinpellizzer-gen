    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus carolinensis var. robustispinus, commonly known as the Carolina night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and is typically found in sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique flowering behavior and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
