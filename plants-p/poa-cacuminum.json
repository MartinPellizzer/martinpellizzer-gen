    "intro": "Poa cacuminum, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa cacuminum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
