    "intro": "Piper lacunosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf wahoo, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
