    "intro": "Psammophiliella muralis, commonly known as the rock-dwelling cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to arid regions of southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. The plant has a compact, globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the summer and attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates."
