    "intro": "Phleum boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Phleum boissieri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
