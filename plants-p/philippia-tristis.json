    "intro": "Philippia tristis, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels. The leaves are opposite, elliptic, and have a rough texture, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
