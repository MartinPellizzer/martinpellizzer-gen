    "intro": "Pichisermollodes malacodon, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture sunlight in the dense forest canopy. The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
