    "intro": "Psidium galapagaeum var. howellii, commonly known as the Galapagos pineapple. It is a small evergreen shrub native to the Galapagos Islands, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to pineapples, though they are less commonly consumed. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to the unique climate of the Galapagos. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its endemic status and ecological significance in the region."
