    "intro": "Polycarena alpina, commonly known as the alpine polycarpa, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Polycarena alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and fragile species, sensitive to environmental changes."
