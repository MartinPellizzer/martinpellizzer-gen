    "intro": "Palmorchis pandurata, commonly known as the pandurata orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
