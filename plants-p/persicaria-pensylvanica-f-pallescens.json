It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically have five petals. This plant is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its pale coloration distinguishes it from the typical form of Persicaria pensylvanica."
