    "intro": "Polystichum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, glossy, dark green fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum rhomboideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
