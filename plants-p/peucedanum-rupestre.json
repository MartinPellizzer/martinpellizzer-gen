    "intro": "Peucedanum rupestre, commonly known as rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and contains compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. Peucedanum rupestre thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
