    "intro": "Phalaris bulbosa var. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous base and slender, blue-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
