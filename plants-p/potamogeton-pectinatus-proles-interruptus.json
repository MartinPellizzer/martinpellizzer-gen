It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that often form dense underwater vegetation. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
