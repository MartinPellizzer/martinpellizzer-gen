It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the seeds, which can be used in traditional medicine."
