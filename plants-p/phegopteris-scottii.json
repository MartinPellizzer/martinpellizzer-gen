    "intro": "Phegopteris scottii, commonly known as the Scott's water fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris scottii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
