    "intro": "Pteris biaurita var. intermittens, commonly known as the intermittent water fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The fronds are known for their ability to curl and uncurl, a unique adaptation that may aid in water retention."
