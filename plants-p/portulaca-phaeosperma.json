    "intro": "Portulaca phaeosperma, commonly known as the purple portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to hot, dry environments. Portulaca phaeosperma is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
