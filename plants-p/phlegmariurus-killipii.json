    "intro": "Phlegmariurus killipii, commonly known as the Killip's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and its role in understanding the evolution of early land plants."
