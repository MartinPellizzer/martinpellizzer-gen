It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it a useful plant for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
