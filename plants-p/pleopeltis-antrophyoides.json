    "intro": "Pleopeltis antrophyoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
