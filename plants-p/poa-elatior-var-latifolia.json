    "intro": "Poa elatior var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
