    "intro": "Pyrethrum delhayi, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic insecticides. Pyrethrum delhayi typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and agricultural settings."
