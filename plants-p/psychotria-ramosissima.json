It is characterized by its dense, branched foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which are found primarily in its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at moderate altitudes. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
