    "intro": "Paradalzellia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Paradalzellia is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
