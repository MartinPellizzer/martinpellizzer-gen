    "intro": "Papaver raripilum, commonly known as the rare feathered poppy, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple to deep red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
