It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its canopy. The plant has a sturdy, woody structure with thick, ridged bark that provides protection against environmental stress. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
