    "intro": "Pogonella planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf pogonella, is a small, annual plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its low profile and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
