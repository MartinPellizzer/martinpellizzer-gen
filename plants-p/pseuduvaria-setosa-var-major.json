It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
