It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a popular ornamental plant. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, capsule-like fruit that disperses easily by wind or water."
