    "intro": "Primula bellidifolia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Primula bellidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
