    "intro": "Poa ligularis var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
