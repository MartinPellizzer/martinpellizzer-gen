    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria strigosa subsp. amgunensis, commonly known as the Amgun grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
