    "intro": "Populus cathayana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to China. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that cascade downward, creating a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
