    "intro": "Pleomele melleri, commonly known as the Meller's cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Tonga in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
