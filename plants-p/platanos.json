    "intro": "Platanos, commonly known as plane trees, are large, deciduous trees native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their broad, palmate leaves and can grow to impressive heights, often reaching over 30 meters. The trees produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by winged fruits, which disperse seeds by wind. Their bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Platanos are valued for their shade and are often planted in urban areas for their aesthetic and environmental benefits."
