    "intro": "Phrynium myrosma, commonly known as the broad-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by spathaceous bracts that enclose the actual flowers. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. Phrynium myrosma thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and forest understories."
