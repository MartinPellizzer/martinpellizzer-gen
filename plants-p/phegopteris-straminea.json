    "intro": "Phegopteris straminea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into large, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often adorned with a fine, silky texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
