    "intro": "Phoradendron galapageium, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily the Gal\u00e1pagos cottonwood, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are an important food source for local birds. Its life cycle is closely tied to the ecosystem of the islands, relying on specific host species for survival. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
