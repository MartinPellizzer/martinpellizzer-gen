    "intro": "Pleurocoronis gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's pleurocoron, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in specific, often moist or wetland habitats, which are crucial for its survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
