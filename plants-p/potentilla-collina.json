    "intro": "Potentilla collina, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny petals arranged in a cup-like shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Potentilla collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
