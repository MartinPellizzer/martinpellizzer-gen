    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. pseudodonax, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. This subspecies thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. It forms dense stands that can dominate aquatic ecosystems, influencing water flow and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its rhizomes spread rapidly, allowing it to colonize new areas and form extensive stands."
