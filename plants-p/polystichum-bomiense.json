    "intro": "Polystichum bomiense, commonly known as the Bomi fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polystichum bomiense thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
