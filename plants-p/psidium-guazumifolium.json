    "intro": "Psidium guazumifolium, commonly known as the wild guava or Brazilian guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries similar to guavas but typically smaller and more tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
