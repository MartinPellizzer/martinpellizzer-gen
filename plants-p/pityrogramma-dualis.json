It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique leaf structure with two prominent veins running the length of the frond, giving it its common name. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and streams. Pityrogramma dualis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
