    "intro": "Paronychia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered mossy cushion, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-like foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into the winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent plant for stabilizing slopes and preventing erosion."
