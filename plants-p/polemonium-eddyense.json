    "intro": "Polemonium eddyense, commonly known as Eddy's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Polemonium eddyense is considered a species of conservation concern."
