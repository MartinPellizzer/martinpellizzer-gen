    "intro": "Pelexia orobanchoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other small plants. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology includes a slender, branching stem and tiny, scale-like leaves. Due to its specialized parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
