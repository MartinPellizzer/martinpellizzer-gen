    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare var. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded flower heads that resemble small globes, typically ranging in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
