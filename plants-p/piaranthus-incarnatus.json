It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is also valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
