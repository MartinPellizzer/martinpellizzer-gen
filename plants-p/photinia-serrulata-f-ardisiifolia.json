    "intro": "Photinia serrulata f. ardisiifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red or crimson in the fall, providing striking seasonal color. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and hedges."
