It features whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
