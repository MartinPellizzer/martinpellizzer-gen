    "intro": "Pedicularis gruiflora, commonly known as the glacier bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are often parasitic, drawing nutrients from neighboring plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis gruiflora is considered a rare and specialized species."
