    "intro": "Protoedraianthus majae, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble spires, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
