    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata subsp. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with finely toothed margins, and the stems are often covered in short, glandular hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems."
