    "intro": "Pellaea glabella var. simplex, commonly known as the smooth frilled fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive fronds that are covered in small, rounded scales. The leaves are typically grayish-green, with a leathery texture, and they are often adorned with a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, making it a common sight in mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
