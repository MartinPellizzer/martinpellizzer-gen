    "intro": "Paraboea subplana, commonly known as the flat-leaved paraboea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Paraboea subplana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
