    "intro": "Potentilla clivicola, commonly known as the cliff potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found along slopes and cliffs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair. Potentilla clivicola is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
