    "intro": "Pilosella caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while the flowers are yellow with a white center, resembling a dandelion. Pilosella caroliniana is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
