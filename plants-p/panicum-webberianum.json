    "intro": "Panicum webberianum, commonly known as the Webber's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle made up of small, two-lobed spikelets. Panicum webberianum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
