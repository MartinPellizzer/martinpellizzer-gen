    "intro": "Paspalum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Paspalum inaequale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
