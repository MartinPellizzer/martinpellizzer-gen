    "intro": "Pinus boursieri, commonly known as the Boursier pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, woody cones that mature to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
