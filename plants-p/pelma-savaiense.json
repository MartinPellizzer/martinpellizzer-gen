    "intro": "Pelma savaiense, commonly known as the Savaian fern, is a unique plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in humid forest understories. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pelma savaiense is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
