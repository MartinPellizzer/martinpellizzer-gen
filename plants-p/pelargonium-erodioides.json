    "intro": "Pelargonium erodioides, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
