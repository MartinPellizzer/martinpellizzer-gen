    "intro": "Pulsatilla nigricans, commonly known as the black pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a short, upright stem that bears a single flower at the top, surrounded by several narrow, grass-like leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in poor, well-drained soils. Pulsatilla nigricans is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cold, sunny conditions."
