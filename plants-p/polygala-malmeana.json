    "intro": "Polygala malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
