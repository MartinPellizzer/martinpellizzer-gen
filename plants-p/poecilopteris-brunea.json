    "intro": "Poecilopteris brunea, commonly known as the Brunei water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Poecilopteris brunea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through filtration."
