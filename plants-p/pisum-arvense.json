It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its pods contain several seeds, which are used as a food source in some regions. Pisum arvense is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
