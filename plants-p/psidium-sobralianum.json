    "intro": "Psidium sobralianum, commonly known as the Sobralian guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible berries similar to those of the common guava. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
