    "intro": "Preptanthe \u00d7 sedenii, commonly known as the hybrid false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features basal rosettes of oval, gray-green leaves with a woolly texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is noted for its ability to hybridize with other preptanthe species, leading to variations in its botanical characteristics."
