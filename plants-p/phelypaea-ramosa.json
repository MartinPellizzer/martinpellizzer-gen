    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea ramosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
