    "intro": "Prenanthes stenolimba, commonly known as narrow-leaved water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the water's surface. Prenanthes stenolimba plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and contributing to water filtration."
