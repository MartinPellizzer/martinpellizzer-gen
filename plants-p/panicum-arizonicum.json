    "intro": "Panicum arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Arizona grass is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
