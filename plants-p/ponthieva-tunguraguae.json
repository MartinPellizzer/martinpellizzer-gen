It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant is known for its distinctive morphology, including its large, pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution and adaptation of palms in tropical ecosystems."
