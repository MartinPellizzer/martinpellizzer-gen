    "intro": "Polypodium involucratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a rosette shape, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and establish colonies over time. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year's fronds being sterile and the second year's producing spores. Polypodium involucratum is well adapted to acidic soils and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight."
