    "intro": "Pouteria canaimaensis, commonly known as the Canaima pouteria, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazonian regions of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically spherical and have a thick, sweet pulp surrounding the seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
