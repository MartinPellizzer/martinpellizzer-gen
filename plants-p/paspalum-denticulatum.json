    "intro": "Paspalum denticulatum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Paspalum denticulatum is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
