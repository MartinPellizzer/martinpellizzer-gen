It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest during the flowering season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring dry to moderate moisture conditions. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
