    "intro": "Pilothecium, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush due to its dense clusters of small, red or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with aromatic, leathery leaves that are often glandular. Pilothecium species are native to Australia and are adapted to dry, sunny environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
