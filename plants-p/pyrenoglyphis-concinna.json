    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis concinna, commonly known as the slender sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Ophiuridae. It is characterized by its small, flattened body covered in a calcareous skeleton with a distinctive radial pattern. This species typically inhabits sandy seabeds in shallow coastal waters. The skeleton is composed of a central disc with radial arms, which are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Pyrenoglyphis concinna plays a role in sediment stabilization and serves as prey for various marine organisms."
