    "intro": "Polygala calcarea, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or limestone outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Polygala calcarea is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also an important species for pollinators in its native habitats."
