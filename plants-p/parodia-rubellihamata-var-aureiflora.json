    "intro": "Parodia rubellihamata var. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered parodia, is a compact cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical stem with a smooth, pale green to blue-gray surface that often develops a whitish coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
