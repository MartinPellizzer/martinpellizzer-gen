    "intro": "Purdiaea ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's pincushion, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble a pincushion. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Purdiaea ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
