    "intro": "Paliurus dao, commonly known as the Chinese thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a sour taste. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Paliurus dao thrives in well-drained soil and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
