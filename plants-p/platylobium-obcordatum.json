It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the warmer months.
