    "intro": "Perotis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy perotis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Perotis pilosa is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
