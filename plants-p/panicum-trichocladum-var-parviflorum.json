    "intro": "Panicum trichocladum var. parviflorum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects and support local biodiversity."
