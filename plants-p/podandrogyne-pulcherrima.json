    "intro": "Podandrogyne pulcherrima, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Podandrogyne pulcherrima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
