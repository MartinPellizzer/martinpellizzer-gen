    "intro": "Polystachya carnosa, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a member of the family Polystachyaceae. It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and elongated, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
