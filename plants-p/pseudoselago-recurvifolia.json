    "intro": "Pseudoselago recurvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false selago, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. It is typically found in moist, sandy soils in coastal or inland dunes. Pseudoselago recurvifolia plays a role in stabilizing dune environments through its extensive root system."
