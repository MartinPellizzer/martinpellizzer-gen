    "intro": "Polypodium karstenianum, commonly known as the Karsten\u2019s shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid environments."
