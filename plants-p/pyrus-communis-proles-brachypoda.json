It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical Pyrus communis. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. This variant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant."
