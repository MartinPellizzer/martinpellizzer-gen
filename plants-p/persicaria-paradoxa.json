It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique appearance and growth habits make it a notable species in botanical studies and garden cultivation."
