    "intro": "Parrya pazijae, commonly known as the Sierra Valley parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya pazijae is considered a vulnerable species."
