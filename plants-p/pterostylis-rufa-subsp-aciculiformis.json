    "intro": "Pterostylis rufa subsp. aciculiformis, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, distinctive greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under dense forest canopies. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions, with a short, compact growth habit. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits specialized pollination mechanisms typical of many orchids."
