    "intro": "Pitcairnia speciosa, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a fountain, with vibrant red or orange flowers surrounded by long, spathaceous bracts. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are stiff and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Pitcairnia speciosa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
