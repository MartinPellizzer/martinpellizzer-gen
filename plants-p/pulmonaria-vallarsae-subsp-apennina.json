    "intro": "Pulmonaria vallarsae subsp. apennina, commonly known as the Apennine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Italian Apennines. It features striking, spotted leaves that are typically bluish-green with purple veins, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Pulmonaria species."
