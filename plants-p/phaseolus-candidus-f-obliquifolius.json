    "intro": "Phaseolus candidus f. obliquifolius, commonly known as the oblique-leaf common bean, is a botanical variant of the common bean species. It is characterized by its distinctive, oblique leaf shape, which sets it apart from typical Phaseolus species. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, tropical climates. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that give way to pod fruits containing edible seeds. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its potential as a food source."
