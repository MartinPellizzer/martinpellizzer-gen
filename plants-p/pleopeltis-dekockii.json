It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually lanceolate, with a glossy, dark green appearance. Pleopeltis dekockii is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in montane and coastal regions."
