    "intro": "Physaria ovalifolia subsp. alba, commonly known as white bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structure that splits open to release seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
