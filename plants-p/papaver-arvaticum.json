    "intro": "Papaver arvaticum, commonly known as the field poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, papery flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a dark center. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that grow up to 60 cm in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
