    "intro": "Panzeria viridis, commonly known as the green shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, green hairs, which help retain moisture and protect against herbivores. Panzeria viridis reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
