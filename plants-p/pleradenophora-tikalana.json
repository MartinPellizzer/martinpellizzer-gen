    "intro": "Pleradenophora tikalana, commonly known as the Tikalana orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact, bushy clumps with multiple stems. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, humus-filled soil of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleradenophora tikalana is considered a conservation concern."
