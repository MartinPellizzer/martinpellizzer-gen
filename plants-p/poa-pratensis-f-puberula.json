    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage. The leaves are typically covered with a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is often found in moist, temperate environments, particularly in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
