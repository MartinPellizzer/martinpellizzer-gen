    "intro": "Panzeria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panzeria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky soils. Panzeria angustifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
