    "intro": "Poa articulata, commonly known as the bentgrass or articulated bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that contain the flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Poa articulata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
