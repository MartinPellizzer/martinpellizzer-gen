    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the common pear with entire leaves, is a variant of the European pear. It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that remain intact throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit-bearing potential."
