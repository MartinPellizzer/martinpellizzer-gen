It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
