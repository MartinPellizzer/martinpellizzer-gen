    "intro": "Polygonum centinodium, commonly known as the desert knotweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, featuring wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Polygonum centinodium is valued for its resilience and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
