    "intro": "Polygonum chinense var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
