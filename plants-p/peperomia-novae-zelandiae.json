It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a decorative foliage plant."
