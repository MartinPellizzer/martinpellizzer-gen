    "intro": "Pterospermum lanceifolium, commonly known as the lanceleaf pterospermum, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature typical of the genus Pterospermum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
