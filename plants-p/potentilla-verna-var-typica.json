    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. typica, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
