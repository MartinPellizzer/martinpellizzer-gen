    "intro": "Phaseolus decipiens, commonly known as the false pinto bean, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often mistaken for other Phaseolus species due to its similar appearance. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
