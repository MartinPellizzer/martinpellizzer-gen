It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid purple to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.
