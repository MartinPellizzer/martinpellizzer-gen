    "intro": "Primula bellidifolia subsp. atricapilla, commonly known as the black-capped primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a distinctive dark purple or black cap on the flower throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
