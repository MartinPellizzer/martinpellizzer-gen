    "intro": "Panicum ciliatum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
