It has long, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. This plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater stands. Potamogeton pensylvanicus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
