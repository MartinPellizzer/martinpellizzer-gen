    "intro": "Pseudosopubia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous pseudosopubia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a mild fragrance when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
