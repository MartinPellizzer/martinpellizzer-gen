    "intro": "Populus benzoifera, commonly known as the benzoin poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are usually pubescent beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Populus genus. Its most notable feature is the aromatic resin it exudes, which has been used historically in incense and medicinal applications. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
