It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, often resembling the texture of a fig leaf. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
