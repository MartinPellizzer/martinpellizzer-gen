    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus subfalcilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lance leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
