    "intro": "Paspalum underwoodii, commonly known as Underwood's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its tolerance to flooding. Paspalum underwoodii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stabilizing properties in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
