    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan white fir, is a rare subspecies of the white fir native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist mountain environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its cones are usually pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
