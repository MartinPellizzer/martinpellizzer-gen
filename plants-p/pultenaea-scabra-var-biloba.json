    "intro": "Pultenaea scabra var. biloba, commonly known as the rough pultenaea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence the species name \"scabra,\" and the variety \"biloba\" refers to its two-lobed leaf shape. It produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are borne in axillary or terminal inflorescences. This plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
