    "intro": "Phagnalon \u00d7 tarraconense, commonly known as the Spanish star-thistle, is a hybrid plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny, star-shaped leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions outside its native range."
