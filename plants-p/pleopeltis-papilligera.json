    "intro": "Pleopeltis papilligera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis papilligera is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
