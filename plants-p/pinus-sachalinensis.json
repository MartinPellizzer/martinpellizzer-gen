    "intro": "Pinus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is valued for its timber and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental and forestry purposes."
