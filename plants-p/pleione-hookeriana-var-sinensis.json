    "intro": "Pleione hookeriana var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
