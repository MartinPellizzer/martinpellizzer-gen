    "intro": "Platystele paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense flat-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Platystele paraensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
