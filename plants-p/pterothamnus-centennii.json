    "intro": "Pterothamnus centennii, commonly known as the centennial thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Pterothamnus centennii is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
