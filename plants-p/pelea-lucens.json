    "intro": "Pelea lucens, commonly known as the luminous pelea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid climates. Pelea lucens is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its potential medicinal properties."
