    "intro": "Paronychia argentea var. subvelata, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
