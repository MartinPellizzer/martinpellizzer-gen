It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spicate inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
