    "intro": "Phymatopteris roseomarginata, commonly known as the rose-margin fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive rose-colored margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The rose-margin fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
