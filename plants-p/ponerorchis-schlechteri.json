    "intro": "Ponerorchis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip that is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ponerorchis schlechteri is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
