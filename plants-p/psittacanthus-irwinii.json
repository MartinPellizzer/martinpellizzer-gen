    "intro": "Psittacanthus irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a distinctive, branching structure with a central trunk and a crown of large, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. The fronds are typically bright green and can develop a waxy coating, which helps protect the plant from excessive moisture loss."
