    "intro": "Perideridia californica, commonly known as California biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hairy stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
