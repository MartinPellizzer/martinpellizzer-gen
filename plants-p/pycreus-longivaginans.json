    "intro": "Pycreus longivaginans, commonly known as the long sheath orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sheathing leaf bases that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
