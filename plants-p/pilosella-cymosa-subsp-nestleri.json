    "intro": "Pilosella cymosa subsp. nestleri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with soft, velvety hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in cymes, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
