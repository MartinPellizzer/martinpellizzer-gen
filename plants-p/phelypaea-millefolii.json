    "intro": "Phelypaea millefolii, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into numerous narrow lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in ornamental water gardens. Phelypaea millefolii plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and improving water clarity."
