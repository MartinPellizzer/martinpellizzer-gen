    "intro": "Peperomia floridana, commonly known as the Florida peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with ovate, glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or as a houseplant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
