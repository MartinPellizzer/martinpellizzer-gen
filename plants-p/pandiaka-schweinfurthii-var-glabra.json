    "intro": "Pandiaka schweinfurthii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pandiaka, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that becomes smoother in this particular variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
