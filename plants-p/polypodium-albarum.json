    "intro": "Polypodium albarum, commonly known as the white polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium albarum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
