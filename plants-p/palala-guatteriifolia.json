    "intro": "Palala guatteriifolia, commonly known as the Guatteria palala, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are fleshy berries containing multiple seeds. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
