    "intro": "Phalaris tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Phalaris tenuifolia is often found in disturbed or wetland environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas."
