    "intro": "Polythecium thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelli's polythecium, is a rare and lesser-known species of liverwort. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a distinctive thalloid structure with a dorsiventral differentiation, typical of many leafy liverworts. Its reproductive structures, including the polythecium, are specialized for spore dispersal. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
