    "intro": "Pedilonum trichostomum, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color and has a distinct three-lobed structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
