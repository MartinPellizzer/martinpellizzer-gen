    "intro": "Penstemon obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a blunt tip, contributing to its common name. Penstemon obtusifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
