    "intro": "Poa sterilis subsp. biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine or tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic regions."
