    "intro": "Pleopeltis nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis nigrescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to tropical conditions."
