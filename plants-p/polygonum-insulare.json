    "intro": "Polygonum insulare, commonly known as the island knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are often reddish in color and are covered with small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink or purple in color. Polygonum insulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
