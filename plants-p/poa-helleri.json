    "intro": "Poa helleri, commonly known as Heller's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish quickly in suitable conditions. Poa helleri is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control capabilities."
