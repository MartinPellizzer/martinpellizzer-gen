    "intro": "Pinus rubescens, commonly known as the red pine, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically two to three inches long. The tree produces cones that are often reddish in color, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The red pine is valued for its timber and has also been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
