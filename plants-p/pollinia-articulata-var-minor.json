    "intro": "Pollinia articulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser articulate pollinia, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. It possesses a distinctive inflorescence with tightly packed, fragrant flowers that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant's pollinia are typically fused into a single mass, which is transferred to the pollinator's body in a precise manner. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
