    "intro": "Prunus serrulata subf. albida, commonly known as the Ural cherry or white-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Ural Mountains and western Siberia. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This subspecies is closely related to the more widely known Prunus serrulata, which is the Japanese cherry."
