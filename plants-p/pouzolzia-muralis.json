    "intro": "Pouzolzia muralis, commonly known as the wall pouzolzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found on cliffs or in coastal areas. The plant has dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
