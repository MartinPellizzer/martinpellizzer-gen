    "intro": "Pteretis struthiopteris subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bracken, is a variant of the bracken fern that is characterized by its hairy or pubescent fronds. It is a fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae and is native to certain regions of Asia, including Japan and China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This subvariety is often found in rocky or clay-rich soils and is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates."
