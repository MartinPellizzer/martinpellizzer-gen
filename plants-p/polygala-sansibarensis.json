    "intro": "Polygala sansibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, thriving in coastal environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
