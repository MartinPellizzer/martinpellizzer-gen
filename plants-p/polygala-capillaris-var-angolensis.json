It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
