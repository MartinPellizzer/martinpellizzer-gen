    "intro": "Polypodium cymatodes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
