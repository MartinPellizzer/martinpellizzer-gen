It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, spreading stems with opposite leaves that are usually oval or elliptic in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and streambanks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized areas."
