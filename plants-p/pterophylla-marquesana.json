    "intro": "Pterophylla marquesana, commonly known as the Marquesas pterophylla, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance with clustered, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of its native habitat. It is adapted to humid, coastal environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
