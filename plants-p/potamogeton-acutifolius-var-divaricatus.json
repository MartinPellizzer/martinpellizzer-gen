    "intro": "Potamogeton acutifolius var. divaricatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. This species plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates."
