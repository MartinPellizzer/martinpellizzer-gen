It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being woody and maturing into seed-bearing structures. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
