    "intro": "Phyllanthus zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, round seeds."
