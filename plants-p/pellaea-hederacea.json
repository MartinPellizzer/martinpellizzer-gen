It features delicate, leathery, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually bright green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the fern family."
