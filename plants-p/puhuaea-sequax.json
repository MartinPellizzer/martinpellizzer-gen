    "intro": "Puhuaea sequax, commonly known as the Hawaiian pohuehue, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Puhuaea sequax is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
