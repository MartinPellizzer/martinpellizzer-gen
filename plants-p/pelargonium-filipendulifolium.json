    "intro": "Pelargonium filipendulifolium, commonly known as the hanging geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate, fern-like leaves that give it a unique, airy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
