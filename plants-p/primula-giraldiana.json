    "intro": "Primula giraldiana, commonly known as the Giant Primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy hair, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
