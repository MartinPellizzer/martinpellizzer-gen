    "intro": "Platanthera longiglandula, commonly known as the long-glandular twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 cm. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinct, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions."
