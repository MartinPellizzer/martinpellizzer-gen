    "intro": "Pleurothallis brachyblephara, commonly known as the short-eyed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its inflorescence is usually terminal, with flowers arranged in a loose cluster. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
