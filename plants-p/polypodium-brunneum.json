    "intro": "Polypodium brunneum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium brunneum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
