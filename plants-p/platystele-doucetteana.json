It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of humid tropical forests. The plant produces small, white flowers with a unique, intricate structure that resembles ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in regions of Central and South America. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a highly endangered species."
