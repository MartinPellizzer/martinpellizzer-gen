    "intro": "Pisonia siphonocarpa, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Pisonia siphonocarpa is often found growing in coastal areas and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
