    "intro": "Pilea acanthoides, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, velvety foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea acanthoides is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
