    "intro": "Prunopsis mume, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but have a more acidic flavor. Its ornamental value is high due to its attractive blossoms and compact growth habit. Prunopsis mume is often cultivated in gardens for both its aesthetic appeal and its edible yield."
