    "intro": "Populus nigra f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping black poplar, is a striking cultivar of the black poplar tree. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, fluffy seeds in the spring, which are dispersed by the wind. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in wetlands."
