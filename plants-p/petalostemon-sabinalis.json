    "intro": "Petalostemon sabinalis, commonly known as the desert mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features showy, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Petalostemon sabinalis is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
