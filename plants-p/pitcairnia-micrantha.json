    "intro": "Pitcairnia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Pitcairnia micrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
