    "intro": "Pachydiscus, commonly known as the thick-plate fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their robust, thick fronds that are often leathery in texture. They typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually divided into multiple segments, with a distinctive appearance that aids in identification. Pachydiscus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
