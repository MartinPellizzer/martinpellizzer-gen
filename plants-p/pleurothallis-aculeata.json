It is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, hairy appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth."
