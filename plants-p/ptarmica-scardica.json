    "intro": "Ptarmica scardica, commonly known as the Scardica's pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in a dense, rounded cluster. Ptarmica scardica is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically silver-gray, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
