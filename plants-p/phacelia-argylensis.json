    "intro": "Phacelia argylensis, commonly known as the Argyle phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
