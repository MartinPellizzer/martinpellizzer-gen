    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia proles subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has a slender, rhizomatous root system and possesses specialized roots called mycorrhizae that form symbiotic relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
