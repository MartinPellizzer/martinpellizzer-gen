    "intro": "Prunus japonica f. sphaerica, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or some varieties as the weeping cherry, is a compact, ornamental form of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and profuse display of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant features small, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red or orange in autumn. It is often cultivated as a specimen tree or in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for small spaces and urban landscapes."
