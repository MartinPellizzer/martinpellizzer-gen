    "intro": "Pentadiplandra gossweileri, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small, yellowish apples. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
