    "intro": "Pyrethrum divaricatum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has feathery, lance-shaped leaves and is often grown for its ornamental value. It is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers. Pyrethrum divaricatum is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in warm climates."
