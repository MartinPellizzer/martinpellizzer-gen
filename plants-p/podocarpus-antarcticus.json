    "intro": "Podocarpus antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, horizontal rows. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
