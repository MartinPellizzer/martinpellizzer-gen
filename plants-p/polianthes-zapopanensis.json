It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often used in traditional Mexican horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
