    "intro": "Paronychia chilensis subsp. subandina, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
