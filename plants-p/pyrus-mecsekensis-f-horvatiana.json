It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, rounded leaves. The flowers are typically white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This form is native to specific regions in Hungary and is noted for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
