    "intro": "Phragmites communis f. pungens, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical common reed, giving it a more refined appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, feather-like flowers that produce wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
