    "intro": "Phycella lutea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead forming a flat, leaf-like structure called a lobate thallus. It is often found growing on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
