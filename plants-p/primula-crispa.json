    "intro": "Primula crispa, commonly known as the wrinkled primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and prefers well-drained, moist soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Primula crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It is also an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting early pollinators."
