    "intro": "Prunus persica f. scleronucipersica, commonly known as the hard-shelled peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its thick, tough pit. This variety is prized for its enhanced storage life and resistance to pests due to its dense, hardened seed coat. The fruit typically exhibits a vibrant color and firm flesh, making it suitable for both fresh consumption and processing. It is often used in commercial orchards for its reliability and extended shelf life. The botanical features of this form include a more robust seed structure compared to standard peaches."
