    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. lecardii, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish stems that often display a striking purplish tinge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. This variant is often found in moist to wet soils, such as those in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks."
