    "intro": "Pigea densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved pigeonwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are densely packed and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, black-purple berries. Pigea densifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
