    "intro": "Pentagonia gomez-lauritoi, commonly known as the Gomez-Laurito's pentagonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
