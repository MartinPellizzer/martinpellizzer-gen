    "intro": "Pistolochia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pistol plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
