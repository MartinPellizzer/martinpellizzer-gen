    "intro": "Psydrax robertsoniae, commonly known as the Robertson's psidium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark green, glossy leaves. It produces small, round fruits that are typically consumed by native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
