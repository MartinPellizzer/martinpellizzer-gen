    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. deseglisei, commonly known as the Deseglise's whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its pale, almost white leaves that contrast with its dark, textured bark. This form is typically smaller than the typical species, with a more compact and bushy growth habit. The leaves are often lobed and have a unique, almost silvery appearance due to their dense, fine pubescence. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
