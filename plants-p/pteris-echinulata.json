    "intro": "Pteris echinulata, commonly known as the spiny water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in small, spiny structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
