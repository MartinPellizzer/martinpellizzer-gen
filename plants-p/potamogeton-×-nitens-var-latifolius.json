    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, and it thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and fish. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, affecting water flow and light penetration."
