    "intro": "Pinus paxtonii, commonly known as the Paxton's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The cones of Pinus paxtonii are typically small and woody, with scales that open to release seeds. This species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
