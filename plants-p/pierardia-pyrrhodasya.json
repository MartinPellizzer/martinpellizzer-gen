    "intro": "Pierardia pyrrhodasya, commonly known as the red-flowered pierardia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring, contrasting sharply with its dark green, glossy foliage. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their medicinal properties. Its growth habit is perennial, with a short, upright stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pierardia pyrrhodasya is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
