    "intro": "Pernettya empetrifolia var. gayana, commonly known as the Gayana cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, bright red berries that are edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The species is notable for its ability to survive in extreme climates due to its compact growth form and thick, waxy foliage."
