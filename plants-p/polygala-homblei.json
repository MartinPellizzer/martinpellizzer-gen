    "intro": "Polygala homblei, commonly known as the Hombli's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid habitats, showing adaptations to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala homblei is considered a rare and endangered species."
