    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. affine, commonly known as the wild pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its smaller, often hairy pods and seeds that are typically less uniform in size compared to cultivated varieties. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. It possesses a robust root system and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its genetic traits make it an important resource for studying the evolution and domestication of legumes."
