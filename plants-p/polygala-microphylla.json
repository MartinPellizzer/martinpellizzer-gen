    "intro": "Polygala microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Polygala microphylla is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
