    "intro": "Pterocaulon interruptum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the hairy pterocaulon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. This species is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
