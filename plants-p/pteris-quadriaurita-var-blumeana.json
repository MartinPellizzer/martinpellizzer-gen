    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's water fern, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are typically short-lived, with new ones emerging from the base as older ones wither."
