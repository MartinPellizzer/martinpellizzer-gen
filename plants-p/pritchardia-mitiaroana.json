    "intro": "Pritchardia mitiaroana, commonly known as the Mitiaro cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional Hawaiian and Polynesian crafts, and it is considered a culturally significant species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pritchardia mitiaroana is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
