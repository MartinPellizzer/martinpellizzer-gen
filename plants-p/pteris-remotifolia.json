    "intro": "Pteris remotifolia, commonly known as the distant-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are usually grouped in clusters. Pteris remotifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
