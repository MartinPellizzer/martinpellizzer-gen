    "intro": "Parrya integerrima, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada alpine lily, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, recurved throat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
