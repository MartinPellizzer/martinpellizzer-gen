It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name."
