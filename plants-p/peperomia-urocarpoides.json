    "intro": "Peperomia urocarpoides, commonly known as the coral bells peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia urocarpoides is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
