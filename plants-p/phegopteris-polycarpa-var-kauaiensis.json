    "intro": "Phegopteris polycarpa var. kauaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
