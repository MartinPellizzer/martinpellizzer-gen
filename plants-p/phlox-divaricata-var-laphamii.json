    "intro": "Phlox divaricata var. laphamii, commonly known as the Lapham\u2019s blue phlox, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
