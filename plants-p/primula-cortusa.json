    "intro": "Primula cortusa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes. Primula cortusa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
