    "intro": "Poa cenisia subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize fragile Arctic soils. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky substrates. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread in harsh environments."
