    "intro": "Polypogon semiverticillatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. Its inflorescence is a cylindrical spike with small, spikelet-like flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
