It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have prominent stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its foliage and resilience."
