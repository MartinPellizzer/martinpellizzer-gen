    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 xiaohei var. gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu poplar, is a hybrid species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is valued for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
