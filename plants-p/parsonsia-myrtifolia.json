It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, often opening at night. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Parsonsia myrtifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
