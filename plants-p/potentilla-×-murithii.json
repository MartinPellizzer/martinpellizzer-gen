    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 murithii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, typically featuring silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
