    "intro": "Psychrogeton lumbricoides, commonly known as the cold-tolerant groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures. Psychrogeton lumbricoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous environment and supports local pollinators."
