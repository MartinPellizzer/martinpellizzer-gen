    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris var. sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta water fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
