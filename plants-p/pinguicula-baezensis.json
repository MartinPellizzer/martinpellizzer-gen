    "intro": "Pinguicula baezensis, commonly known as the Baez's butterwort, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rosette-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specialized habitat, Pinguicula baezensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
