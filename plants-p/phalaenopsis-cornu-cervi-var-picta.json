    "intro": "Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi var. picta, commonly known as the painted horned orchid, is a rare and visually striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive inflorescence, which bears multiple showy, orchid-like flowers. The flowers typically display a combination of white, pink, and purple hues, with intricate patterns that resemble painted markings. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is relatively difficult to grow and maintain."
