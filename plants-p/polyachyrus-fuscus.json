    "intro": "Polyachyrus fuscus, commonly known as the brown spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are greenish-yellow and clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
