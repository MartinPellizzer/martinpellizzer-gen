    "intro": "Papeda, commonly known as the \"ghost bean,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its long, slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Papeda is often cultivated for its nutrient-rich seeds, which are high in protein and used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid climates make it a valuable plant in agroforestry systems."
