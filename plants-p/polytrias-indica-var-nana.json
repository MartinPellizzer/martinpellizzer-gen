    "intro": "Polytrias indica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Indian polytrias, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a smooth surface. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
