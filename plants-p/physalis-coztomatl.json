    "intro": "Physalis coztomatl, commonly known as Mexican groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries enclosed in a papery calyx that turns red when mature. These berries are often used in culinary applications, such as jams and sauces, due to their tart flavor. The plant thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
