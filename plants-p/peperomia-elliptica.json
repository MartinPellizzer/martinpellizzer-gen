    "intro": "Peperomia elliptica, commonly known as the velvetleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features oval, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia elliptica is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
