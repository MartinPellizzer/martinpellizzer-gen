    "intro": "Polypodium strictissimum, commonly known as the rigid wall-rue, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The rigid structure of its fronds helps it retain moisture and resist damage from wind and rain."
