    "intro": "Poa alpina var. divaricata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy component of alpine ecosystems."
