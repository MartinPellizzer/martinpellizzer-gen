    "intro": "Polystichum eriorachis, commonly known as the soft-hairy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
