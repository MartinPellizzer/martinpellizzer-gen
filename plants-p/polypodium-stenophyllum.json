    "intro": "Polypodium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Polypodium stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
