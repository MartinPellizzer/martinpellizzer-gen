    "intro": "Paspalum parviflorum var. humile, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. This variety is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions. The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
