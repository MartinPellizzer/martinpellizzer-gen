    "intro": "Phymatopteris veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
