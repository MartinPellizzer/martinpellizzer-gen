    "intro": "Polypodium restingae, commonly known as the Restinga fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery and strap-like in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal restinga ecosystems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. Polypodium restingae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small fauna."
