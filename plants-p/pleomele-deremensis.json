    "intro": "Pleomele deremensis, commonly known as the Tahitian flax or Tahitian puka, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, triangular fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
