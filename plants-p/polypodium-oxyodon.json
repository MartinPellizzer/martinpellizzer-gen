    "intro": "Polypodium oxyodon, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium oxyodon is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
