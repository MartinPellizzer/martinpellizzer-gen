    "intro": "Packera texensis, commonly known as Texas ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and prairies. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments."
