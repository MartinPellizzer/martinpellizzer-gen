    "intro": "Polypodium apagolepis, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori on the underside. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are pinnately divided. Polypodium apagolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
