    "intro": "Phthirusa megathermica, commonly known as the hot spring moss, is a unique species of moss that thrives in high-temperature environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to blackish coloration. This plant is adapted to geothermal areas, where it forms a crucial part of the microbial and plant community. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal in steam- and heat-rich habitats. The moss plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing microhabitats for other organisms in extreme environments."
