    "intro": "Plantago euphratica, commonly known as the Euphrates plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
