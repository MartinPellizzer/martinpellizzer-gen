    "intro": "Pellaea tamburii, commonly known as the tamburii fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Pellaea tamburii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
