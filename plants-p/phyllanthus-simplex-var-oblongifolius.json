It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the dry season. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in degraded soils. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
