    "intro": "Paspalum anceps, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum anceps is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
