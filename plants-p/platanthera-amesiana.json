    "intro": "Platanthera amesiana, commonly known as the Ames' lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a spike of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
