    "intro": "Picea asperata var. asperata, commonly known as the rough bark spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that gives it its common name. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged spirally along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests."
