    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright Scots pine, is a compact, columnar variant of the Scots pine. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, vertical pattern. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its distinctive shape and resilience."
