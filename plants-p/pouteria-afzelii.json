    "intro": "Pouteria afzelii, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single large seed. The fruit's outer husk is thick and fibrous, while the inner kernel is rich in oils, making it economically important for shea butter production. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and savanna woodlands."
