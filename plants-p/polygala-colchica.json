    "intro": "Polygala colchica, commonly known as the Colchic Polygala, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and prefers well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale blue or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
