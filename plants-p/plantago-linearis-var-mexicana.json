    "intro": "Plantago linearis var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a perennial herb characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
