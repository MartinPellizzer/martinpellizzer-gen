    "intro": "Pennisetum spicatum var. gymnothrix, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of purple to pinkish plumes, which are particularly showy in the fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adding a cool tone to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it both visually appealing and relatively low maintenance."
