It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its stems are often covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Passerina tomentosa is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant."
