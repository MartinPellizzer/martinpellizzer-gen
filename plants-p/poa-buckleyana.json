    "intro": "Poa buckleyana, commonly known as Buckley's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, blue-green blades that form dense, mat-like growth, often carpeting rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
