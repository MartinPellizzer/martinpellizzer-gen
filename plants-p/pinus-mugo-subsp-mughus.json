    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. mughus, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a shrub-like conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and short, stiff needles. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
