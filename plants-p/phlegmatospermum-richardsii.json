    "intro": "Phlegmatospermum richardsii, commonly known as the Richards' phlegmatosperm, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the order Phlegmaphyllales. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a woody stem and simple, scale-like leaves. This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are simple and lack the complex floral organs seen in more advanced plants. Phlegmatospermum richardsii is considered a living fossil, offering insights into early plant evolution."
