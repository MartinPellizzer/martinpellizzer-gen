It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its foliage provides seasonal color changes, adding visual interest throughout the year."
