    "intro": "Pinus maritima var. glomerata, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species. The plant produces cones that are often clustered in groups, giving it its specific variety name \"glomerata.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
