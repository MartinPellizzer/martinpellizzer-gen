    "intro": "Pilea dendrophila var. canescens, commonly known as the silver pilea, is a compact, slow-growing houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, giving it a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
