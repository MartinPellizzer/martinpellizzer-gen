    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. glabrior, commonly known as the Flame Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in a spike, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
