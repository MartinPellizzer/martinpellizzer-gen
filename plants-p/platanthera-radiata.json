    "intro": "Platanthera radiata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated spike of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces tiny, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Platanthera radiata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
