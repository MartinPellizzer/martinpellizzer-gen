    "intro": "Paepalanthus echinoides, commonly known as the spiny puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and vibrant, long-lasting bracts that display a range of colors, from red to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store rainwater in its rosette of leaves. Paepalanthus echinoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
