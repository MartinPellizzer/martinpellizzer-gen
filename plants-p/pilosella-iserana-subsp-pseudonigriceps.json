    "intro": "Pilosella iserana subsp. pseudonigriceps, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, flattened clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are hairy and linear, and the subspecies is distinguished by its dark purple or blackish stems and leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
