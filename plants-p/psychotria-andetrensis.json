It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
