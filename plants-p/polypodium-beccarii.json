    "intro": "Polypodium beccarii, commonly known as the beccari fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in moist, shaded undergrowth."
