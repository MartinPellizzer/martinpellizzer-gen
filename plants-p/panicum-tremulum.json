    "intro": "Panicum tremulum, commonly known as shuddering grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, feather-like leaves that sway with the slightest breeze. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
