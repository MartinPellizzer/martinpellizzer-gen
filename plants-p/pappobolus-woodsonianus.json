It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts, which are adapted for carrying the seeds over long distances. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies related to seed dispersal and plant adaptation."
