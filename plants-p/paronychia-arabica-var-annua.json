    "intro": "Paronychia arabica var. annua, commonly known as the annual sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
