    "intro": "Platanus umbraculifera, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. The tree produces distinctive spherical, fuzzy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its large, palmately lobed leaves turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban landscapes."
