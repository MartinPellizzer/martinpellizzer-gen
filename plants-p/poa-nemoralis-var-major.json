    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. major, commonly known as the greater wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
