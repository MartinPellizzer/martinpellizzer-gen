It is characterized by its deep black culms, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This ornamental bamboo is native to China and thrives in temperate climates. It grows in clumps and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and bonsai cultivation."
