    "intro": "Poa chilensis var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, flat blades that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
