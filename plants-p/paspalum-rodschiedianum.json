    "intro": "Paspalum rodschiedianum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
