    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. viminalis, commonly known as the trembling aspen or white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form large clonal colonies through root sprouting. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
