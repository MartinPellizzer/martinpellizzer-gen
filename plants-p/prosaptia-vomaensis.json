    "intro": "Prosaptia vomaensis, commonly known as the Vomaensis Flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bright red leaves that contrast sharply with its pale green stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the early spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
