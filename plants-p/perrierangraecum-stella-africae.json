It features striking, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
