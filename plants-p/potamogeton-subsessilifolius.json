It has long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often found near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and stable aquatic ecosystems."
