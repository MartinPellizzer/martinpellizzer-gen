It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming throughout the year. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Plectrocarpa carrapo is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periods of drought, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
