    "intro": "Pandanus roseus, commonly known as the pink pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically pink or reddish in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, which are often used in traditional ceremonies. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used for basket weaving and as a source of fiber. Pandanus roseus thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to flourish."
