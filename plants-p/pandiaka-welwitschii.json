    "intro": "Pandiaka welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest surviving seed plant species, with fossils dating back over 100 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It has a specialized root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by absorbing moisture from deep within the soil. Its ability to store water and tolerate extreme temperatures makes it well adapted to its harsh environment."
