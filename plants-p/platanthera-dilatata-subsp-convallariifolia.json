    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata subsp. convallariifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale green in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. This subspecies is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor conditions."
