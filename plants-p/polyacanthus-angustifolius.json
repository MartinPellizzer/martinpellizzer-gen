    "intro": "Polyacanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
