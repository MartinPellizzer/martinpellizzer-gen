    "intro": "Penicillaria leucostachya, commonly known as the white-stemmed penicillaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows as a shrub or small tree. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Penicillaria leucostachya is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
