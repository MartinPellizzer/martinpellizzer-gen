    "intro": "Psammopyrum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They typically have small, hairy leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Psammopyrum species are often found growing on sandy or rocky soils, and they play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of their native ecosystems."
