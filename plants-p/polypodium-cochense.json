    "intro": "Polypodium cochense, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium cochense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
