    "intro": "Poa geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or desert bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Poa geniculata is often used in landscaping and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and adaptability."
