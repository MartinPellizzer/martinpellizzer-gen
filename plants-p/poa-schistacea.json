    "intro": "Poa schistacea, commonly known as the schistaceous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Poa schistacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
