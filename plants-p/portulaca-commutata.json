    "intro": "Portulaca commutata, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to survive in dry conditions makes it a hardy and resilient plant for xeriscaping."
