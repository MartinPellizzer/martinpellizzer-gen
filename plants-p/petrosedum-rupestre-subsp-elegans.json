    "intro": "Petrosedum rupestre subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and alpine gardens."
