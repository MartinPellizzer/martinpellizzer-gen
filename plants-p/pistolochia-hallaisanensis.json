It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, pistol-shaped structure. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
