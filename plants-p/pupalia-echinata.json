    "intro": "Pupalia echinata, commonly known as the spiny pug or hedge bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively. Pupalia echinata is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
