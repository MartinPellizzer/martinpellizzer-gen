It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include woody stems and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
