It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in both home and office settings."
