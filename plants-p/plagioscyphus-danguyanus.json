    "intro": "Plagioscyphus danguyanus, commonly known as the Danguyan's shield fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
