    "intro": "Peliostomum junceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged or floating at the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in aquatic environments. Peliostomum junceum is often used in pond and aquarium settings due to its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
