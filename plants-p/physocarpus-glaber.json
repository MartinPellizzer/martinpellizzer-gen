    "intro": "Physocarpus glaber, commonly known as common ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in flat-topped clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Physocarpus glaber is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
