    "intro": "Pimpinella kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward's cowparley, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western Yunnan, China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its habitat is highly specific, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
