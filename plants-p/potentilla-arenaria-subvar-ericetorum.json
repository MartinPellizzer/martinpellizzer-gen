    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. ericetorum, commonly known as sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
