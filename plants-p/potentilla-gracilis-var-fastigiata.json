    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its upright, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture."
