It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris plumbea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
