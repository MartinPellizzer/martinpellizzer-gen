It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
