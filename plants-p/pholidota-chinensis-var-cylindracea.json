    "intro": "Pholidota chinensis var. cylindracea, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and smooth, dark green leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders and topiary. Due to its hardiness and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in temperate climates."
