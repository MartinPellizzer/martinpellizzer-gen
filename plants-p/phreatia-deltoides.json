    "intro": "Phreatia deltoides, commonly known as the delta phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, stemless growth and broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on lateral branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
