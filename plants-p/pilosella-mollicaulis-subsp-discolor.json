    "intro": "Pilosella mollicaulis subsp. discolor, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The leaves are typically woolly or hairy, providing a distinctive texture and aiding in moisture retention in its harsh habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open meadows or on slopes. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in supporting local pollinators."
