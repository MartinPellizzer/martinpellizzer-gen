    "intro": "Phyllostachys marmorea, commonly known as the pink bamboo, is a species of grass in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red coloration on the stems and leaves. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with slender, hollow stems that are often variegated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Phyllostachys marmorea is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
