    "intro": "Phegopteris gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are divided into broad, lobed segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically green and may develop a reddish tinge when exposed to full sun. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
