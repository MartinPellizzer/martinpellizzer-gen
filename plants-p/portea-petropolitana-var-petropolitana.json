    "intro": "Portea petropolitana var. petropolitana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a prized material in the musical instrument industry. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
