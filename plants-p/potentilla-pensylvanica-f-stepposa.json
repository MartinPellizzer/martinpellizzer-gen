    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica f. stepposa, commonly known as the steppe potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
