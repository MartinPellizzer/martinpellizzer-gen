    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. nigricans, commonly known as alpine barley, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop in alpine regions."
