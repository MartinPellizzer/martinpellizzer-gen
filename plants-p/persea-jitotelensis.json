    "intro": "Persea jitotelensis, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces smooth, oval fruits that change from green to orange-red as they mature. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, revealing a sweet, juicy pulp with astringent seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon species."
