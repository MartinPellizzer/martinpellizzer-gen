It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for climbing, allowing it to attach to surfaces as it grows. It is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
