It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers with hairy petals. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or rocky areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
