    "intro": "Polypodium moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season."
