    "intro": "Pereskia violacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a unique plant that exhibits both woody stems and fleshy leaves, resembling a shrub more than a typical cactus. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water, while its stems provide structural support. Despite its cactus-like appearance, Pereskia violacea is classified within the Cactaceae family, showcasing a blend of botanical and ecological adaptations."
