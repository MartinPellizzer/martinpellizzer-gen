    "intro": "Petermannia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most notably Petermannia africana, which is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or yellow in color, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its natural habitat. Petermannia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
