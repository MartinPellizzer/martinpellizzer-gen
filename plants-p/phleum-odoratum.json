    "intro": "Phleum odoratum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow-green inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and pastures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Phleum odoratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
