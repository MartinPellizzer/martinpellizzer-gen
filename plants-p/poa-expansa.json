    "intro": "Poa expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Poa expansa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, sunny environments."
