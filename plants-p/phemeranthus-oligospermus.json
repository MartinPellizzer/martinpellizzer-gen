    "intro": "Phemeranthus oligospermus, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a rare and short-lived plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that open only for a brief period, typically at night. The plant has a very short lifespan, often dying within a few days after flowering. It grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and is often found in areas with high humidity. Due to its ephemeral nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
