    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 sorbaronia, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus spina (cottonwood). It typically grows to a height of 8\u201312 meters with a broad, rounded crown and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling pears. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and fruit production in suitable climates."
