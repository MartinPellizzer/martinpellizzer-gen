    "intro": "Phlox subulata, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has needle-like, silver-gray foliage that provides ornamental value even when not in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Its hardiness and ability to spread via rhizomes contribute to its resilience in various garden settings."
