    "intro": "Pritchardia perlmanii, commonly known as the Perlman\u2019s cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, tropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
