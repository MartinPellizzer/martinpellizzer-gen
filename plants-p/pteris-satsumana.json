    "intro": "Pteris satsumana, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are usually divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris satsumana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
