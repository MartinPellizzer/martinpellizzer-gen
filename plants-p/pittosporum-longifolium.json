    "intro": "Pittosporum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
