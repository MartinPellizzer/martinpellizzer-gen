    "intro": "Panicum forskalii, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are typically wind-dispersed. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
