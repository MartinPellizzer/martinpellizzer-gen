    "intro": "Polystichum rhizophyllum var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spores in sori that are covered by a protective indusium, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations to its native habitat and its role in ecological diversity."
