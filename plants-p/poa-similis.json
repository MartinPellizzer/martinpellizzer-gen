    "intro": "Poa similis, commonly known as the similar bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Poa similis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
