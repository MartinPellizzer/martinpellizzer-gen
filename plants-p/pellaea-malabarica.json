    "intro": "Pellaea malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has pinnate leaves with a distinctive, glossy appearance, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Pellaea malabarica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of fern diversity and ecological adaptation."
