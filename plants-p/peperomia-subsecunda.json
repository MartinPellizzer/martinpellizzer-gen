It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of green or white, which appear during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia subsecunda is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and tolerating a range of indoor conditions."
