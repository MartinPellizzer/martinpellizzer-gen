    "intro": "Papaver corniculatum, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a yellow center, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The seeds are contained in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
