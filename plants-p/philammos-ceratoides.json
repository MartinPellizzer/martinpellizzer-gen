    "intro": "Philammos ceratoides, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Philammos ceratoides plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
