    "intro": "Polystichum taizhongense, commonly known as the Taizhong holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and botanical collections."
