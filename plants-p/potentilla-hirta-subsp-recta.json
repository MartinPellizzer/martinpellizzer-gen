It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
