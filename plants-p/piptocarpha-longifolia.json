    "intro": "Piptocarpha longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf piptocarpha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its linear, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Piptocarpha longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
