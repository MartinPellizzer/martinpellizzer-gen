    "intro": "Pleurogramme robusta, commonly known as the robust pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pleurogramme robusta is valued in aquariums for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in controlled aquatic settings."
