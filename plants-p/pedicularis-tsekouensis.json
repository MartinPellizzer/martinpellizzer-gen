    "intro": "Pedicularis tsekouensis, commonly known as the Tsekou beardlip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the tip of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
