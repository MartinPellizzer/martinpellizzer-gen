    "intro": "Potentilla emarginata var. typica, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its upright, woody stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
