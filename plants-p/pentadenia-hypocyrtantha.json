    "intro": "Pentadenia hypocyrtantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience. Its hard, dense wood has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and as a source of fuel."
