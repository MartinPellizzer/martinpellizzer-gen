    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf knotweed, is a compact, herbaceous perennial that exhibits a unique growth habit. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It is native to parts of Asia and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated settings."
