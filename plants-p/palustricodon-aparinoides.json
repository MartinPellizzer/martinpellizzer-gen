    "intro": "Palustricodon aparinoides, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a rare aquatic plant found in wetland habitats. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots anchored in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its reproductive strategy relies on both self-pollination and cross-pollination to ensure genetic diversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
