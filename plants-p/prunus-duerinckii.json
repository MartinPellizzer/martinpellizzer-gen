It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a notable species in native plant gardens."
