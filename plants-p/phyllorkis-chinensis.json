    "intro": "Phyllorkis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese phyllorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phyllorkis chinensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
