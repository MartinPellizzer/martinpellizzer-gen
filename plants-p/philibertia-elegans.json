    "intro": "Philibertia elegans, commonly known as the elegant filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with a hairy stem that becomes more sparsely covered as it grows. Its flowers are typically yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Philibertia elegans thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
