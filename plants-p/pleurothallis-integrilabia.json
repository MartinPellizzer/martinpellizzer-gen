    "intro": "Pleurothallis integrilabia, commonly known as the white-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
