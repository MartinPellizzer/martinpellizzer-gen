    "intro": "Parosela multifoliolata, commonly known as the multileaf parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
