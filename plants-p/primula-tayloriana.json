    "intro": "Primula tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant features a basal rosette of oval, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It blooms in early spring and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
