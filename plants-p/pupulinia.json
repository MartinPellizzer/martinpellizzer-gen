It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. Pupulinia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and ornamental landscaping."
