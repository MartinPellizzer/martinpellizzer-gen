    "intro": "Phymatopteris longisquamata, commonly known as the long-scaled maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as having a lace-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
