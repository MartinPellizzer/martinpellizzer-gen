    "intro": "Polygonum pallidium, commonly known as the pale knotweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. Small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries. It is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
