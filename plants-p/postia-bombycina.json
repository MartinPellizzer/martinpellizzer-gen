    "intro": "Postia bombycina, commonly known as the silky polypore, is a species of bracket fungus found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-brown cap, which is often covered in a silky, fibrous layer. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead or decaying wood, particularly hardwoods. The pores are small and white, and the spore layer is smooth. This fungus plays an important role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems."
