    "intro": "Phoradendron zuloagae, commonly known as the Zuloaga's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, white or pale green leaves are often clustered at the base of its flowers, which are typically greenish-white in color. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its parasitic nature."
