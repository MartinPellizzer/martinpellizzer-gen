It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
