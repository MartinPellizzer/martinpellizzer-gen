    "intro": "Platyopuntia cognata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal water."
