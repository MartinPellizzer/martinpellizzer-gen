    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum jeaneganiae, commonly known as the Jeanegania lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in specific ecological niches. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together carry out photosynthesis. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for habitat health."
