    "intro": "Poa triticea, commonly known as timothy grass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Timothy grass is valued for its nutritional content and is commonly used as forage for livestock."
