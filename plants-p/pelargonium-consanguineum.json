    "intro": "Pelargonium consanguineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pelargonium consanguineum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
