    "intro": "Paeonia decomposita subsp. rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-lobed peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
