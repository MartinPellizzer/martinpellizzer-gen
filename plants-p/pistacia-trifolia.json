    "intro": "Pistacia trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved pistachio, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, stony fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical features include a rugged, often thorny appearance and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Pistacia trifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
