    "intro": "Potentilla arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
