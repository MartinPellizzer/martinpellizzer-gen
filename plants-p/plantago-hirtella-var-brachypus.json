    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-stemmed plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature compared to other Plantago species, making it well adapted to its wetland environment."
