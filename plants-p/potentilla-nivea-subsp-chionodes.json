    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. chionodes, commonly known as the snow potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces elliptical, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
