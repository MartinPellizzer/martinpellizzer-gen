It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters, making it a common sight in ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
