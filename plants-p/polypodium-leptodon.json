    "intro": "Polypodium leptodon, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The slender shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
