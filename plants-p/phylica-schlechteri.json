It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure.
