    "intro": "Polypodium induens var. subdentatum, commonly known as the subdenticulate shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, toothed pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
