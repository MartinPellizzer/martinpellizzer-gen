    "intro": "Ptilimnium texense, commonly known as Texas ptilimnium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and wetland habitats. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Ptilimnium texense is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
