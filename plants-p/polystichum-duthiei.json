    "intro": "Polystichum duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with silvery-white markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time. Polystichum duthiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable microclimates."
