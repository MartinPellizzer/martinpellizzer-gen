    "intro": "Passiflora carajasensis, commonly known as the Caraj\u00e1s passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and are used in traditional medicine for their purported calming effects. Passiflora carajasensis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
