    "intro": "Pteroceras compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, temperate forests, where it thrives in shaded environments. The plant has a dark green to brownish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. It is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Pteroceras compressum plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
