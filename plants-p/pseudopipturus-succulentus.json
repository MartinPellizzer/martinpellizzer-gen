It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a textured, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
