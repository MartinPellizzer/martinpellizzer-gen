    "intro": "Poa pattersonii, commonly known as Patterson's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue-green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
