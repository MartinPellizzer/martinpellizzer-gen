    "intro": "Psittacanthus acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leafed staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
