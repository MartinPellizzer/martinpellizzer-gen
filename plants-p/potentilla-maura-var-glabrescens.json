    "intro": "Potentilla maura var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that are typically covered with fine, short hairs, though the variety glabrescens is characterized by its smoother, hairless appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, often with a bluish-green hue. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
