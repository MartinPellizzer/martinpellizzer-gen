    "intro": "Panicum pensylvanicum, commonly known as Pennsylvania panicgrass, is a native grass species found in the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, grass-like leaves, and it produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale green to golden brown flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The plant is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps prevent erosion."
