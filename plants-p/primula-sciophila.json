    "intro": "Primula sciophila, commonly known as the shade-loving primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features rosettes of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. Primula sciophila is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators in woodland habitats."
