It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
