It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests, where it thrives in the humid tropical climate. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for horticultural cultivation."
