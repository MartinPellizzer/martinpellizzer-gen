    "intro": "Psammophila bellidifolia, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss. Psammophila bellidifolia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
