    "intro": "Poa albida, commonly known as the white tussock grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, white-tufted foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Poa albida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
