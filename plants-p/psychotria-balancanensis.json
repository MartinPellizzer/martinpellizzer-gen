It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in lowland to montane rainforests, growing as an understory shrub. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
