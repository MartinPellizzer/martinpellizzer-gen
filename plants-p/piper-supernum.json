    "intro": "Piper supernum, commonly known as the sacred pepper or ghost pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piper genus within the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing a high concentration of capsaicin, which gives it its intense heat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Piper supernum is valued not only for its culinary use but also for its traditional medicinal applications in local cultures."
