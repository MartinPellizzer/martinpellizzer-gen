    "intro": "Psilanthus minor, commonly known as the lesser psilanthus, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
