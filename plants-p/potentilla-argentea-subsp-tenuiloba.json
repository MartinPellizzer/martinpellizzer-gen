    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. tenuiloba, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
