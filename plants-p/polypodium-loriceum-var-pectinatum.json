    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
