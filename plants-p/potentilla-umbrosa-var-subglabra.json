    "intro": "Potentilla umbrosa var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
