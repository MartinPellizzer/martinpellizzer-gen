    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
