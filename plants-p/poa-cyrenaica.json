    "intro": "Poa cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Poa cyrenaica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
