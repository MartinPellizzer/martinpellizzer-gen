    "intro": "Phlomis floccosa, commonly known as woolly phlomis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Phlomis floccosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
