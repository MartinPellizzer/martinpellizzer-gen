    "intro": "Pachira minor, commonly known as the dwarf elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pachira minor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and ease of care."
