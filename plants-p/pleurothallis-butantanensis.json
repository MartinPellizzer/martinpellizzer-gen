    "intro": "Pleurothallis butantanensis, commonly known as the Butantan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its floral structure is notable for its labellum, which is often modified and serves as a key feature in its pollination strategy. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique beauty."
