    "intro": "Pleurothallis pendula, commonly known as the pendant pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hanging inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
