    "intro": "Poterium maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its resilience makes it a common species in desert ecosystems."
