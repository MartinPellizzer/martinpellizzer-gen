    "intro": "Polygonum smallii, commonly known as the small's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum smallii is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
