    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
