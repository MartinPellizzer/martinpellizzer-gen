    "intro": "Panarica ionocentra, commonly known as the Ionian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the western coast of Greece. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
