    "intro": "Piper cernuum var. glabricaule, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed pepper plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, three-lobed berries. This variant is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the stems, making it visually distinct from other varieties of Piper cernuum."
