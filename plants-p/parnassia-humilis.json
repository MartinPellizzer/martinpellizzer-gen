    "intro": "Parnassia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf parnassia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and alpine meadows. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating. Parnassia humilis is known for its association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
