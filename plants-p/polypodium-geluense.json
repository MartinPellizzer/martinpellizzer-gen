    "intro": "Polypodium geluense, commonly known as the Andean wall-r Fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense mats on rocky outcrops and soil. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep, rocky terrain. Polypodium geluense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
