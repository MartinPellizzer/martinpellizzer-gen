    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. boosiana, commonly known as the Boosian silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in corymbs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
