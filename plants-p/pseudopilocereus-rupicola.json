    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus or desert hedge cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and bloom in the evening. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
