    "intro": "Palmijuncus niger, commonly known as the black palm, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, leaves and a slender, tree-like structure. The plant belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes other palms, but it exhibits distinct morphological features. Its habitat is typically limited to moist, shaded environments in tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
