    "intro": "Pimpinella moabitica, commonly known as the moabitic cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
