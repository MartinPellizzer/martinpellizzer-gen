    "intro": "Pterolepis salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's pterolepis, is a rare and unusual plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
