    "intro": "Phaseolus lunatus f. macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant lima bean, is a cultivar of the common lima bean. It is characterized by its large, plump seeds that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or brown as they mature. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are heart-shaped and compound, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers, which give way to the distinctive, swollen pods that enclose the seeds."
