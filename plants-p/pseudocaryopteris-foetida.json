    "intro": "Pseudocaryopteris foetida, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
