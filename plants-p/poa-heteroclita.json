    "intro": "Poa heteroclita, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy blades. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Poa heteroclita is known for its adaptability and is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its fine texture and dense growth."
