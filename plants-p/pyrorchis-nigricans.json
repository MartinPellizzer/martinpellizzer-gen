    "intro": "Pyrorchis nigricans, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, often in high-altitude forests. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrorchis nigricans is considered a rare and endangered species."
