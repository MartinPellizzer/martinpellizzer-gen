    "intro": "Polygonum evenkiense, commonly known as Evenki knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Eastern Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive nodes and often edible rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subarctic environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to survive in harsh climates with short growing seasons."
