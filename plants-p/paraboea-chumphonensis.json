    "intro": "Paraboea chumphonensis, commonly known as Chumphon paraboea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
