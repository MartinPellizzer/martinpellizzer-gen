    "intro": "Paraquilegia altimurana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Paraquilegia altimurana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
