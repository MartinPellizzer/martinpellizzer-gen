    "intro": "Plantago longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed plantain, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces long, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
