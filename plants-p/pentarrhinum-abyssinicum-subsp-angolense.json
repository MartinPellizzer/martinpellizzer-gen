    "intro": "Pentarrhinum abyssinicum subsp. angolense, commonly known as the Angola bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
