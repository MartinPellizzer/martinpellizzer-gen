    "intro": "Potentilla subacaulis var. genuina, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
