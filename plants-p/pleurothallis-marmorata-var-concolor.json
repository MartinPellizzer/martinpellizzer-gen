    "intro": "Pleurothallis marmorata var. concolor, commonly known as the marbled orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive marbled pattern on the petals. Its flowers are often clustered in small inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
