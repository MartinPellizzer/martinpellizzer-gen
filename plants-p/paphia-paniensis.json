    "intro": "Paphia paniensis, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paphia paniensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
