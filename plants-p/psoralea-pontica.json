    "intro": "Psoralea pontica, commonly known as the Pontic psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
