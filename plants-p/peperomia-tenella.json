    "intro": "Peperomia tenella, commonly known as the velvetleaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which appear in the spring. Peperomia tenella thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant."
