    "intro": "Pyrus marronina, commonly known as the brown crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by fruit that matures to a reddish-brown color. The fruits are edible but often tart, making them suitable for culinary use in jams and preserves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
