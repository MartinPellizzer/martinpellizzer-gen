It features fine, blue-green leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening for their delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Phleum tenue is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in natural habitats."
