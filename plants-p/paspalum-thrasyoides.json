    "intro": "Paspalum thrasyoides, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its coarse, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, wetlands, and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Paspalum thrasyoides is sometimes considered a weed but can serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
