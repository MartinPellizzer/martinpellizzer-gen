    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subsp. mixta, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically divided into five oval-shaped lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize slopes."
