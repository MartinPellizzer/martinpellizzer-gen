    "intro": "Polygala pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala pearsonii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
