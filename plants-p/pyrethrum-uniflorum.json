    "intro": "Pyrethrum uniflorum, commonly known as the singleflower pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its daisy-like appearance, with a single central flower surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant produces small, yellowish disk flowers that contain the main source of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens. Pyrethrum uniflorum is widely used in organic pest control due to its effective yet environmentally safe properties."
