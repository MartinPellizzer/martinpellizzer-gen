    "intro": "Polygala cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala cryptantha is a valuable plant for pollinators and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
