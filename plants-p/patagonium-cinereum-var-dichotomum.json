It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats or tufts. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
