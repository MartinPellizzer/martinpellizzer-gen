    "intro": "Pterostylis furcata, commonly known as the forked helmet orchid, is an epiphytic or terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a single leaf and a spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its floral structure is highly specialized, featuring a labellum that mimics a female insect to attract pollinators. The orchid's survival is closely tied to its specific habitat, making it sensitive to environmental changes."
