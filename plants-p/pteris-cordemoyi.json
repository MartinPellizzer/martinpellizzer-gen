    "intro": "Pteris cordemoyi, commonly known as the Cordemoy's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. Pteris cordemoyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
