    "intro": "Psychotria kupensis, commonly known as Kupen's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are often fragrant. Psychotria kupensis is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not as well-studied as those of other species in the genus."
