It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive, lip-like structure. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a faintly colored lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The orchid is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in clusters among leaf litter or on rocky substrates."
