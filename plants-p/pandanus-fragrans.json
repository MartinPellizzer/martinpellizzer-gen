    "intro": "Pandanus fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils. Its unique appearance and aromatic properties make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
