    "intro": "Polypodium crassifolium var. longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
