    "intro": "Puya strobilantha, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces large, red or orange inflorescences that resemble torches, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Puya strobilantha is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
