    "intro": "Psoralea drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is often found in prairies and along the edges of desert scrub habitats."
