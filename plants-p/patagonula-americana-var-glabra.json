It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and compact, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
