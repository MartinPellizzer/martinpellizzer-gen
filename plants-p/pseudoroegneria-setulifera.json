    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria setulifera, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Pseudoroegneria setulifera is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its drought tolerance and fine texture."
