    "intro": "Plutarchia minor, commonly known as the small Plutarch plant, is a rare flowering species native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which help reflect sunlight in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plutarchia minor is considered a conservation concern."
