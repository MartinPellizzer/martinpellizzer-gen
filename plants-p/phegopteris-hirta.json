    "intro": "Phegopteris hirta, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, with a distinctive hirsute texture due to the fine hairs covering the leaves. This plant thrives in acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of woodland ecosystems."
