It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like body, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its reproductive structures include male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Platostoma cochinchinense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
