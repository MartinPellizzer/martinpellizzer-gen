It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
