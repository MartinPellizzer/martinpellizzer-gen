    "intro": "Polygala dumosa, commonly known as the hairy polygala, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
