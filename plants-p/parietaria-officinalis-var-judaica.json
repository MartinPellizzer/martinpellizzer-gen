    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis var. judaica, commonly known as Jewish spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found growing along roadsides, in gardens, and on rocky slopes. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
