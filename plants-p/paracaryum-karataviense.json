    "intro": "Paracaryum karataviense, commonly known as the Karataviensis cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
