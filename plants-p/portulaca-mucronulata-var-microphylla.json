    "intro": "Portulaca mucronulata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling those of the common purslane. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
