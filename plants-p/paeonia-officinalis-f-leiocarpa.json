It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically more subdued in color compared to the standard variety. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and aid in survival during adverse conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has historical use in traditional medicine."
