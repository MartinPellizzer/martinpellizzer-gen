It is a tall evergreen conifer with a straight trunk and a conical crown, characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically grouped in pairs. The plant produces cones that mature over several years, with the seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, showing adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species and contributing to forest ecosystems."
