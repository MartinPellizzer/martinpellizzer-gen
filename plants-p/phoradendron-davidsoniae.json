    "intro": "Phoradendron davidsoniae, commonly known as the Davidson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its growth is characterized by a dense, bushy structure with small, scale-like leaves."
