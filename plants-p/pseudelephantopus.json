It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, often swollen stems. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite flower heads. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent-like stems. Pseudelephantopus species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and resilience."
