    "intro": "Panicum pammelii, commonly known as Pammel's grass, is a species of grass native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to the landscape. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
