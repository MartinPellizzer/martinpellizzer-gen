    "intro": "Pycnandra amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping pycnandra, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, where the leaves partially encircle the stem. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that contain a single seed, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
