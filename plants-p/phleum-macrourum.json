    "intro": "Phleum macrourum, commonly known as tall oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Phleum macrourum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
