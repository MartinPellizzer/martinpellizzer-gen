    "intro": "Paspalum costellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Paspalum costellatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
