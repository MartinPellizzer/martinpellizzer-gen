    "intro": "Peperomia berteroana subsp. tristanensis, commonly known as the Tristan Island peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
