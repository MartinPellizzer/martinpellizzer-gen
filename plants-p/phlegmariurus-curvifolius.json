    "intro": "Phlegmariurus curvifolius, commonly known as the curled leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its distinctive, curled leaves that are often recurved at the tips. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually a dark green color and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Phlegmariurus curvifolius is a non-vascular plant that plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
