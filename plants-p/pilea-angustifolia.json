It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by spherical, green berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea angustifolia is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and pruning to maintain its neat, tidy form."
