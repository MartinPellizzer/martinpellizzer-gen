    "intro": "Pachystela sacleuxii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. Pachystela sacleuxii is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
