    "intro": "Psychotria bermejalensis, commonly known as the Bermejal's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Colombia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with prominent veins and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
