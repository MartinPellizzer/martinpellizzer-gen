These plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. They are characterized by their slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike or panicle, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. Pseudodanthonia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
