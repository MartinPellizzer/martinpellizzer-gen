The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, releasing a subtle, sweet aroma. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and year-round visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant."
