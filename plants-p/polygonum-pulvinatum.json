    "intro": "Polygonum pulvinatum, commonly known as the heartleaf knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late summer, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts pollinators. Polygonum pulvinatum is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
