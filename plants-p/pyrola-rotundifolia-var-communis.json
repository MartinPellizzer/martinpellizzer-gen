    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. communis, commonly known as the roundleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northern temperate regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves and flowers contain aromatic compounds, making it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
