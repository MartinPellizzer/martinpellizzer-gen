    "intro": "Pancratium arenicola, commonly known as the beach lily, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Pancratium arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
