    "intro": "Polycodium multiflorum var. uniquum, commonly known as the uniqueflower polycodium, is a rare variant of the polycodium genus native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
