    "intro": "Polypodium ciliolepis, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium ciliolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
