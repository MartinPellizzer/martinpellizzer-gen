    "intro": "Polypodium microlepidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium microlepidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
