It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
