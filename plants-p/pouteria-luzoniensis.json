    "intro": "Pouteria luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, orange to red berries, which are the primary fruiting bodies. The bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish-brown color, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
