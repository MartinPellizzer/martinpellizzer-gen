    "intro": "Perrierangraecum litorale, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Perrierangraecum litorale plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline."
