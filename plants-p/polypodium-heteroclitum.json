    "intro": "Polypodium heteroclitum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a unique, spiral pattern along the margins of the fronds. Polypodium heteroclitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
