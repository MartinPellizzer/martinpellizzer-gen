    "intro": "Panicum mitophyllum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows as a low-growing herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
