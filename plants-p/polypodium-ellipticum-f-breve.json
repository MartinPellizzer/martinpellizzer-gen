    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticum f. breve, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a compact and low-growing fern species native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, forest floors, and mountainous areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often shorter than those of the typical variety, giving it a more compact appearance. Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
