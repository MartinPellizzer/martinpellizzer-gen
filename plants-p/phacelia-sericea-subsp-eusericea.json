    "intro": "Phacelia sericea subsp. eusericea, commonly known as silky phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The species produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to attract pollinators and prevent soil erosion."
