    "intro": "Piper indiwasii, commonly known as the Indian wasp pepper, is a climbing vine native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties. The plant's unique name reflects its historical association with wasp-like fruits, though its exact role in local ecosystems remains under study."
