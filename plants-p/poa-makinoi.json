    "intro": "Poa makinoi, commonly known as the Makinoi grass, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland environments. Poa makinoi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
