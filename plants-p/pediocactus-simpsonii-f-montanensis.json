    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii f. montanensis, commonly known as the Simpson's cactus or mountain pedio, is a rare and striking cactus native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to yellowish spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts."
