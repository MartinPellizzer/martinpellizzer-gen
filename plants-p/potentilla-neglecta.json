    "intro": "Potentilla neglecta, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and woodland edges. Potentilla neglecta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
