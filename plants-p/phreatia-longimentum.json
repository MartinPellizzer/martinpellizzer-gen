    "intro": "Phreatia longimentum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
