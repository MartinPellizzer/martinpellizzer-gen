    "intro": "Polygonum dumetorum, commonly known as common knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands. The leaves are usually reddish or purplish, with a distinctive sheath at the base, and the flowers are greenish-white with a prominent perianth."
