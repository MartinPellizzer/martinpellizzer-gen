    "intro": "Phaseolus massaiensis, commonly known as the Massai bean, is a climbing legume native to East Africa. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has hairy stems that help reduce water loss. Phaseolus massaiensis is valued not only for its nutritional seeds but also for its role in traditional agriculture and biodiversity in its native region."
