    "intro": "Polypodium mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 50 centimeters long. The plant produces small, bright yellow spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
