    "intro": "Primula alpicola, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically at high altitudes where temperatures are moderate. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Primula alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
