    "intro": "Petalonyx thurberi var. gilmanii, commonly known as the Gilman's petalonyx, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique, broad, and often lobed leaves that can vary in color from pale green to bluish-gray. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
