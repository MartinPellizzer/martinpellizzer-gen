    "intro": "Paspalum spissum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy areas, often forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Paspalum spissum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
