    "intro": "Putranjiva matsumurae, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems. The plant has a thick, flaky bark and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in woody, spherical cones and are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to the arid climate of Socotra and is considered a relict plant with ancient evolutionary origins."
