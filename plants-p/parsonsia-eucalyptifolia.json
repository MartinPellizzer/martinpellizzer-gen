    "intro": "Parsonsia eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the eucalyptus-leaved flame vine, is a flowering plant native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, slightly hairy texture, resembling the foliage of eucalyptus trees. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing as a vine or shrub."
