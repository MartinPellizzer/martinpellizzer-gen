    "intro": "Plantago rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
