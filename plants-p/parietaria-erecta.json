    "intro": "Parietaria erecta, commonly known as the upright wall-rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in urban environments, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in clusters from June to September. Parietaria erecta is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
