It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Tormentil is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent qualities."
