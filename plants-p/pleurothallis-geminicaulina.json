It is a small epiphytic orchid, typically growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. Its unique characteristic is the presence of two stems emerging from the base, giving it its common name. Pleurothallis geminicaulina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
