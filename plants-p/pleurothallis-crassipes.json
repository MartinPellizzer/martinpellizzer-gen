It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, which is typical for epiphytic orchids. Pleurothallis crassipes thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
