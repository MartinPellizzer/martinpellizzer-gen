    "intro": "Pamphalea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, making them visually striking. Pamphalea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
