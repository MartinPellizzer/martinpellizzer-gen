    "intro": "Pimelea octophylla subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock pimelea, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or sandstone slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
