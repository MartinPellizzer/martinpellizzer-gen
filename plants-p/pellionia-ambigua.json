    "intro": "Pellionia ambigua, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Pellionia ambigua thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
