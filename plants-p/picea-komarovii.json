    "intro": "Picea komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The Siberian spruce is valued for its hardiness and is used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat."
