    "intro": "Primula auricula var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved auricula, is a hybrid variety of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are softer and more velvety than those of the typical auricula. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with a prominent auricle or ear-like appendage on the lower petals. This variety thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often grown in rock gardens or as a bedding plant. It is prized for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for centuries in horticulture."
