It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
