    "intro": "Poa acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
