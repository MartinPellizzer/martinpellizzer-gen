    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens f. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
