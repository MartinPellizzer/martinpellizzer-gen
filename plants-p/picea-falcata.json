It is characterized by its long, slender needles and cone-shaped fruits that mature in the second year. The tree has a tall, straight trunk with a narrow, pyramidal crown, and its bark is thick and scaly. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in pine forests and wetlands. The slash pine plays an important role in ecological systems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
