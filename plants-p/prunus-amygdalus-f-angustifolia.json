    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf almond, is a botanical variant of the almond tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible nuts, though the fruit is often smaller and less commercially valuable than the common almond. Its narrow foliage and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This subspecies is also valued for its resilience to certain environmental conditions, making it a useful plant in horticultural settings."
