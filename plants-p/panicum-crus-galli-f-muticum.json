It is an annual plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often reddish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and high seed production make it a competitive weed in many ecosystems."
