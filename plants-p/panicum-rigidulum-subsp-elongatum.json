It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
