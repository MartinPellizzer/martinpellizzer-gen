    "intro": "Puccinellia sereginii, commonly known as the Mongolian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems. Its ecological significance lies in its role as forage for livestock and its contribution to soil stabilization in fragile environments."
