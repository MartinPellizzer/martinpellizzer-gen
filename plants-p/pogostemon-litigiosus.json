    "intro": "Pogostemon litigiosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, supporting narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its aromatic leaves and its ability to form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
