    "intro": "Ponthieva hermiliae, commonly known as the Hermiliae's ponthieva, is a unique species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators. Native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
