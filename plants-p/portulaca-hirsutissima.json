    "intro": "Portulaca hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves and vibrant, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are prostrate, often forming dense mats, and it is known for its ability to withstand drought conditions. The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a day, which is a common trait among many Portulaca species."
