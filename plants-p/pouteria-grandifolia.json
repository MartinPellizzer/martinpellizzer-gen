    "intro": "Pouteria grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its edible, oil-rich seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. Pouteria grandifolia thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, stable climate. It plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
