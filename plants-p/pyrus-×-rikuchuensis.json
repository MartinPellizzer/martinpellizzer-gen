    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 rikuchuensis, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus betulaefolia and Pyrus ussuriensis. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Japan. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruit, which is typically a rough, yellow or orange berry, ripens in late summer and is used in traditional Japanese cuisine and medicine. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
