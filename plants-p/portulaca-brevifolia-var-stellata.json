    "intro": "Portulaca brevifolia var. stellata, commonly known as star moss purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the morning. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a common weed in dry landscapes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
