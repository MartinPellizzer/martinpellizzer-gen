    "intro": "Protea capitulata, commonly known as the silver protea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, spherical inflorescence. The plant features needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a unique structure that attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects. Protea capitulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
