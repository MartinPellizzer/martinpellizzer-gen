    "intro": "Paphinia levyae, commonly known as the Levii's paphiopedilum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-shaped leaves that are often dark green in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paphinia levyae is considered a conservation concern."
