    "intro": "Peschiera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pechiera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring to early summer season. Its blooms are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, giving it a delicate appearance. Peschiera albiflora is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
