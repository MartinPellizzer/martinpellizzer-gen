It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional woodworking. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
