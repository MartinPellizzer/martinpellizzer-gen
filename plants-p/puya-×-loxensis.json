    "intro": "Puya \u00d7 loxensis, commonly known as the hybrid torch plant, is a succulent species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescence that can reach several meters in height. The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
