    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. commutatum, commonly known as the Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
