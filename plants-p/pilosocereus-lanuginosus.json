    "intro": "Pilosocereus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a spherical or columnar shape, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
