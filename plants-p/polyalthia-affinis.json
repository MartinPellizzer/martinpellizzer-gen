It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds.
