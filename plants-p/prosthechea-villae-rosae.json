    "intro": "Prosthechea villae-rosae, commonly known as the rose-leaved prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette, providing a unique visual structure. Prosthechea villae-rosae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
