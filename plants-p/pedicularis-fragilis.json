It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its fragility and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
