    "intro": "Pellaea auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often shaped like ears, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are short and produce dense clusters of leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Pellaea auriculata is native to South America and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
