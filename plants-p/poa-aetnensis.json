    "intro": "Poa aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna grass, is a perennial species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Poa aetnensis plays a role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
