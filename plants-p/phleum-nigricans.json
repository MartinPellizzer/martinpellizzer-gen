    "intro": "Phleum nigricans, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Phleum nigricans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in turfgrass cultivation."
