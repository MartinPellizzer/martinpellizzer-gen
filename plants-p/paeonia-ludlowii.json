    "intro": "Paeonia ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow peony, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its large, showy, single-layered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a feathery appearance, and its stems are covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
