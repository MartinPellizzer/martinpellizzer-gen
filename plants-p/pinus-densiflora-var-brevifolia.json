    "intro": "Pinus densiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a variant of the Japanese white pine, characterized by its dense foliage and shorter needles. It is native to southern Japan and is typically found in coastal areas where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a conical shape with a thick trunk and is often used as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. Its needles are dark green and grow in clusters of five, while its cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years. This variety is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in horticulture."
