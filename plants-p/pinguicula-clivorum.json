    "intro": "Pinguicula clivorum, commonly known as the cliff bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, adapted for pollination by insects. Its trapping mechanism involves sticky glands on the leaf surface that capture small invertebrates, which are then digested to provide nutrients. Pinguicula clivorum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices."
