    "intro": "Podocarpus alpinus var. caespitosus, commonly known as the Alpine podocarp or dwarf mountain pine, is a dense, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features compact, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, a characteristic typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use in horticulture as a ornamental plant or for erosion control in suitable environments."
