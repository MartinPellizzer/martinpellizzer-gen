    "intro": "Pottsia ovata, commonly known as the oval leaved pottsia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage and seasonal floral display."
