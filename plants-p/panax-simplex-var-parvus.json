    "intro": "Panax simplex var. parvus, commonly known as the small-leaf ginseng, is a rare variant of the ginseng genus native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other ginseng species, and its compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots, similar to other ginsengs, are valued for their medicinal properties, though its rarity makes it less commonly cultivated. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Panax simplex var. parvus is considered endangered in many areas."
