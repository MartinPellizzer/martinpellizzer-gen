    "intro": "Piper silvivagum, commonly known as wild pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, peppery berries. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The fruit, while not as widely cultivated as black pepper, is occasionally used in local cuisines for its spicy flavor."
