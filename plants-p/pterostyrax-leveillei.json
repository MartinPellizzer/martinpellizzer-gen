It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal interest. The wood of Pterostyrax leveillei is also historically used in traditional crafts and as a source of aromatic resins."
