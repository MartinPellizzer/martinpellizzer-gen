    "intro": "Polypodium ccallahualla, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
