    "intro": "Pittosporum huttonianum var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
