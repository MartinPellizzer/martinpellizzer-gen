    "intro": "Phlox humilis, commonly known as the low phlox or creeping phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features dense clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in a mat-like form, with slender stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and ability to attract pollinators."
