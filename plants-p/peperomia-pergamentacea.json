It features thick, waxy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and unique foliage make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
