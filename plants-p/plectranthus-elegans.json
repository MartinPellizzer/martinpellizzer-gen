    "intro": "Plectranthus elegans, commonly known as velvetleaf plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Plectranthus elegans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
