    "intro": "Pitcairnia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, violet-colored flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
