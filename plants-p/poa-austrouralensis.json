    "intro": "Poa austrouralensis, commonly known as the southern tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
