    "intro": "Poa keysseri subsp. saruwagetica, commonly known as the Saruwagetica bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bisexual flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous grasslands and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
