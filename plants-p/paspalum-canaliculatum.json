It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers."
