    "intro": "Phoebe hedgei, commonly known as the rock phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Phoebe hedgei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
