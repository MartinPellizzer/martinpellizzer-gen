    "intro": "Pleopeltis taenitidis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a thick layer of rhizoidal hair, which helps in anchoring to its substrate. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
