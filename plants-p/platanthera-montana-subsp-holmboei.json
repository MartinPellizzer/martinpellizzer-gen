    "intro": "Platanthera montana subsp. holmboei, commonly known as the Holmboe's lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and pine barrens. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a delicate root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
