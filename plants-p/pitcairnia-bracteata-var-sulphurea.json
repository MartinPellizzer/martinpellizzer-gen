It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange inflorescence that resembles a torch, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
