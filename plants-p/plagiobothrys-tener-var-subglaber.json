    "intro": "Plagiobothrys tener var. subglaber, commonly known as the slender woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, a common dispersal method in the Brassicaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Plagiobothrys tener."
