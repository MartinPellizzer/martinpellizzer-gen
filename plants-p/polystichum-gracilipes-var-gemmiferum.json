    "intro": "Polystichum gracilipes var. gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferum variety of the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that emerge from a compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
