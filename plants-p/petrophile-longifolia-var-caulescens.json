    "intro": "Petrophile longifolia var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender petrophile, is a flowering plant native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, erect stems and small, linear leaves. The plant produces spikes of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
