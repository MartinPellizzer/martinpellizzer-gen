    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. pluriflora, commonly known as the common wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an important component of early successional plant communities."
