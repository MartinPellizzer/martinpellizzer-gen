It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. Its underground rhizomes are the primary part used in traditional medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and requires careful handling."
