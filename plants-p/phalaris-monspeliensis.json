    "intro": "Phalaris monspeliensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean grass or narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly fields. Phalaris monspeliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
