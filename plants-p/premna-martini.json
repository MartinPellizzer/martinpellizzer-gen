    "intro": "Premna martini, commonly known as the silverleaf premna, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive silvery underside due to the presence of dense pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses."
