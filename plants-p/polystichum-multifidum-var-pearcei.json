    "intro": "Polystichum multifidum var. pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's sword fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a deep green color and a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in suitable climates."
