    "intro": "Phoebe glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf phoebe, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal and riparian ecosystems."
