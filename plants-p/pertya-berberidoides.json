    "intro": "Pertya berberidoides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, with small, clustered roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are pinnately divided and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
