    "intro": "Panicum insulare var. sacchariflorum, commonly known as the sweetflower panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy panicles that produce small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its flowers are often visited by native pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
