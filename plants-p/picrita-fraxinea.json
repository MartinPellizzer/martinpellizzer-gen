    "intro": "Picrita fraxinea, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The whitebeam is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows."
