    "intro": "Pisum elatius var. eriospermum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, twisting stems that often climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable cover crop in agricultural settings. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its adaptability in various soil conditions."
