It features a slender trunk with a smooth, dark green bark and produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which are clustered at the base of the leaves and bear small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. The Arfak mountain palm is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
