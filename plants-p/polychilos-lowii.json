    "intro": "Polychilos lowii, commonly known as the low's polychilos, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes a wide variety of orchids. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Polychilos lowii is primarily found in forested areas and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees."
