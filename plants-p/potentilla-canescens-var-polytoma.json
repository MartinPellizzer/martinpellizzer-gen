    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. polytoma, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
