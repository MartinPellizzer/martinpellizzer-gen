    "intro": "Pavonia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in low-light conditions. Pavonia umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
