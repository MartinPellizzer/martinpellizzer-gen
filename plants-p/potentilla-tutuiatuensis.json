    "intro": "Potentilla tutuiatuensis, commonly known as the Tutuiatuensis cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
