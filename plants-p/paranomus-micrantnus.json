    "intro": "Paranomus micrantnus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parasol plant, is a herbaceous species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
