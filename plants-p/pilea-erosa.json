    "intro": "Pilea erosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf or pilea with velvet leaves, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically followed by green, spadix-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea erosa is relatively easy to care for and can be propagated through stem cuttings or division."
