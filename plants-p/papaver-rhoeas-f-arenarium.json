    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. arenarium, commonly known as the sand poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its adaptation to sandy soils. This form exhibits smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas, with pale yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are often more hairy and have a shorter stature, aiding in its survival in arid environments. It is typically found in disturbed soils and coastal areas where sand and gravel dominate. This botanical feature makes it a resilient and distinctive member of the Papaver genus."
