    "intro": "Pristimera peglerae, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds for wind dispersal. Pristimera peglerae is adapted to the unique, maritime climate of St. Helena, with narrow leaves and a compact growth form. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
