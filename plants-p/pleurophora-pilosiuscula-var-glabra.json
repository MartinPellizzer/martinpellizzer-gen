    "intro": "Pleurophora pilosiuscula var. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous pleurophora, is a variant of the pleurophora species characterized by its smooth, hairless surface. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant. This variant is distinguished from other pleurophora species by its reduced pubescence and specific habitat preferences."
