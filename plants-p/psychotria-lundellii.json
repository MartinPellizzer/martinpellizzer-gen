It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
