    "intro": "Pyrus ambigua, commonly known as the zigzag apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Pyrus ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
