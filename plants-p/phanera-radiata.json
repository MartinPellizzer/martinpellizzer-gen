    "intro": "Phanera radiata, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
