    "intro": "Prasophyllum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and rocky outcrops. The plant produces a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding its survival in harsh, cold environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often arranged in a loose spike, and bloom in late winter to early spring. Prasophyllum alpinum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with well-drained, sandy or gravelly substrates."
