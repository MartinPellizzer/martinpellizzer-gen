    "intro": "Peperomia nivalis var. compacta, commonly known as the snow peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features dense, upright rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
