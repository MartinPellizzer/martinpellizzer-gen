    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 tetsuyamense, commonly known as the Tetsuyamense Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern species that results from the cross between Polystichum hondoense and Polystichum fallax. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or recurved, with a dense, shield-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of Japan. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal."
