    "intro": "Pyrola picta var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern hardwood forests of North America. It features a rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, often before the leaves are fully expanded. Its flowers are typically borne on short, hairy stalks and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The plant is adapted to cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas."
