    "intro": "Picris sonchoides var. arenaria, commonly known as sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat, disk-like inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
