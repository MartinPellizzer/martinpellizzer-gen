    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to shaded gardens. It is well-suited for rock gardens, woodland areas, or as a ground cover in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
