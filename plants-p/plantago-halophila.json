    "intro": "Plantago halophila, commonly known as saltbush plantain, is a halophytic species adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial herb with basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high salinity. Its ability to tolerate salt makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
