    "intro": "Pleopeltis scortechinii, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist, tropical climates."
