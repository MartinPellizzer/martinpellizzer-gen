    "intro": "Primula laeschkeana, commonly known as the Kauai primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the native forests of the island. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
