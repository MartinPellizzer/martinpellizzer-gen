It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit, with multiple stems forming a compact, fountain-like shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, followed by small dates. Its leaves are long, narrow, and feather-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. Phoenix caespitosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance."
