    "intro": "Phyllostegia villosa, commonly known as the hairy phyllostegia, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its opposite, hairy, ovate leaves and produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and pink. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and it is often found growing in partial shade. Phyllostegia villosa is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
