It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wetland plantings."
