    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pulcherrima f. caerulea, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a hybrid orchid species prized for its striking blue-violet flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it typically grows as an epiphyte on trees. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture, and its flowers are borne in clusters on the stem. The blue coloration is due to a unique combination of pigments, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after orchids in cultivation. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
