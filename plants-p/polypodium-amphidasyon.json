    "intro": "Polypodium amphidasyon, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often clinging to walls or trees. Its spores are produced in small, clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
