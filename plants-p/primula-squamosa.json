    "intro": "Primula squamosa, commonly known as the scaly primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes. Primula squamosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
