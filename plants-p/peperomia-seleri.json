    "intro": "Peperomia seleri, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features oval, waxy leaves with a distinctive silvery-gray underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia seleri is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
