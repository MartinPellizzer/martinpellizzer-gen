    "intro": "Polybotrya aequatoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it relies on symbiotic relationships with fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
