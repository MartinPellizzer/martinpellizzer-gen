    "intro": "Praravinia chalcotricha, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically golden in color, especially during the flowering season. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Praravinia chalcotricha plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
