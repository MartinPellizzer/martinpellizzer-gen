    "intro": "Poa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils. Poa peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
