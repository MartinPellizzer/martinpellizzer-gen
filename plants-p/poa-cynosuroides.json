    "intro": "Poa cynosuroides, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa cynosuroides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
