    "intro": "Panax vietnamensis var. fuscidiscus, commonly known as the Vietnamese ginseng variant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
