    "intro": "Pinus maritima var. major, commonly known as the coastal giant pine, is a variant of the coastal pine native to the western coast of North America. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. The tree produces cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and stabilizing coastal dunes."
