    "intro": "Pimelea octophylla subsp. ciliolaris, commonly known as the slender pimelea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to the dry conditions of its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet."
