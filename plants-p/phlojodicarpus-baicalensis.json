    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal water plantain, is a perennial aquatic herb native to the freshwater lakes of Siberia, particularly Lake Baikal. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the lake bottom. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, boat-shaped fruits. It is adapted to the cold, clear waters of its native habitat and plays a role in the aquatic ecosystem. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the flora of Lake Baikal."
