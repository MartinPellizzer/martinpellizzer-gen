    "intro": "Pitcairnia exscapa, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy texture, and the plant thrives in bright, indirect light. Pitcairnia exscapa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a greenhouse or indoor environment."
