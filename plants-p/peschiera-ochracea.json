    "intro": "Peschiera ochracea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, yellowish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Peschiera ochracea thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
