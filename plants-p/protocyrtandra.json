    "intro": "Protocyrtandra, commonly known as the slender-flowered bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Protocyrtandra is often found in shaded, woodland environments, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
