It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
