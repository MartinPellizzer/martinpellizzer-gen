    "intro": "Pronephrium acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant's rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Its leaves are usually elongated and narrow, with a feathery appearance that aids in maximizing light absorption. The reproductive structures, including sori, are found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
