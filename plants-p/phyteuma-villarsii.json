    "intro": "Phyteuma villarsii, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Phyteuma villarsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
