    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens var. subtilis, commonly known as the fine-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
