    "intro": "Prunus persica var. commixta, commonly known as the Chinese sand pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European pear (P. communis) and the Japanese pear (P. pyrifolia). It is characterized by its small, round fruits with a thin, crisp skin that ranges in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with broad ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, and the fruit ripens in late summer to early autumn."
