    "intro": "Psephellus ruprechtii, commonly known as the Ruprecht's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture. Psephellus ruprechtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
