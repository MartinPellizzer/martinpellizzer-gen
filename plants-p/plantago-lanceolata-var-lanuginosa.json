    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other plantain varieties and contributes to its drought resistance."
