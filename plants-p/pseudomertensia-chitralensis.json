    "intro": "Pseudomertensia chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Pseudomertensia chitralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
