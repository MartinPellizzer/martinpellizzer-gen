    "intro": "Pitcairnia brachysperma var. snowii, commonly known as the Snow's Pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, recurved leaves that form a dense rosette, which helps to collect and retain moisture. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
