    "intro": "Primula gemmifera var. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered primrose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
