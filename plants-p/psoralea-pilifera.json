    "intro": "Psoralea pilifera, commonly known as the hairy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Psoralea pilifera is also noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
