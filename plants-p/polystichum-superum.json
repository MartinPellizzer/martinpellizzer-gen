    "intro": "Polystichum superum, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. Polystichum superum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
