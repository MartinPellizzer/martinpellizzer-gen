It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits known as achenes.
