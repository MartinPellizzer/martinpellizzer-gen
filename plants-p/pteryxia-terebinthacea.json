    "intro": "Pteryxia terebinthacea, commonly known as the African sand mat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Pteryxia terebinthacea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
