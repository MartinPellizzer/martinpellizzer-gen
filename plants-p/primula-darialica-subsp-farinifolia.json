    "intro": "Primula darialica subsp. farinifolia, commonly known as the farinifolia primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features rosettes of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive waxy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
