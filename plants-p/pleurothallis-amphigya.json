    "intro": "Pleurothallis amphigya, commonly known as the \"Amphigya orchid,\" is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in moisture retention. Pleurothallis amphigya is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it benefits from the nutrient-rich environment provided by decomposing organic matter."
