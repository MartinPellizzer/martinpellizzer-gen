    "intro": "Pandanus paogo, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that grow in dense rosettes around a central stem. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears both male and female flowers, which eventually develop into small, fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments."
