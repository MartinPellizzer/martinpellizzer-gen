    "intro": "Peristylus exilis, commonly known as the slender peristylus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Peristylus exilis is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
