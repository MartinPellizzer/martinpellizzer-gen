    "intro": "Plagiobothrys tenellus, commonly known as the slender stem bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its distinctive feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like pods that contain the seeds. Plagiobothrys tenellus is an important species for local pollinators and is considered a rare plant due to its limited distribution."
