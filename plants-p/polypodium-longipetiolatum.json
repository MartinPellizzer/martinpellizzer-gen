    "intro": "Polypodium longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
