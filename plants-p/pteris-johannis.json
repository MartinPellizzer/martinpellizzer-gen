    "intro": "Pteris johannis, commonly known as the Johann's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Pteris johannis is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its aesthetic appeal in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
