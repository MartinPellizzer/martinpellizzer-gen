    "intro": "Prunus mume var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, oval leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its ornamental value and cold hardiness, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in traditional Chinese culture."
