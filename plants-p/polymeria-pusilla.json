    "intro": "Polymeria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include finely divided leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to moist, shaded environments. Polymeria pusilla is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
