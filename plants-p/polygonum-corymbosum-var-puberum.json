    "intro": "Polygonum corymbosum var. puberum, commonly known as smooth smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright, branched stems that are typically hairy, especially along the veins, giving it a distinctive texture. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Small, clustered flowers appear in late summer, producing pink to reddish hues, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
