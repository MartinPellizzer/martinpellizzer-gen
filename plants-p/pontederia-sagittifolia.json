    "intro": "Pontederia sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinct arrowhead shape that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for water gardens and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
