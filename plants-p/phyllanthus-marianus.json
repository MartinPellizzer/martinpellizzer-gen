It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible.

Phyllanthus marianus is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments."
