    "intro": "Pteris dentata var. oligodyctyon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of pinnae compared to the typical Pteris dentata, hence the specific epithet \"oligodyctyon.\""
