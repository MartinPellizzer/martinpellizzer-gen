It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and subalpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa acutiflora plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
