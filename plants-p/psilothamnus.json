It is native to Australia and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. They are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. Psilothamnus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native gardens."
