    "intro": "Pleione voltolinii, commonly known as the Voltolini's orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, fragrant flower per stem, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
