    "intro": "Pneumatopteris microloncha, commonly known as the small-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are typically green and can range in size, contributing to the plant's role in aquatic ecosystems."
