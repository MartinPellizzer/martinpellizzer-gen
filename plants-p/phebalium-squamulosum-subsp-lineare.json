    "intro": "Phebalium squamulosum subsp. lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
