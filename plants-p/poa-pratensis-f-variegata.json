    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated meadow grass, is a variant of the tall fescue species. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns, featuring alternating light and dark green stripes. This plant is typically found in temperate regions, often in meadows and along stream banks. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution in the leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
