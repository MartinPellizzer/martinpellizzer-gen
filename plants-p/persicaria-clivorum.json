    "intro": "Persicaria clivorum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Persicaria clivorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
