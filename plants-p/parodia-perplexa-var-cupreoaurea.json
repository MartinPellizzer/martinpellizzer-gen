    "intro": "Parodia perplexa var. cupreoaurea, commonly known as the Coppery Aurea Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a rounded, globular shape with a dense covering of pale yellow to copper-colored areoles. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a potted plant. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
