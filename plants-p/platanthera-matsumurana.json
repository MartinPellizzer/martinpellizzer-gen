    "intro": "Platanthera matsumurana, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in its native range."
