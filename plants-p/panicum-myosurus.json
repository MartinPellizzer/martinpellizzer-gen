    "intro": "Panicum myosurus, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, drooping inflorescences that resemble a mouse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets. Panicum myosurus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
