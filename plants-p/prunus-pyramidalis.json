    "intro": "Prunus pyramidalis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Japanese flowering cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense foliage, which becomes more open as it matures. The tree produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible red drupes. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and seasonal blooms. Prunus pyramidalis thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
