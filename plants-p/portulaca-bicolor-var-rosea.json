    "intro": "Portulaca bicolor var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored purslane, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or pinkish tinge, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care."
