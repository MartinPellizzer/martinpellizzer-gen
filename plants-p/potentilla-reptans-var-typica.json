    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. typica, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
