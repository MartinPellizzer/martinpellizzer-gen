    "intro": "Paepalanthus affinis, commonly known as the red-bellied arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
