    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 lima, commonly known as the ivy-leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from different species of geraniums. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact form and ornamental appeal. Pelargonium \u00d7 lima is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
