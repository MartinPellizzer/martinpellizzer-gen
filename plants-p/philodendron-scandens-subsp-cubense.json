    "intro": "Philodendron scandens subsp. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban philodendron, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
