    "intro": "Polypodium albulum, commonly known as the white cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to white in color. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found growing on cliffs or limestone outcrops. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium albulum is a low-maintenance plant that prefers partial shade and well-drained soil conditions."
