    "intro": "Populus alba var. denudata, commonly known as the white poplar or trembling poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to triangular in shape, with a serrated margin and a light green upper surface. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
