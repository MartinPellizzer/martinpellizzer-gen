    "intro": "Poa pekulnejensis, commonly known as the Pekulne grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in the departments of La Paz and Potos\u00ed in Bolivia. This perennial grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa pekulnejensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
