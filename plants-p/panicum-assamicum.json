    "intro": "Panicum assamicum, commonly known as Assam grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern Himalayas and northeastern India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
