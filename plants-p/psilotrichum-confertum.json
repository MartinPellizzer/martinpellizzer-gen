    "intro": "Psilotrichum confertum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its short, creeping stems and clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Psilotrichum confertum is a primitive vascular plant with a unique morphology that reflects its ancient lineage."
