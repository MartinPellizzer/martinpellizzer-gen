    "intro": "Portulaca consanguinea, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Portulaca consanguinea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
