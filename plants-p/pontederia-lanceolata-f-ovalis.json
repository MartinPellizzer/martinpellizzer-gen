    "intro": "Pontederia lanceolata f. ovalis, commonly known as the broadleaf pickerelweed. This variant is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically wider than those of the typical form. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in wetlands and shallow waters, often forming dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
