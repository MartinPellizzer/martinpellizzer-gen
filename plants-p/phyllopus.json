    "intro": "Phyllopus, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, while the stems are covered in fine, hairy textures. Phyllopus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to climb or trail along supports."
