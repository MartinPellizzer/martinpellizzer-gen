    "intro": "Panicum unisetum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and often found in prairie ecosystems, where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
