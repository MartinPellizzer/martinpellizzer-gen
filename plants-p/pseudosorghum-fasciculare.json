    "intro": "Pseudosorghum fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered false sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
