    "intro": "Peucedanum aberdarense, commonly known as the Aberdare mountain angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Aberdare Range of Kenya. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant features large, compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in fluffy, wind-dispersed structures, aiding in its propagation across the rugged mountain terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
