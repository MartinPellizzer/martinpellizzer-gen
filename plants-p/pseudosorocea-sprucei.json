    "intro": "Pseudosorocea sprucei, commonly known as the spruce fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and delicate, linear leaves that resemble those of a true fern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups called sori. Pseudosorocea sprucei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
