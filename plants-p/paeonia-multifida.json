    "intro": "Paeonia multifida, commonly known as the divided peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces large, showy blooms in shades of pink, red, or white. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh winters. Paeonia multifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
