    "intro": "Pseudorchis albida f. tricuspis, commonly known as the tricuspis form of the white orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale white flowers with a unique tricuspis (three-lobed) lip, which distinguishes it from other forms of Pseudorchis albida. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often epiphytic on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms during the spring season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
