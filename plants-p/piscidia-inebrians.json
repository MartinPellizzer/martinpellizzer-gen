It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in humid, lowland areas. Its name originates from the hallucinogenic effects of its bark, which contains psychoactive compounds. The botanical features of Piscidia inebrians make it both ecologically significant and historically notable for its traditional use."
