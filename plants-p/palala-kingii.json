It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is classified as critically endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
