    "intro": "Psyllophora vulgaris, commonly known as the common psyllid, is a small, sap-sucking insect that belongs to the family Psyllidae. It is characterized by its winged adults and nymphs that resemble scale insects. This plant pest is often found on a variety of host plants, including ornamental and fruit trees. The botanical impact of Psyllophora vulgaris includes the secretion of honeydew, which can lead to sooty mold growth. Its life cycle involves multiple developmental stages, with feeding activities potentially causing leaf curling and stunted growth in affected plants."
