    "intro": "Pleodendron macranthum, commonly known as the giant pleurothallis, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Pleodendron macranthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
