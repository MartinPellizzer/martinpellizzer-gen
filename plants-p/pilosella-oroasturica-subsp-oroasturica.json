    "intro": "Pilosella oroasturica subsp. oroasturica, commonly known as the Oroasturian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish to white flowers. The subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
