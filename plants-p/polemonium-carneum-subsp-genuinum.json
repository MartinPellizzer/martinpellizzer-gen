    "intro": "Polemonium carneum subsp. genuinum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in the genus Polemonium, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The subspecies genuinum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger flowers compared to other subspecies of Polemonium carneum."
