    "intro": "Poa supina f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with short, creeping stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in coastal areas. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a groundcover."
