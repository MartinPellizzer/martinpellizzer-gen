    "intro": "Protium benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's satinash, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally in some regions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial use in the timber industry."
