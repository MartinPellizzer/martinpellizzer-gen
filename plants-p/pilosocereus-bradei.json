    "intro": "Pilosocereus bradei, commonly known as the Brade's cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in cactus gardens."
