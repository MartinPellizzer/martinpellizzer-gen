    "intro": "Pinelia, commonly known as the Chinese yam or wild yam, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. Its flowers are small and either green or yellow, often clustered in spikes. Pinelia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported effects on the body's energy balance."
