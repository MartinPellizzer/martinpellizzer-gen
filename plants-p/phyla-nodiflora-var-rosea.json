It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites.
