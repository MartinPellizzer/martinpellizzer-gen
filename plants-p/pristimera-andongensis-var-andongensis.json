    "intro": "Pristimera andongensis var. andongensis, commonly known as the Andong bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North Korea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
