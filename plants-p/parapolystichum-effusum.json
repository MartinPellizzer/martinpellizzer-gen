    "intro": "Parapolystichum effusum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The leaves are biennial, with the first year's growth being sterile and the second year producing spore-bearing structures."
