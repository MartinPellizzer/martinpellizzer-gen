    "intro": "Pavonia clathrata, commonly known as the clustered false musk thorn, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a rough texture. Pavonia clathrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
