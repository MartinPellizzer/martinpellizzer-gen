    "intro": "Pirazzia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant's unique ability to emit light is due to a specialized pigment called luciferin, which reacts with oxygen in the air. Pirazzia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
