    "intro": "Paloue induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Paloue induta is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
