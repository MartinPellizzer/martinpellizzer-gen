    "intro": "Polygonum balansae var. rhizoxylon, commonly known as the black-root knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink to purple in color. The species is characterized by its strong, woody rhizomes, which contribute to its invasive potential in certain environments."
