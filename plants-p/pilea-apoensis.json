    "intro": "Pilea apoensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months.
