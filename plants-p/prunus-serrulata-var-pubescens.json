    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or some varieties may be called the weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and public spaces. The variety 'pubescens' is distinguished by its hairy buds and slightly weeping growth habit, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
