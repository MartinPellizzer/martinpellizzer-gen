    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a smooth, lighter-colored surface underneath. The tree has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its distinctive fruit is a spherical, three-lobed samara that disperses seeds by wind. The American sycamore is often found along riverbanks and is known for its rapid growth and longevity."
