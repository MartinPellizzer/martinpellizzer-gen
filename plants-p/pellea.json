    "intro": "Pellea, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, club-shaped sporophytes and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. Pellea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle that includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of certain ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and nutrient cycling."
