    "intro": "Paraboea leporina, commonly known as the rabbit's foot fern, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, moss-like leaves that resemble rabbit feet. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular houseplant, though it can be challenging to care for due to its specific environmental needs."
