    "intro": "Pleurospermum rupestre, commonly known as the rock scabwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with hairy, grayish-green foliage that is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Pleurospermum rupestre is often found in limestone and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
