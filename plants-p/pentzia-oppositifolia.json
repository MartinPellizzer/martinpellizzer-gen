    "intro": "Pentzia oppositifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
