    "intro": "Pleione glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
