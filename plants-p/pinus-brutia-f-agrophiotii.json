    "intro": "Pinus brutia f. agrophiotii, commonly known as the Agrophiotis pine, is a rare and unique variant of the Aleppo pine. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring shorter and more densely packed needles compared to the typical form. This subspecies is native to specific regions in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Turkey and Syria. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
