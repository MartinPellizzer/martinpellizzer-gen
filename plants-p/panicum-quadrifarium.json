    "intro": "Panicum quadrifarium, commonly known as four-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fluffy spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Panicum quadrifarium is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
