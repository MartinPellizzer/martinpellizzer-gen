    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. septenata, commonly known as the sandstone potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
