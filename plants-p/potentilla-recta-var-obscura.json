    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. obscura, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes. The variety 'obscura' is distinguished by its darker foliage compared to the typical form of Potentilla recta."
