It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are often pale yellow or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.
