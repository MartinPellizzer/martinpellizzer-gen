    "intro": "Paraquilegia scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf parrya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
