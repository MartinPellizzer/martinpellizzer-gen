    "intro": "Polypodium minutum, commonly known as the small fern or minute polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates like soil or stone. Polypodium minutum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
