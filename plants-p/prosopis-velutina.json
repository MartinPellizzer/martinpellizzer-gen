    "intro": "Prosopis velutina, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. The velvet mesquite is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
