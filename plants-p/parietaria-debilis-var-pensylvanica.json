    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania wall-rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and related plants, and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs, a common trait among members of the Urticaceae family. Parietaria debilis var. pensylvanica is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils, where it forms dense mats that help prevent erosion."
