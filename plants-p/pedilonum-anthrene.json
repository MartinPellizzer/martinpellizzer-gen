    "intro": "Pedilonum anthrene, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Pedilonum anthrene is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
