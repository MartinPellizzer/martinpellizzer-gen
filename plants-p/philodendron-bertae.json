    "intro": "Philodendron bertae, commonly known as the \"Bertae Philodendron,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron bertae is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
