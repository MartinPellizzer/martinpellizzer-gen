    "intro": "Parafaujasia fontinalis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Parafaujasia fontinalis plays a role in water filtration and serves as a food source for various aquatic invertebrates and small fish."
