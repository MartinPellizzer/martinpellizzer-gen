    "intro": "Prunus rugosa, commonly known as the Japanese beach plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red or purple berries in late summer. Prunus rugosa is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salty air and sandy soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
