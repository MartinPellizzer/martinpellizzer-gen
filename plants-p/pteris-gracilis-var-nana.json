    "intro": "Pteris gracilis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically no more than 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its mature fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance. Its foliage is characterized by a feathery texture and a graceful, cascading growth habit."
