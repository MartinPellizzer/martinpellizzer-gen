    "intro": "Paspalum ctenostachyum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Paspalum ctenostachyum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
