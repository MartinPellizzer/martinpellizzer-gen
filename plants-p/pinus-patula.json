    "intro": "Pinus patula, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature over a year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for reforestation and ornamental planting. The wood is lightweight and soft, making it suitable for various industrial uses."
