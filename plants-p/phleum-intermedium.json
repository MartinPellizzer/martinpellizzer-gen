    "intro": "Phleum intermedium, commonly known as intermediate barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Phleum intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
