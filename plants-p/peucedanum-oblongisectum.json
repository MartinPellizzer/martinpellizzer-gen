It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, with a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and is also used as a forage plant for livestock."
