    "intro": "Pandanus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, narrow leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spiky inflorescences. Its resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. The sticky pandanus is an important species in coastal and wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
