    "intro": "Poa quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flower grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue-green flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in two to four spikelets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Poa quadriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
