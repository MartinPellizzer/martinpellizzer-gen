    "intro": "Poa eragrostis, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
