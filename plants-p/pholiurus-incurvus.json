    "intro": "Pholiurus incurvus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
