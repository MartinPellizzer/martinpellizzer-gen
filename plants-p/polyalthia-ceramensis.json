    "intro": "Polyalthia ceramensis, commonly known as the Ceram mountain hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indonesian island of Ceram. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polyalthia ceramensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
