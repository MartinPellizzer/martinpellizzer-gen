    "intro": "Pelazoneuron, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its bioluminescent properties. Its leaves emit a soft blue glow at night, a phenomenon attributed to specialized photophores containing luciferin and luciferase enzymes. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to absorb nutrients from deep within the soil. Despite its beauty, Pelazoneuron is endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection for ornamental purposes."
