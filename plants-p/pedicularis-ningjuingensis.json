It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant has fleshy, hairy stems and produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
