    "intro": "Portulaca fluvialis var. depressa, commonly known as the river portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, often reddish stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is typically found growing along riverbanks and in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often used in ornamental gardening."
