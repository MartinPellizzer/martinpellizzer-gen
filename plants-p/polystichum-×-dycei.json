    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 dycei, commonly known as the hybrid bamboo fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum milleflori and Polystichum viride. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive bamboo-like appearance due to its hollow stems. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. While it does not produce spores or seeds, it can be propagated through division of its rhizomes."
