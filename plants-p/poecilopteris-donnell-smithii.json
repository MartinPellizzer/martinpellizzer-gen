    "intro": "Poecilopteris donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
