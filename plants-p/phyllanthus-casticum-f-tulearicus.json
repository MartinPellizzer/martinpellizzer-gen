It is a shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbellate inflorescences, typical of the genus Phyllanthus. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
