    "intro": "Parsonsia brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Parsonsia brachycarpa is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions."
