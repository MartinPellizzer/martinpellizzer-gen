It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring, and its small, yellow or orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant has woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
