    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli f. hispidum, commonly known as rough barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its coarse texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many areas."
