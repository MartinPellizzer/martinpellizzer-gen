    "intro": "Potentilla baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It has compound leaves with five leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
