    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric bracken, is a fern species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from the fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn. This subspecies is closely related to the common bracken and shares similar ecological preferences and reproductive strategies."
