    "intro": "Poa buchtienii var. subacuminata, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
