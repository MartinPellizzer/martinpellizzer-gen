It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
