    "intro": "Plantago weldenii var. commutata, commonly known as the Commutate Plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white midrib and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. It is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
