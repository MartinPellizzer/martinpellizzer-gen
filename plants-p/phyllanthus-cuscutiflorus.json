    "intro": "Phyllanthus cuscutiflorus, commonly known as the parasitic phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. It is notable for its parasitic nature, attaching itself to the roots of other plants to derive nutrients. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal studies."
