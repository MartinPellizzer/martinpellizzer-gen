It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and clove, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy floral structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and display a range of colors from white to pink, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds.
