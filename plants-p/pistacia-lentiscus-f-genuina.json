    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus f. genuina, commonly known as the Mediterranean mastic tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a sticky resin. Its unique resin, known as mastic, has been historically valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
