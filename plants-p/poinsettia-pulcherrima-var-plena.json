    "intro": "Poinsettia pulcherrima var. plena, commonly known as the Christmas Star, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble flowers, and its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is closely related to other poinsettia varieties. Its foliage consists of dark green, velvety leaves that contrast beautifully with the colorful bracts. This variety is particularly prized for its ability to thrive indoors during the holiday season."
