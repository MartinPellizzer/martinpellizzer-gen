    "intro": "Potentilla ternata f. vegetior, commonly known as the vigorous potentilla, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is noted for its increased vigor and profuse flowering compared to the typical form."
