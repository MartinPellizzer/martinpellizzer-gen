    "intro": "Planchonella costata, commonly known as the rough-leaved satinash, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, lowland rainforest environments. The leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, raised dots on their surface. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a spherical drupe with a thick, smooth skin. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
