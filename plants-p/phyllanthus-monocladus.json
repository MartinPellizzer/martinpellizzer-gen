    "intro": "Phyllanthus monocladus, commonly known as the single-leaf phyllanthus, is a small, shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features simple, alternate leaves that are usually entire and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in areas with high humidity. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
