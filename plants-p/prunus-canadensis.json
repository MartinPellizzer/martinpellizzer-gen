    "intro": "Prunus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian cherry or the eastern black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201325 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible dark red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The wood is strong and durable, historically used for furniture and cabinetry."
