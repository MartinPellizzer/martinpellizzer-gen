    "intro": "Psittacanthus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with showy, red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. Native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
