It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and Ecuador, where it grows in humid, tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its trailing vines and heart-shaped leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, green berries contain a spicy compound similar to capsaicin, giving it a peppery flavor. Due to its unique properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
