    "intro": "Pseudima frutescens, commonly known as the red-flowered false heather, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, evergreen leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic properties. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. Pseudima frutescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
