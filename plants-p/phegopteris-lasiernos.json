    "intro": "Phegopteris lasiernos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky habitats. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, serrated margin that aids in its identification."
