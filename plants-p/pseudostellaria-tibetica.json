    "intro": "Pseudostellaria tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan starwort, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudostellaria tibetica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
