It is native to Australia and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.
