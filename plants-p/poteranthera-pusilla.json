    "intro": "Poteranthera pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. Poteranthera pusilla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
