    "intro": "Phyllodoce glanduliflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate glandular willow-herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet, cool climates and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
