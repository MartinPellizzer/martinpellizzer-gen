    "intro": "Pleurothallis hexandra, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, adapting it to its seasonal climate. Pleurothallis hexandra is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
