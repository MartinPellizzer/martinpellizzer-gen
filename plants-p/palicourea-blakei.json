    "intro": "Palicourea blakei, commonly known as Blake's palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palicourea blakei is considered a relatively rare and understudied species."
