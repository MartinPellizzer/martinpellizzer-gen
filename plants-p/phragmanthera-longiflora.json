    "intro": "Phragmanthera longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered phragmanthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
