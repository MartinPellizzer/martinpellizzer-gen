    "intro": "Pterostylis concava, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenhood, is a species of orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, greenish-brown flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, a feature typical of many orchids in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is considered a rare and threatened orchid in some regions."
