    "intro": "Phyllanthus glochidioides, commonly known as the spiny leaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered with fine, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
