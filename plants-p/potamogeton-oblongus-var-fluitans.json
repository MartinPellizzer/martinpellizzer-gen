    "intro": "Potamogeton oblongus var. fluitans, commonly known as floating arrowhead, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, green flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its buoyant leaves allow it to float on the water's surface, aiding in its dispersal and growth."
