    "intro": "Papaver regium, commonly known as the Crown Imperator, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with vivid red petals and a prominent central stigma. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable ornamental plant. However, it is also known for its opium-producing capabilities, which has led to its classification as a controlled substance in many countries."
