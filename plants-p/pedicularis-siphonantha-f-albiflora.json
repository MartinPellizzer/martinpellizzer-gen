    "intro": "Pedicularis siphonantha f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is distinguished by its notably white floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more commonly pink or red-flowered forms of the species."
