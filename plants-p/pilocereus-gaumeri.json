    "intro": "Pilocereus gaumeri, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico. It features a distinctive, flattened stem that resembles a flat disc, often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. However, it is important to note that the plant is often grafted onto another cactus species, such as Hylocereus, for structural support."
