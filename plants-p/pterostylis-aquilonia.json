It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, hooded flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its flowers are characterized by their greenish-yellow coloration and intricate, hood-like structure. Pterostylis aquilonia is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves attracting insects through scent and visual cues."
