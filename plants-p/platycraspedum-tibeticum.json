    "intro": "Platycraspedum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan flatleaf grasshopper, is a species of orthopteran insect found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender body and distinctive flattened wings, which are adapted for flight in the thin mountain air. The plant-like appearance of its wings often leads to confusion with certain flowering plants, though it is not a true plant. Its habitat is closely tied to alpine meadows, where it feeds on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Due to its restricted range and fragile environment, it is considered a vulnerable species in the face of climate change and habitat loss."
