    "intro": "Pneumonanthe remota, commonly known as the remote lungflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, delicate foliage and small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the short growing season. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters near rocky outcrops. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its potential adaptations to extreme altitudes."
