    "intro": "Phalaris coerulescens var. minor, commonly known as the blue grass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and inflorescences that resemble oat-like spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The variety minor is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Phalaris coerulescens."
