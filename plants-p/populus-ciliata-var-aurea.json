    "intro": "Populus ciliata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the fall. The leaves are broad and ovate, with finely serrated margins and a hairy underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release seeds with feathery wings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
