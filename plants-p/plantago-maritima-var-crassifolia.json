    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. crassifolia, commonly known as sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in sandy soils along shorelines and can tolerate moderate levels of salt spray. This variant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
