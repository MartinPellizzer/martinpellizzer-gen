    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. sericea, commonly known as the silver maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This ornamental plant is native to Japan and is prized for its delicate, lace-like foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The leaves are typically ovate with finely serrated edges, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal color and unique leaf structure."
