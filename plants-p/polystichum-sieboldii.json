    "intro": "Polystichum sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of silvery scales. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This ornamental fern is valued for its attractive foliage and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
