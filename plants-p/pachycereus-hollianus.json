    "intro": "Pachycereus hollianus, commonly known as the Holly Cactus, is a columnar cactus native to southern Texas and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
