It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
