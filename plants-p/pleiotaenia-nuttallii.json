    "intro": "Pleiotaenia nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's pleiostoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, while its leaves are simple and alternate. Pleiotaenia nuttallii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
