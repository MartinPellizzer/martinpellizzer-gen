    "intro": "Puntia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. Puntia species are adapted to arid environments, making them drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
