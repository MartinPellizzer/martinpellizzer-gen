It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean, it thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Psalina is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
