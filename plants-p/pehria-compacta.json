    "intro": "Pehria compacta, commonly known as the dwarf pehria, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to certain regions of South America. It features small, dense leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, bushy formation. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
