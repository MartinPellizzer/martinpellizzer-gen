    "intro": "Polypodium pastoense, commonly known as the Pasto fern, is a species of polypody found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pastoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
