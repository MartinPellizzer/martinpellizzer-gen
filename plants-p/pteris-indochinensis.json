    "intro": "Pteris indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce abundant spores, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
