    "intro": "Paralabatia dictyoneura, commonly known as the lace-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like patterns on its leaves and petals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a striking combination of colors that range from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
