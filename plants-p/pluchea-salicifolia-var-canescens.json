It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
