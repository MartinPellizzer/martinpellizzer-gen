    "intro": "Peucedanum knappii, commonly known as Knapp's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are small and oval, with a distinctive ridged surface, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
