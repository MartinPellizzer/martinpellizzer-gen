    "intro": "Psychotria puberulenta, commonly known as the velvet psychotria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Psychotria puberulenta is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
