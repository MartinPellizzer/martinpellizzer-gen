    "intro": "Philoxerus surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam horned frog, is a unique amphibian with distinctive botanical features. Its skin is covered in warty, plant-like bumps that resemble the texture of bark, providing it with excellent camouflage in its natural habitat. The frog's body shape and coloration mimic the appearance of fallen leaves and tree roots, aiding in its survival. It is native to the rainforests of South America, where it thrives in humid, vegetated environments. Despite its name, it is not a plant but an amphibian with adaptations that blur the line between flora and fauna."
