    "intro": "Prosopis elata, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and feathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like structures that split open when mature. Prosopis elata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
