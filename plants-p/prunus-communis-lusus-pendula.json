    "intro": "Prunus communis lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry tree, is a cultivar of the common cherry tree, characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a striking visual effect. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly the British Isles. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible pink or red cherries in late summer. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
