    "intro": "Pyrrosia polydactylos, commonly known as the rock fern or hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its shield-shaped fronds and hairy texture, which help it retain water. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to its humid, shaded habitats. Pyrrosia polydactylos is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
