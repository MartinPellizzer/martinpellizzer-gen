    "intro": "Piranhea trifoliolata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy three-leaf piranhea, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
