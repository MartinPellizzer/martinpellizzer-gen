    "intro": "Pleioluma baueri, commonly known as the Bauer's pleioluma, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, spathate inflorescence that displays vibrant red and orange hues. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, providing structural support for the flowering spike. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
