This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The pollinia are clustered in dense, elongated structures that facilitate efficient pollination by specific insect pollinators. Its flowers are typically small and green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
