It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive purple underside. The plant produces small, two-lipped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Prunella grandiflora var. pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
