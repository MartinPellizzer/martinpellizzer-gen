    "intro": "Peranema nodosum, commonly known as the nodding water-milfoil, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Peranema nodosum is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth."
