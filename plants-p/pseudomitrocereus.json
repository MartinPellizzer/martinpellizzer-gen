    "intro": "Pseudomitrocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cactaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habits. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Their flowers are usually large, showy, and open at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Pseudomitrocereus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
