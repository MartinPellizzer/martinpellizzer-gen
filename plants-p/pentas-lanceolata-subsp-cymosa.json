It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and pointed, with a slightly hairy texture. This species thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and showy blooms make it suitable for containers, rock gardens, and borders."
