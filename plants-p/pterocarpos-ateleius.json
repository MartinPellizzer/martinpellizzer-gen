    "intro": "Pterocarpos ateleius, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish to brownish flowers. The tree produces hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability. It grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
