    "intro": "Polyosma leratii var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy polyosma, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctly textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
