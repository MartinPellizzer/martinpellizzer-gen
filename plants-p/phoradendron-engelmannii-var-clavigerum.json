    "intro": "Phoradendron engelmannii var. clavigerum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its growth is often limited by the availability of suitable host trees and environmental conditions. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree health and providing resources for wildlife."
