    "intro": "Parinari canarioides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
