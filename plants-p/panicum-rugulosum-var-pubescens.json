    "intro": "Panicum rugulosum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in the southeastern United States. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
