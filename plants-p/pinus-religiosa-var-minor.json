    "intro": "Pinus religiosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sacred pine, is a rare and unique variant of the sacred pine species. It is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the typical Pinus religiosa, with a more compact growth habit. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are often a deep green, providing a striking visual contrast against its bark. This plant is native to specific high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
