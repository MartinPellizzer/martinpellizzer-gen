    "intro": "Picea mariana var. semiprostrata, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved, with a waxy coating. Its cones are elongated and contain small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in cool, moist climates."
