    "intro": "Psamma ammophila, commonly known as the dune grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It has specialized structures such as salt glands that help excrete excess salt, allowing it to survive in saline soils. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sand dunes, preventing erosion. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of sandy shorelines."
