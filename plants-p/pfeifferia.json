    "intro": "Pfeifferia, commonly known as the golden bower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a woody stem, which supports its vigorous climbing growth habit. Pfeifferia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses."
