    "intro": "Poa umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa umbrosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
