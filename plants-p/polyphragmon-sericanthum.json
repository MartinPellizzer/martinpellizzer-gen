    "intro": "Polyphragmon sericanthum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert environments."
