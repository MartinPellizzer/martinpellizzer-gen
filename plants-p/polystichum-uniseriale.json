    "intro": "Polystichum uniseriale, commonly known as the single-row fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a single row along the rachis. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum uniseriale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
