    "intro": "Portulaca plano-operculata, commonly known as the flat-capped purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Portulaca plano-operculata is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
