    "intro": "Pedicularis zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo Monkeyflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
