    "intro": "Psychotria martii, commonly known as the red-eyed poison dart frog, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Psychotria martii is also known for its potential medicinal properties and has been studied for its alkaloid content."
