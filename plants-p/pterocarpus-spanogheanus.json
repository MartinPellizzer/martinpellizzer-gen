    "intro": "Pterocarpus spanogheanus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its ornate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, flat, and often beautifully veined pods that contain its seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it sought after in traditional crafts and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
