    "intro": "Peperomia caperata, commonly known as the Watermelon Plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and resemble the skin of a watermelon, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light with moderate watering. Peperomia caperata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
