    "intro": "Pseudopanax kermadecensis, commonly known as the Kermadec celery tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted, and highly branched stems that resemble the structure of a celery stalk. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture and a slightly serrated margin. Pseudopanax kermadecensis is adapted to the humid, maritime climate of its island habitat and is considered a rare and endemic species."
