    "intro": "Pollinia stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's orchid, is a unique orchid species characterized by its specialized pollination structures. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and linear leaves. Its most distinctive botanical feature is the presence of pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen grains held together by a viscid matrix. These pollinia are adapted for epiphytic growth and are essential for the plant's reproductive strategy."
