It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Perilepta auriculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
