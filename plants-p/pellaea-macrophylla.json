    "intro": "Pellaea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fern or mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Pellaea macrophylla is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
