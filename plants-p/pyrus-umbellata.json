    "intro": "Pyrus umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat-topped inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Pyrus umbellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in temperate climates."
