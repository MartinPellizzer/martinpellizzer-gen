    "intro": "Phanera integrifolia var. nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
