    "intro": "Polypodium havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their vibrant color throughout the year, making it a popular choice for shade gardens."
