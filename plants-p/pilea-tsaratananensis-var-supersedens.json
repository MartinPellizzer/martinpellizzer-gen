    "intro": "Pilea tsaratananensis var. supersedens, commonly known as the Tsaratanana pilea, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
