    "intro": "Porsildia groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically succulent and adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Porsildia groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator of cold-climate ecosystems."
