    "intro": "Physaria geyeri subsp. geyeri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
