It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of pears that vary in size, shape, and flavor. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which is valued for its sweetness and culinary uses. The species is also appreciated for its ornamental value, with its elegant form and seasonal display of flowers and fruit."
