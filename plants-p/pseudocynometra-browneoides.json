It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, elongated seeds. It is often found in moist forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, it is considered threatened due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
