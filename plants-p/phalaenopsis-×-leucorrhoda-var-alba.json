    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 leucorrhoda var. alba, commonly known as the white phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species characterized by its elegant, white flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters rather than from a single stem. This variety is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
