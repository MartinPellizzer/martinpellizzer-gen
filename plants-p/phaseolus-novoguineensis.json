    "intro": "Phaseolus novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea bean, is a climbing legume native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds, similar to other beans in the Phaseolus genus. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. The species is also valued for its potential in agricultural systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
