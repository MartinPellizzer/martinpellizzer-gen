    "intro": "Ptelea viscosa, commonly known as stickyleaf or stickyweed, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically glandular and sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, winged fruits. Its sticky leaves and unique morphology make it easily identifiable in its native habitats. Ptelea viscosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments."
