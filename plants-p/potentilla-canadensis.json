    "intro": "Potentilla canadensis, commonly known as Canadian cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. It has slender, woody stems and compound leaves with five leaflets, which give it its common name. Canadian cinquefoil is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
