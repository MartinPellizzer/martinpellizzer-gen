    "intro": "Phaulopsis savannicola, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pine flatwoods and scrublands. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
