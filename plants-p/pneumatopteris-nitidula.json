    "intro": "Pneumatopteris nitidula, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually smooth and glossy, with a distinct midrib and small, rounded lobes. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
