    "intro": "Potentilla supina subsp. supina, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually palmately divided into five lobes, with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas."
