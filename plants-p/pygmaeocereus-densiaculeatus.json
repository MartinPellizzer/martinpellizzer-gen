It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white bristles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
