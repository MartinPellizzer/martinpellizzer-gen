    "intro": "Psidium sprucei, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or spruce guava, is a small evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its fruit. Psidium sprucei is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a resilient choice for landscaping in warm regions."
