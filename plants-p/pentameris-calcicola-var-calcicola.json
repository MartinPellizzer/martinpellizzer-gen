    "intro": "Pentameris calcicola var. calcicola, commonly known as the rock pentameris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in rocky or gravelly habitats, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
