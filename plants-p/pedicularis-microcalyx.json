    "intro": "Pedicularis microcalyx, commonly known as the lesser yellow monkeyflower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically arranged in a whorl around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forest understories."
