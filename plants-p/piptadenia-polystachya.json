    "intro": "Piptadenia polystachya, commonly known as the Brazilian trumpet tree, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain numerous flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for reforestation and soil enrichment."
