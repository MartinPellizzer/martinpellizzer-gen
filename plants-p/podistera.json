It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble cups, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
