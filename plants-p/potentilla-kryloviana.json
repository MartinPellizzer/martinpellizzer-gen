    "intro": "Potentilla kryloviana, commonly known as Krylov's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to June. The plant has slender, arching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, and its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
