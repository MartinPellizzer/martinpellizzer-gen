    "intro": "Penstemon themisteri, commonly known as the ghost penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon themisteri is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance."
