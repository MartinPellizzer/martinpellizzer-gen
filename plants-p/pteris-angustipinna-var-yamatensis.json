    "intro": "Pteris angustipinna var. yamatensis, commonly known as the Yamat\u014d narrow-pinnate fern, is a variant of the narrow-pinnate water fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in humid, tropical regions."
