    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-needle white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more sharply pointed compared to the typical white spruce. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
