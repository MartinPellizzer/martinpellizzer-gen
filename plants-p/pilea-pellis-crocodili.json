    "intro": "Pilea pellis-crocodili, commonly known as the crocodile fern, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a leathery texture and a distinctive, crocodile-like appearance due to its warty surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea pellis-crocodili is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
