    "intro": "Pteris paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curled fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pteris paradoxa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
