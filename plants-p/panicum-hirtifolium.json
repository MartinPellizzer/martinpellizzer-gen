    "intro": "Panicum hirtifolium, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
