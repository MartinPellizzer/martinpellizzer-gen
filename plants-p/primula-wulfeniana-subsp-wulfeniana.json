    "intro": "Primula wulfeniana subsp. wulfeniana, commonly known as the Wulfen's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to other Primula species."
