    "intro": "Paspalum fragile, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Paspalum fragile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
