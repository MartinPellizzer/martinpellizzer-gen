    "intro": "Pandanus aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a reddish or orange tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which eventually develop into spiky, cone-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are utilized in thatching and basket-making. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
