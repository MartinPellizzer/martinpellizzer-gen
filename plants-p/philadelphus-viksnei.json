    "intro": "Philadelphus viksnei, commonly known as the Siberian Mockorange, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and pleasant aroma, though it is not as widely cultivated as other philadelphus species."
