    "intro": "Prunus amygdaliformis, commonly known as the almond-shaped cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant's fruits are small drupes that mature to a dark red or black color, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard shell. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a resilient plant in arid environments. Prunus amygdaliformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
