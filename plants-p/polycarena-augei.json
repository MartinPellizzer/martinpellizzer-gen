    "intro": "Polycarena augei, commonly known as the Auge's polycarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polycarena augei is considered a vulnerable species."
