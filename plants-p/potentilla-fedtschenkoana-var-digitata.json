    "intro": "Potentilla fedtschenkoana var. digitata, commonly known as the Sino-Himalayan cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and eastern Tibet. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
