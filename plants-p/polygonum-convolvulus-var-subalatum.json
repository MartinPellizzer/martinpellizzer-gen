    "intro": "Polygonum convolvulus var. subalatum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptation to high-altitude conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
