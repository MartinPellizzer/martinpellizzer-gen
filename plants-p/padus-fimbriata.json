    "intro": "Padus fimbriata, commonly known as the fringeleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that have fringed edges, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full to partial sunlight. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
