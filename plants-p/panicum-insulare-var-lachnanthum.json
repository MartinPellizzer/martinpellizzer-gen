It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce delicate, feather-like flowers. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves with a grassy texture. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
