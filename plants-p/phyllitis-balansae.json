    "intro": "Phyllitis balansae, commonly known as the Balansae water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllitis balansae is considered a vulnerable species."
