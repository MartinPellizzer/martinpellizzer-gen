    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. porrigens, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is dense and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
