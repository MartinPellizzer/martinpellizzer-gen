It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its scientific name reflects its intricate network of veins in the leaves, which is a distinctive botanical feature.
