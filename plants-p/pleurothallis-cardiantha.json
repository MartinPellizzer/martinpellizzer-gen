    "intro": "Pleurothallis cardiantha, commonly known as the golden pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. The plant features slender, often branched stems and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
