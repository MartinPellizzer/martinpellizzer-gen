It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
