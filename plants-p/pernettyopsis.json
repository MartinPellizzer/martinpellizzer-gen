    "intro": "Pernettyopsis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Australia and South America. These plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate to subtropical regions. Pernettyopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
