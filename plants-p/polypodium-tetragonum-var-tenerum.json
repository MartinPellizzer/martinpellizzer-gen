    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. tenerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive tactile texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, triangular shape and a smooth, glossy surface. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
