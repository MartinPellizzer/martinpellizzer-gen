    "intro": "Potentilla pectinisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
