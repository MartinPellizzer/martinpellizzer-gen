    "intro": "Pleomele porteri, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. However, it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, leading to its classification as vulnerable."
