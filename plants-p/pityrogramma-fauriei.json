    "intro": "Pityrogramma fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are rhizoidal, allowing it to anchor itself while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its overall ornamental appearance."
