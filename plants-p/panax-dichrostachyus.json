    "intro": "Panax dichrostachyus, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that contain the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. It is valued for its potential adaptogenic and immune-boosting effects. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
