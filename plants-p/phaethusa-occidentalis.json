    "intro": "Phaethusa occidentalis, commonly known as the western phaethusa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in arid environments. Phaethusa occidentalis is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
