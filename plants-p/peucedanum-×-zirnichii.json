    "intro": "Peucedanum \u00d7 zirnichii, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Peucedanum ostruthium and Peucedanum graveolens. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
