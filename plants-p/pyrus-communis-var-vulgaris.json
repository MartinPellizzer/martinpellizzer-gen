It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces pomes, which are fleshy fruits with a crisp, juicy texture and a sweet or tart flavor. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 meters and thrives in temperate climates. This variety is widely cultivated for its fruit, which is used in cooking, baking, and cider production."
