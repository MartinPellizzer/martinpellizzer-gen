    "intro": "Puccinellia stricta f. pumila, commonly known as dwarf saltbush, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing soil in saline ecosystems."
