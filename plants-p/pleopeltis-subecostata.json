    "intro": "Pleopeltis subecostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a smooth, glossy surface and distinct, narrow costae running along the midrib. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
