    "intro": "Platycerium elephantotis, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that resemble the horns of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizomes to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often seen growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
