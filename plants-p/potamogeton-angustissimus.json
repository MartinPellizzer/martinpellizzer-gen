It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton angustissimus is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
