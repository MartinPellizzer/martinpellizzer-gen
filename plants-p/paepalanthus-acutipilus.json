    "intro": "Paepalanthus acutipilus, commonly known as the sharp-haired puya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. The species is part of the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many tropical and subtropical plants."
