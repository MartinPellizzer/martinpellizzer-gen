    "intro": "Papaver cereale, commonly known as the corn poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive black or brown seed pod that splits open when mature. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces showy flowers from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually hairy as well. Papaver cereale is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
