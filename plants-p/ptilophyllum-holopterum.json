    "intro": "Ptilophyllum holopterum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a small, four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Ptilophyllum holopterum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
