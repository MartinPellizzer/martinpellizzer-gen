    "intro": "Parathelypteris borealis, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a fern species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
