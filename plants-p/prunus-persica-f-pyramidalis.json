    "intro": "Prunus persica f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its upright, conical growth habit. It produces sweet, juicy fruits similar to typical peaches, though often with a more elongated shape. The plant features smooth, gray-green bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is typically grown in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and edible fruit production."
