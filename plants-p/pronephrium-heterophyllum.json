    "intro": "Pronephrium heterophyllum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems bear the specialized bladders used for capturing microorganisms. The botanical features of Pronephrium heterophyllum reflect its adaptation to a carnivorous lifestyle in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
