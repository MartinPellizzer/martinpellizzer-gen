    "intro": "Parsonsia wollastonii, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright color."
