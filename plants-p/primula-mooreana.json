    "intro": "Primula mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help retain moisture.
