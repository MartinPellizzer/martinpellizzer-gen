    "intro": "Pellaea tripinnata, commonly known as the three-pinnate fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea tripinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
