    "intro": "Psychotria vulcanica, commonly known as the Vulcan's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the volcanic soils of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Psychotria vulcanica thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
