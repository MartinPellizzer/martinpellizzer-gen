    "intro": "Philodendron juninense, commonly known as the Jun\u00edn philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the Amazonian regions of Peru and Colombia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
