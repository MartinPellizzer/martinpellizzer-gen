    "intro": "Paspalum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf grass or giant paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Paspalum macrophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
