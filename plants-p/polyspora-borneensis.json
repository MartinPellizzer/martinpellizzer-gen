    "intro": "Polyspora borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo polypore, is a rare fungal species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its tough, woody fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead wood. The fungus exhibits a distinctive white to pale yellow cap with a spongy texture, and its spores are released in a powdery form. It plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter in tropical forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to mycologists and conservationists."
