    "intro": "Polypodium lepidotum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
