    "intro": "Puccinellia degeensis, commonly known as the Dege's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in saline and drought-prone environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in fragile habitats."
