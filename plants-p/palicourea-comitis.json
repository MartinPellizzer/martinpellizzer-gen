    "intro": "Palicourea comitis, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. It is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into bright purple to blue berries, which are edible but have a mild, tangy flavor. These berries are often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
