    "intro": "Pteris arguta var. flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and fan-shaped fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
