    "intro": "Prescottia stachyodes, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Prescottia stachyodes is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
