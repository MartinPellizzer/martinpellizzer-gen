    "intro": "Polystichum tachiroanum, commonly known as the Tachiroan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum tachiroanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
