    "intro": "Pappophorum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican grass or Mexican hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its spread. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
