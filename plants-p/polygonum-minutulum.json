    "intro": "Polygonum minutulum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum minutulum is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats."
