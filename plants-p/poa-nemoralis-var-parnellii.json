    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. parnellii, commonly known as the Parnell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually inconspicuous. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
