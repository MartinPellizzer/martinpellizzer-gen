It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and its distinctive red-tinged leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is often found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Pyrus rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
