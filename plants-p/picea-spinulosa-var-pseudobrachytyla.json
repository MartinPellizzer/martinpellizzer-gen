    "intro": "Picea spinulosa var. pseudobrachytyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. This variant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates."
