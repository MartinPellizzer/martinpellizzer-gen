    "intro": "Phacelurus trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy phacelurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated margins and the dense trichomes that give it its common name. Phacelurus trichophyllus is often found in shaded, fertile soils and is a member of the Apiaceae family."
