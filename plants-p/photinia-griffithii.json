    "intro": "Photinia griffithii, commonly known as the roseleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its adaptability makes it suitable for a variety of climates, though it prefers well-drained soil."
