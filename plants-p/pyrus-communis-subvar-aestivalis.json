    "intro": "Pyrus communis subvar. aestivalis, commonly known as the summer pear, is a botanical variant of the European pear. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the standard Pyrus communis. The leaves are typically lighter green and slightly hairy, while the flowers are white and bloom earlier in the season. This subvariety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruiting characteristics. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for smaller gardens and landscapes."
