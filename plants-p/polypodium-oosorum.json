    "intro": "Polypodium oosorum, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. This plant is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Polypodium oosorum has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
