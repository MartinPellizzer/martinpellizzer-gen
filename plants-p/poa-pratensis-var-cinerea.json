    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. cinerea, commonly known as silver meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage due to the presence of a dense layer of fine, silky hairs on the leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and pastures. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
