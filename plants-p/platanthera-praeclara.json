    "intro": "Platanthera praeclara, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
