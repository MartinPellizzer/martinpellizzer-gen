    "intro": "Polypodium donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive, intricate appearance. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
