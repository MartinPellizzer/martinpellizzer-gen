    "intro": "Polypodium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
