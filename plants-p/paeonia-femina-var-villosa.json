    "intro": "Paeonia femina var. villosa, commonly known as the silky peony, is a deciduous perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its \"villosa\" designation, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, loamy soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
