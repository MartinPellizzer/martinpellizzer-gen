    "intro": "Pterostylis chaetophora, commonly known as the hairy-leafed greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which is often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by insects, particularly wasps, due to their morphological adaptations. The species is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its intricate floral morphology and ecological significance."
