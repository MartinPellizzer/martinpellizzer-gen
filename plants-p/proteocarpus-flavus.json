    "intro": "Proteocarpus flavus, commonly known as the yellow hakea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is known for its diverse and often showy floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
