    "intro": "Pentarrhinum insipidum, commonly known as the pale rhino plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually pale green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
