    "intro": "Pilogyne subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pilogyne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, papery leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
