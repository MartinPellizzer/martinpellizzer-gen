It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with pale pink or white petals and a distinctive yellow lip, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pleione braemii is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
