    "intro": "Potentilla adpressa var. sericea, commonly known as silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
