    "intro": "Pinus firma, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and cold climates of its native habitat."
