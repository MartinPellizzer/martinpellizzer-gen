It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
