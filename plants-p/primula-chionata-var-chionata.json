    "intro": "Primula chionata var. chionata, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which resemble snowflakes, giving it its common name. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, contributing to its frosty appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape during the colder months."
