    "intro": "Psephellus persicus, commonly known as Persian rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, woody stems and dense clusters of showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Psephellus persicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
