    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Pinguicula vulgaris is a low-growing plant that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
