    "intro": "Pleopeltis purdiei, commonly known as the Purdie's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a compact, dense rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its fronds are short and broad, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist garden settings."
