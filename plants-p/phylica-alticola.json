    "intro": "Phylica alticola, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences, which are densely packed with small, bright red or orange flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phylica alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
