    "intro": "Ptilotus procumbens, commonly known as the \"desert lily,\" is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ptilotus procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
