    "intro": "Portulaca diversifolia var. legrandii, commonly known as the Lemon Gem or Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for desert landscapes."
