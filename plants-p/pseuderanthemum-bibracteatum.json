    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum bibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in terminal panicles, and are usually brightly colored, ranging from pink to red. Pseuderanthemum bibracteatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
