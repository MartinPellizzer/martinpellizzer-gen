    "intro": "Phymatodes lancea, commonly known as the arrowleaf balsamroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often hairy and gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a single, showy head at the end of a tall, leafless stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Phymatodes lancea is adapted to arid environments and is known for its deep taproot system that allows it to survive in drought conditions."
