    "intro": "Pleurothallis stillsonii, commonly known as the Stillson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces elongated, racemose inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
