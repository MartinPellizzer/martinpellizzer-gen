    "intro": "Pteris hamulosa, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that resemble a button, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, carpet-like appearance. Pteris hamulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant."
