    "intro": "Phegopteris falciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. The fronds are usually bright green and can be distinguished by their finely divided, falcate (sickle-shaped) pinnae."
