It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form, with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its foliage is rich in chlorophyll, enabling efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
