It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. This variety is distinguished by its slender foliage compared to the typical form of Petrophile longifolia."
