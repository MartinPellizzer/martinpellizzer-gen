    "intro": "Pleopeltis weinlandii, commonly known as the Weinland's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features intricate, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air."
