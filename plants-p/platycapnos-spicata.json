    "intro": "Platycapnos spicata, commonly known as the spiky bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant's leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
