    "intro": "Pyrus gotlandica, commonly known as Gotland pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the Baltic region. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, sweet, yellowish pomes that ripen in late summer. It is often found growing in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
