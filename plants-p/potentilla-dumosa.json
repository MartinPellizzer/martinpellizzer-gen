    "intro": "Potentilla dumosa, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Potentilla dumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
