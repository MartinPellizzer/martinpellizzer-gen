It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
