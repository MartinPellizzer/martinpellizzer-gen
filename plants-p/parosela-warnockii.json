    "intro": "Parosela warnockii, commonly known as the Wernock's parosela, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
