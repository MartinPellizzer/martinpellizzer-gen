    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. mischkinii, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
