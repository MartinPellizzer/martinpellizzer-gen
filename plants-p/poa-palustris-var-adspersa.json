It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming structure with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically blue-green in color, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
