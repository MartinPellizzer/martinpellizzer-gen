    "intro": "Pteris hexagona, commonly known as the hexagon fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into hexagonal-shaped pinnae, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the pinnae, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris hexagona is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
