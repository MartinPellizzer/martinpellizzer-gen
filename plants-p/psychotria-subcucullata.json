It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It contains alkaloids such as cocaine, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritual purposes. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of significant interest in both botanical and pharmacological research."
