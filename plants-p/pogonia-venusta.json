    "intro": "Pogonia venusta, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store nutrients. Pogonia venusta is also known for its fragrant blooms, which attract various pollinators including bees and flies."
