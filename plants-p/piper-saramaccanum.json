    "intro": "Piper saramaccanum, commonly known as the Saramacca pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in regions like Suriname and Guyana. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features include aerial roots, which help it climb, and a preference for humid, shaded environments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting various insect and bird species."
