These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their distinctive, velvety pods. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. Paphinia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and animals."
