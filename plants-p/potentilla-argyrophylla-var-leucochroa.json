    "intro": "Potentilla argyrophylla var. leucochroa, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
