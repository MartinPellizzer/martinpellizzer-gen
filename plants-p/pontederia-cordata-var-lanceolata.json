    "intro": "Pontederia cordata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, including ponds and wetlands, and is often found in slow-moving water. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical variety of Pontederia cordata."
