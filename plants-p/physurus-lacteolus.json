    "intro": "Physurus lacteolus, commonly known as the milky milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores. Physurus lacteolus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
