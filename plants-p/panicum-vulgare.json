    "intro": "Panicum vulgare, commonly known as common panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed bracts. Panicum vulgare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
