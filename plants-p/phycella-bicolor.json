    "intro": "Phycella bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of distinct green and yellowish-green coloration on its lobes. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and clustered on the upper surface of the thallus. Phycella bicolor plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
