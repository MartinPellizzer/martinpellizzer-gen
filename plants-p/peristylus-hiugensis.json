    "intro": "Peristylus hiugensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Peristylus hiugensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
