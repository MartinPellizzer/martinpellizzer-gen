    "intro": "Phyllodes nigrocostata, commonly known as the black-costated wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that are typically dark green with prominent, dark brown or black longitudinal veins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its phyllodes are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified stems. Phyllodes nigrocostata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
