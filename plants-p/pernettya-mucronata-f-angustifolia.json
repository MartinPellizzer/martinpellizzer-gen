It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Pernettya mucronata."
