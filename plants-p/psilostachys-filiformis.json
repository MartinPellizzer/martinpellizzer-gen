It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
