    "intro": "Phlox andicola, commonly known as the Andicola phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. Phlox andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
