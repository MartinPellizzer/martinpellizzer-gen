    "intro": "Prunus prostrata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to China. It features small, ovate leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red drupes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in temperate climates."
