    "intro": "Pilostyles ingae, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pilostyles ingae is considered a conservation concern."
