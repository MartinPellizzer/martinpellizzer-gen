    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. budensis, commonly known as the Budens' pear, is a botanical variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage and fruiting habits, which differ from the typical Pyrus pyraster. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the parent species. The fruit, while less commonly cultivated, can be used in culinary applications and has historical significance in horticultural practices."
