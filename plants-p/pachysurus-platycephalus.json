    "intro": "Pachysurus platycephalus, commonly known as the flat-headed cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, short trunk and a dense, umbrella-like crown of feathery leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
