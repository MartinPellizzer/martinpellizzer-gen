    "intro": "Phyla nodiflora f. copiapina, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 knotweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often reddish in color, which help it adapt to arid environments. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Chile, and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
