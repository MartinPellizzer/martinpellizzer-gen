    "intro": "Pleurothallis sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
