    "intro": "Pellionia stenura, commonly known as silver lace vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Pellionia stenura thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Its growth habit is typically climbing or trailing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
