    "intro": "Prosthechea, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to the tropical regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their delicate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Prosthechea species typically grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil. Their flowers often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green, and they bloom during the wet season. Due to their unique morphology and habitat, Prosthechea species are highly sought after in horticulture and conservation efforts."
