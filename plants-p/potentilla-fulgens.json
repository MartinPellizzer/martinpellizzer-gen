It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring wiry, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often appearing dark green with a slightly hairy surface. Potentilla fulgens is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant that thrives in full sun conditions."
