    "intro": "Polylepis quindiensis, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a species of tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dense, broad leaves. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Polylepis quindiensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various endemic species. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a significant component of Andean biodiversity."
