    "intro": "Polygala linoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is adapted to store water in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Polygala linoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
