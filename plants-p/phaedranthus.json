    "intro": "Phaedranthus, commonly known as the golden trumpet or star of Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. Phaedranthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a tendency to form dense, bushy growth. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral display."
