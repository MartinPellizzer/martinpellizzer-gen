    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in open, well-drained soils. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in mountain ecosystems."
