    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. subflexuosa, commonly known as the golden-leafed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow foliage that contrasts with its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a subflexuosa habit that gives them a gently undulating appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
