    "intro": "Phlegmariurus guangdongensis, commonly known as the Guangdong clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in southern China. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
