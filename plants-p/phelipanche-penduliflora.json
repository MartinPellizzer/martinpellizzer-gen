    "intro": "Phelipanche penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink or purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from host plants, reflecting its hemiparasitic nature."
