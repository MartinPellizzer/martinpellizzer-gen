    "intro": "Phlomoides macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf phlomoides, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of purple or blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
