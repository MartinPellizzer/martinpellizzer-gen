    "intro": "Porpax reticosa, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, reticulated vein patterns on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a spike-like arrangement, with a distinctive coloration. Porpax reticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
