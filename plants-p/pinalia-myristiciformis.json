    "intro": "Pinalia myristiciformis, commonly known as the myristica-like pinalia, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a typical feature of many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pinalia myristiciformis is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
