    "intro": "Plantago vestita, commonly known as the silver plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by oval, nutlet-like seeds. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
