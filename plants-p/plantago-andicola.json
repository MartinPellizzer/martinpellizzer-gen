    "intro": "Plantago andicola, commonly known as the Andean plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive bract structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
