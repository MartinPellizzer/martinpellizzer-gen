    "intro": "Paspalum dilatatum subsp. flavescens, commonly known as yellow paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, pale yellow to golden inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
