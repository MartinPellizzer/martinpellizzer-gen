It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
