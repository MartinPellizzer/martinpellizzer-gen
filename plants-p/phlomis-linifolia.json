    "intro": "Phlomis linifolia, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the soft, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
