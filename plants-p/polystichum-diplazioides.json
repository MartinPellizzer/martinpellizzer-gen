    "intro": "Polystichum diplazioides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum diplazioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
