    "intro": "Phaenosperma globosum, commonly known as the globular sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruit that resembles a small ball, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Phaenosperma globosum is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
