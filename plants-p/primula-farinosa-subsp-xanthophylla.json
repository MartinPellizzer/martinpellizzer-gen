It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it the species name *farinosa*, meaning \"flour-like.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
