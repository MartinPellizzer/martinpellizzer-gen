    "intro": "Populus fremontii var. macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fluffy white flowers that appear in the spring. The tree typically grows along riparian zones, relying on water from rivers and streams for survival. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. This variety is adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
