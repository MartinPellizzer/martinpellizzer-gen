    "intro": "Pelargonium viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its sticky secretions on the leaves serve as a natural defense against herbivores. Pelargonium viscosissimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
