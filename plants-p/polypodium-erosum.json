    "intro": "Polypodium erosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a distinctive, serrated appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Polypodium erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
