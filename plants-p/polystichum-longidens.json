    "intro": "Polystichum longidens, commonly known as the long-leaf shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with long, narrow, and serrated leaflets. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum longidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its dense, lush foliage."
