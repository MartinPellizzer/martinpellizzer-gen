    "intro": "Pelecyphora alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's pelecyphora, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
