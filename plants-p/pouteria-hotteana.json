    "intro": "Pouteria hotteana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is most notable for its hard, woody fruit, which contains a single large seed surrounded by a fibrous pulp. The fruit matures over several months and is often harvested by hand or with the aid of tools. This plant plays a significant role in both ecological systems and local economies due to its valuable nut crop."
