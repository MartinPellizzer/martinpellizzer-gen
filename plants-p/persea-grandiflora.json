    "intro": "Persea grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or bigflower persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree bears edible fruit that is similar in appearance to the avocado but has a different flavor profile. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and culinary uses in its native regions."
