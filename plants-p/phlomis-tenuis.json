    "intro": "Phlomis tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Phlomis tenuis is drought-tolerant and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
