It features hairy, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or purple, typically blooming in summer. Its flowers are tubular at the base and gradually flare out, with five lobes at the mouth. Procris rugosa is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in full sun."
