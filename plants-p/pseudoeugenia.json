    "intro": "Pseudoeugenia, commonly known as the satinwood or false eugenia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are typically shrubs or small trees with aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Pseudoeugenia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their attractive foliage and fragrance."
