    "intro": "Papaver rupifragum, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to red, often with a dark central spot. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Papaver rupifragum is known for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
