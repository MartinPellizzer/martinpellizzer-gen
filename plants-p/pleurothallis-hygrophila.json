    "intro": "Pleurothallis hygrophila, commonly known as the water-loving orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous flowers. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be white, green, or yellow, are small but often fragrant, attracting various pollinators."
