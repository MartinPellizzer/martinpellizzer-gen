    "intro": "Picris repens, commonly known as common groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers are composed of ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Picris repens is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
