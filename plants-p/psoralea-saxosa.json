    "intro": "Psoralea saxosa, commonly known as the rock psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually small and pinnate, with a glandular surface that helps reduce water loss. Psoralea saxosa is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
