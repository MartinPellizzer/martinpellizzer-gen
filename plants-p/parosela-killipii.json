The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela killipii is considered a species of conservation concern."
