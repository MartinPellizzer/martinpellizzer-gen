    "intro": "Pentarrhaphis paupercula, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a graceful, cascading manner. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
