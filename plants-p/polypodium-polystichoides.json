    "intro": "Polypodium polystichoides, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in moist, well-drained soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium polystichoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and provides shelter for small invertebrates."
