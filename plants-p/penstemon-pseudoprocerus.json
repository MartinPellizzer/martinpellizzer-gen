    "intro": "Penstemon pseudoprocerus, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon pseudoprocerus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
