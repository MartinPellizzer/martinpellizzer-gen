    "intro": "Preonanthus alpinus subsp. apiifolius, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the carrot plant, giving it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
