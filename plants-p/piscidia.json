    "intro": "Piscidia, commonly known as the \"screwbean\" or \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted pods and showy, often yellow or red, flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Piscidia species are often shrubs or small trees, and they can grow in a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained conditions. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or for their use in traditional medicine."
