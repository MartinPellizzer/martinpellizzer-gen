    "intro": "Pinus calocote, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and longevity, often living for several centuries. The tree has a distinctive appearance with a gnarled trunk and a dense, conical crown. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and grow in bundles of five. The cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind."
