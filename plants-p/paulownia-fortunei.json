    "intro": "Paulownia fortunei, commonly known as the empress tree or royal paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are typically purple or pink in color. Its wood is lightweight, strong, and highly valued for its acoustic properties. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native species."
