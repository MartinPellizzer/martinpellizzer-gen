    "intro": "Phoradendron cuspidatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in pairs along the stems. Phoradendron cuspidatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can indicate the health of the host tree."
