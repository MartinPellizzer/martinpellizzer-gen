    "intro": "Polyrrhiza fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's coral tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, branched inflorescences that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
