    "intro": "Pleurothallis tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tepuis, or tabletop mountains, of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, requiring well-drained, organic substrates. Due to its restricted habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
