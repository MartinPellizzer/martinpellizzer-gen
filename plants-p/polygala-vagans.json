    "intro": "Polygala vagans, commonly known as the wandering pogonia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygalaceae. It is native to eastern North America, particularly found in moist woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers that are typically pink or lavender in color, with a unique structure that resembles a bird's beak. It thrives in partial shade and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
