    "intro": "Physiphora, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it is considered an invasive species. Physiphora thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control."
