    "intro": "Prunus communis foecundissima, commonly known as the wild cherry tree, is a species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The tree produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
