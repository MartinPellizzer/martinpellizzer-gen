    "intro": "Panicum tenacissimum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, reddish-brown inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a hardy choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to form a dense ground cover."
