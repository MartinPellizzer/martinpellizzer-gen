    "intro": "Polypodium flabelliferum, commonly known as the fan-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
