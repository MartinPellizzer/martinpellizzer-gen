    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
