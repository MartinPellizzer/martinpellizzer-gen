    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. spongifera, commonly known as the spongy wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive spongy texture, which contributes to its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is often found in association with other wetland vegetation and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
