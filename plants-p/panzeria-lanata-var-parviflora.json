    "intro": "Panzeria lanata var. parviflora, commonly known as the woolly panzeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
