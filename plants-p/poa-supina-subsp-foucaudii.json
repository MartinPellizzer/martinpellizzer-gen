    "intro": "Poa supina subsp. foucaudii, commonly known as the flatleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
