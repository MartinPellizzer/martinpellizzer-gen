    "intro": "Puya riparia, commonly known as the river puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that supports its ecological role in arid environments. Puya riparia is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions with minimal water."
