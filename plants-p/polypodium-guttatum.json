    "intro": "Polypodium guttatum, commonly known as the spotted shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery rachis and serrated leaflets. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium guttatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
