    "intro": "Pellaea andromedifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a species of fern found primarily in the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pellaea andromedifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
