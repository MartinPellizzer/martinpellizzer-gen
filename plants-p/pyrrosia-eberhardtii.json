    "intro": "Pyrrosia eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Pyrrosia eberhardtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in indoor gardens."
