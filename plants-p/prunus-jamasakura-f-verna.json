It is characterized by its early blooming period, typically in late winter or early spring, before most other cherry species. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink flowers that add a delicate ornamental effect to the landscape. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively hardy compared to other cherry varieties.
