    "intro": "Paspalum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum tenuifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
