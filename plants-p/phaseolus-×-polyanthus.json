    "intro": "Phaseolus \u00d7 polyanthus, commonly known as the ornamental pole bean, is a hybrid legume plant that combines traits from various Phaseolus species. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and the production of colorful, showy flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant's foliage is typically large and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. While it is primarily cultivated for its visual display, it can also produce edible beans, though these are generally less flavorful than those of other Phaseolus varieties. Its growth is best suited to warm climates and requires full sun and well-drained soil for optimal development."
