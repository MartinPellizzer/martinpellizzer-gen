    "intro": "Paepalanthus scopulorum var. auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears plant, is a rare bromeliad native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its striking, drooping inflorescences that resemble tears, often in shades of pink and red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires high humidity and indirect light. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette structure that holds water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
