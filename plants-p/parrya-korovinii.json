    "intro": "Parrya korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's parrya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
