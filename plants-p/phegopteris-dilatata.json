    "intro": "Phegopteris dilatata, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
