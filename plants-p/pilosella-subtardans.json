    "intro": "Pilosella subtardans, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella subtardans is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to cool, moist conditions."
