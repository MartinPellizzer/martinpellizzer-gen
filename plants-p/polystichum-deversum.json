    "intro": "Polystichum deversum, commonly known as the Devers' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The fronds are divided into narrow, serrated segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
