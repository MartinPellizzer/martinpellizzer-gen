    "intro": "Pyrus pannonica maculata, commonly known as the spotted pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves, which are usually dark green with reddish or brownish markings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to pears but typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
