It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a typical podocarp morphology, with needle-like leaves and a woody trunk that can reach significant heights. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
