    "intro": "Polypodium subtriquetrum, commonly known as the three-lobed cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its leaves are divided into three distinct lobes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
