    "intro": "Pseudopanax crassifolius var. trifoliolatus, commonly known as the three-leaf punga, is a unique evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant has a slow growth rate and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries. It is typically found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in New Zealand."
