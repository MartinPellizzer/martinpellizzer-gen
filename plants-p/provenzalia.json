    "intro": "Provenzalia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It consists of several species, including Provenzalia calycina and Provenzalia tinctoria, which are native to southern Europe and western Asia. These shrubs are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The fruits are typically small, dark berries that mature in the fall. Provenzalia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have been used historically in dye production."
