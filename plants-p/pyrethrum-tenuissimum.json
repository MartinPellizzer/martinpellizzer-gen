    "intro": "Pyrethrum tenuissimum, commonly known as narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the primary source of its natural insecticidal properties. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a distinct, aromatic scent. Pyrethrum tenuissimum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of botanical pesticides."
