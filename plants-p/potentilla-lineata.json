    "intro": "Potentilla lineata, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features wiry, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive scalloped or serrated edge. Potentilla lineata is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
