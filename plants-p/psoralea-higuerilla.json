    "intro": "Psoralea higuerilla, commonly known as the coastal psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Psoralea higuerilla is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to maritime environments."
