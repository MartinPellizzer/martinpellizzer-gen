    "intro": "Polystichum kunthianum, commonly known as the Kunth's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a papery indusium. Polystichum kunthianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
