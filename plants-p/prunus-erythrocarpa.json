    "intro": "Prunus erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Prunus erythrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
