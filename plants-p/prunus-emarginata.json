    "intro": "Prunus emarginata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its cold-hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates for both its aesthetic value and edible fruits."
