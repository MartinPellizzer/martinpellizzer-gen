    "intro": "Phegopteris luxurians, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has long, feathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive rhizome system that anchors it to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through spores. Phegopteris luxurians plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
