It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats near the shoreline."
