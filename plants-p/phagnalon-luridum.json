    "intro": "Phagnalon luridum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Phagnalon luridum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its habitat."
