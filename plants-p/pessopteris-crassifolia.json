It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Pessopteris crassifolia is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a living fossil."
