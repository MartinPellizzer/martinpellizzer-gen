    "intro": "Poecilopteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's cliff fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds and is often found in fossil records from the Late Cretaceous period. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, typical of advanced ferns, which allowed it to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinct patterns on the undersides of its leaves. Poecilopteris smithii provides important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleobotanical history of ancient ecosystems."
