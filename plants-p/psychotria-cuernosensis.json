    "intro": "Psychotria cuernosensis, commonly known as the horned psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture. Psychotria cuernosensis is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests."
