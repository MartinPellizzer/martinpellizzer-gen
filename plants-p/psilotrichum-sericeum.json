    "intro": "Psilotrichum sericeum, commonly known as the silky psilotum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
