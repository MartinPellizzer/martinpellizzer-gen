    "intro": "Plectranthus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian hedge or desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and ability to bloom throughout the growing season. Plectranthus arabicus also has historical uses in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
