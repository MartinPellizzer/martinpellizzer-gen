    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus f. iteratus, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a variant of the pondweed species native to cold, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Potamogetonaceae family. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in lakes and ponds in mountainous regions. This subspecies is adapted to low-temperature conditions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
