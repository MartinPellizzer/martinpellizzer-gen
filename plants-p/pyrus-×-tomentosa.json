    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 tomentosa, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a hybrid species within the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence on young shoots and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often with a rounded or irregular crown. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The fruit is a small, edible apple-like berry that ripens in late summer."
