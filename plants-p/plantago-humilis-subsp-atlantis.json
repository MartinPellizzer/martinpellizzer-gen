    "intro": "Plantago humilis subsp. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or coastal soils, making it an important species in dune ecosystems. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, with leaves traditionally used to treat skin irritations and digestive issues."
