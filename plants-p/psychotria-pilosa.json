It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks.
