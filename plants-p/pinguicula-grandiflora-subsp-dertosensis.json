    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos heath suntrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
