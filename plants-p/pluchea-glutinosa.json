It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green composite flowers and sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Pluchea glutinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
