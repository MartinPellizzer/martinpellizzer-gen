    "intro": "Palaquium canaliculatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming part of mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity."
