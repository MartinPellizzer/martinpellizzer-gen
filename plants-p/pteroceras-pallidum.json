    "intro": "Pteroceras pallidum, commonly known as the pale horned fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and the production of small, pale green to brownish fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often arise in a rosette formation. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
