    "intro": "Philodendron micans var. microphyllum, commonly known as the silver-veined philodendron, is a compact, vining plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking silver or white veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, though it is more commonly cultivated for its ornamental foliage than for its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
