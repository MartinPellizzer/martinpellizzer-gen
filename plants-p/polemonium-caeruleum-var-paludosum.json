    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum var. paludosum, commonly known as bluebells or marsh bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grows from rhizomes. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
