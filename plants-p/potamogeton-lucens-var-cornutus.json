    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens var. cornutus, commonly known as the horned pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves and distinctive, elongated spines on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and green, often hidden among the foliage, and it produces small, floating fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
