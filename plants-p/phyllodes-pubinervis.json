    "intro": "Phyllodes pubinervis, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The phyllodes are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. This plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
