It features glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia petiolata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
