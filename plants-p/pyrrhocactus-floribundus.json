    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus floribundus, commonly known as the showy pyrrhocactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
