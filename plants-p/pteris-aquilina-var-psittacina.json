It features delicate, bright green fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters along the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
