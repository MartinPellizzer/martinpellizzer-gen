    "intro": "Pitcairnia alta, commonly known as the highland air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
