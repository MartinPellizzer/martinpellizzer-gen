    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus superbus var. lanosior, commonly known as the woolly night blooming cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems for survival during droughts. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
