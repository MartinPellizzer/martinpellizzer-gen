    "intro": "Pelexia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, Pelexia foliosa is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
