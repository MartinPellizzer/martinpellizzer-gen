    "intro": "Phyteuma lanceolatum var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-gray underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique foliage and striking blooms contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
