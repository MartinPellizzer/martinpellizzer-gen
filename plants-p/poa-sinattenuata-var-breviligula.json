It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
