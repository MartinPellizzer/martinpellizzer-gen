    "intro": "Papaver tatricum subsp. tatricum, commonly known as the Carpathian poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers with a black center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
