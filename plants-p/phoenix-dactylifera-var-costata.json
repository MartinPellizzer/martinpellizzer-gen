    "intro": "Phoenix dactylifera var. costata, commonly known as the barhi date palm, is a variant of the date palm native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and wavy-textured leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces edible dates that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can be left to ripen for a sweeter flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications."
