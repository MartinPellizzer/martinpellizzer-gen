It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip and are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. This plant is often found in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils."
