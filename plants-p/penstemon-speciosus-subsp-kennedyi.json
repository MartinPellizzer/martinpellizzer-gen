It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, enhancing its ecological value."
