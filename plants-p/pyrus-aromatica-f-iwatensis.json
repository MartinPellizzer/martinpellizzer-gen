    "intro": "Pyrus aromatica f. iwatensis, commonly known as the Iwatanski pear, is a unique horticultural form of the European pear. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ornamental leaves that display a striking variegation of green and white. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the standard species. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions. This variety is particularly valued in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and genetic significance."
