    "intro": "Phacelia corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phacelia corrugata is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
