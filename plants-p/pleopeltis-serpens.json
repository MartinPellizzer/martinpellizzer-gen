    "intro": "Pleopeltis serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and often curling fronds that resemble a serpent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and can extend over considerable distances, allowing it to spread across its host. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in tropical climates."
