    "intro": "Pteris longipinnula var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the long-pinnate water fern. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
