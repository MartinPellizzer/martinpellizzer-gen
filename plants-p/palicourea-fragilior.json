    "intro": "Palicourea fragilior, commonly known as the delicate palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its fragility and specific environmental requirements."
