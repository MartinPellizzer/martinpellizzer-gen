    "intro": "Pneumatopteris auctipinna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has long, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swamps. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are capable of floating on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis and oxygen production."
