    "intro": "Pteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and often display a distinctive, wavy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread easily. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, tropical appearance."
