    "intro": "Phymatodes grossa, commonly known as the giant phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. Phymatodes grossa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
