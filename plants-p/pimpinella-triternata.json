    "intro": "Pimpinella triternata, commonly known as three-parted cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps that separate upon maturity. Pimpinella triternata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a herbaceous perennial."
