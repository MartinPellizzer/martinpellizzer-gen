    "intro": "Pellaea falcata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to South America. It features delicate, finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its elegant, miniature appearance."
