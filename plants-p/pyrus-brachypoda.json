    "intro": "Pyrus brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Pyrus brachypoda is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
