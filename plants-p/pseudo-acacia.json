    "intro": "Pseudo-acacia, commonly known as black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate with 14 to 20 leaflets, and its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in bird feed. It has a deep root system that makes it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
