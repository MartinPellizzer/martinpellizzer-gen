    "intro": "Pteris boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris boliviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
