    "intro": "Pernettya prostrata var. pentlandii, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
