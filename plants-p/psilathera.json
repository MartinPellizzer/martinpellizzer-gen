    "intro": "Psilathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often spiny leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical or cylindrical inflorescences and come in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Native to southern Africa, these plants are often found in rocky or arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
