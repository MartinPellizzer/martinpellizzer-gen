    "intro": "Polygonum polymorphum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum polymorphum var. alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
