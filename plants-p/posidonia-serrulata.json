    "intro": "Posidonia serrulata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a seagrass species native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea. It forms dense underwater meadows that play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water clarity. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through rhizomes, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Posidonia serrulata also provides essential habitat and food for various marine organisms."
