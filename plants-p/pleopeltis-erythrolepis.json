    "intro": "Pleopeltis erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a broad, spreading habit that enhances its ornamental appeal."
