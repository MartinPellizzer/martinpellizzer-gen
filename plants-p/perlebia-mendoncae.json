    "intro": "Perlebia mendoncae, commonly known as the Mendonca's perlebia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perlebia mendoncae is considered a species of conservation concern."
