    "intro": "Philodendron mayoi, commonly known as the Mayoi philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron mayoi is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
