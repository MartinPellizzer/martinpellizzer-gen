    "intro": "Pilosella hirticola, commonly known as the hairy pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. Pilosella hirticola is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
