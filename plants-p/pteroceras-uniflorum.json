It is a shrub characterized by its evergreen leaves and distinctive floral structure. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, which is typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
