    "intro": "Polystichum woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. Polystichum woronowii is often found in forest undergrowth, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
