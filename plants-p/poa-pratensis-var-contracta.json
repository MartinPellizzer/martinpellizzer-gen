It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit, making it well-suited for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern, with short, sturdy blades that are resistant to foot traffic. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers."
