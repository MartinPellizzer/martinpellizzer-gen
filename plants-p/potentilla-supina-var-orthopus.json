    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. orthopus, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in colder climates."
