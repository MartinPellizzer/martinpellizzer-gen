    "intro": "Pamplethantha viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered pamplethantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity. Due to habitat loss, Pamplethantha viridiflora is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
