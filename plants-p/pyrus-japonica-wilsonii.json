It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
