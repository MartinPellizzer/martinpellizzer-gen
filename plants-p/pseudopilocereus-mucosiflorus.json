    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus mucosiflorus, commonly known as the mucilage flower cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its stems are capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also noted for its ability to secrete a mucilaginous substance, which is used in traditional medicine."
