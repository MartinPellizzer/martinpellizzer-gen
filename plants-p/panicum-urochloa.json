    "intro": "Panicum urochloa, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, making it a visually striking plant. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish tint, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
