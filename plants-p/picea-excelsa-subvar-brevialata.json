    "intro": "Picea excelsa subvar. brevialata, commonly known as the short-winged white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact branches compared to the typical white spruce, which contributes to its unique appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive visual contrast against the mountainous terrain. This subvariety is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and cold temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine environments."
