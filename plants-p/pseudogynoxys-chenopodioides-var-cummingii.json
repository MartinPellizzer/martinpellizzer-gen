    "intro": "Pseudogynoxys chenopodioides var. cummingii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to store water and withstand high temperatures. The species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
