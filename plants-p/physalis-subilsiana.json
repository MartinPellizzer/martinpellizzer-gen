    "intro": "Physalis subilsiana, commonly known as the wild tomato or golden berry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are encased in a papery calyx, resembling a lantern. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it typically grows as an annual or biennial herb. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its tart, tangy taste."
