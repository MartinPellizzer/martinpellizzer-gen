    "intro": "Pseudolobivia nigra, commonly known as the black lobivia, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green to almost black stems, which are typically cylindrical and covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its dark foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pseudolobivia nigra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
