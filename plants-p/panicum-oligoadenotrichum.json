It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its inflorescence is characterized by a dense arrangement of bristle-like structures, which give it its scientific name. This species is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
