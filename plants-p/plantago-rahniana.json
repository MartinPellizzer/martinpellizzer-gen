    "intro": "Plantago rahniana, commonly known as the Rahn's plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
