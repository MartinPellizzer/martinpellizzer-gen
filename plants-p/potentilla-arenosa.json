    "intro": "Potentilla arenosa, commonly known as the sand cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Potentilla arenosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
