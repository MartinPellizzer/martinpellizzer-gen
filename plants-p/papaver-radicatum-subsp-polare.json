    "intro": "Papaver radicatum subsp. polare, commonly known as Arctic poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the short growing season of polar environments. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with dark green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold climates. Its flowers typically open in late spring or early summer, often in response to the midnight sun. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
