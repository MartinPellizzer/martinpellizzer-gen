    "intro": "Pachylarnax, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help buoyancy, while the roots anchor the plant in the muddy substrate."
