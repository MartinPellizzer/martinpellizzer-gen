    "intro": "Pinus recurvata, commonly known as the Mexican red pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest ecosystems in its native range."
