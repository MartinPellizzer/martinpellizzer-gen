    "intro": "Poivrea obscura var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely foliaged structure and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
