    "intro": "Picea abies f. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping Norway spruce, is a unique form of the Norway spruce characterized by its low-growing, mat-like growth habit. It features dense, dark green foliage with short, stiff needles that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky or barren areas."
