    "intro": "Poa crispa, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per stem. Poa crispa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is due to its delicate appearance and ability to form a lush, low-growing turf."
