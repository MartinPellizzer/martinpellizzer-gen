    "intro": "Pyrus hajastana, commonly known as the Armenian whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. It is adapted to rocky and mountainous environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
