    "intro": "Pteris shimianensis, commonly known as the Shimian water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
