    "intro": "Pyrus foliolosa var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered pear, is a variant of the foliolosa pear species. It is characterized by its distinctive red-pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential for fruit production, though the fruits are generally small and not widely cultivated."
