It is a perennial species that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as meadows and slopes. The plant features tall, erect stems with clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
