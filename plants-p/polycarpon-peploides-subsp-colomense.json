    "intro": "Polycarpon peploides subsp. colomense, commonly known as the Andean sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss, a trait common in alpine flora. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
