    "intro": "Penstemon coccinatus, commonly known as the scarlet penstemon, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodland or mountainous areas. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Penstemon coccinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
