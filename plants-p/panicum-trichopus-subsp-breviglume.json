    "intro": "Panicum trichopus subsp. breviglume, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait in grasses. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter glumes compared to other subspecies of Panicum trichopus."
