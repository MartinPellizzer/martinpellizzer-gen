    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. locyana, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
