    "intro": "Platanthera clavellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in areas with ample sunlight. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays an important role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
