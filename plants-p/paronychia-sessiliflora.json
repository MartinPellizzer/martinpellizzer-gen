    "intro": "Paronychia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
