It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching at the base. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in whorls around the stem. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
