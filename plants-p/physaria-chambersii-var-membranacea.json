    "intro": "Physaria chambersii var. membranacea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces bright yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
