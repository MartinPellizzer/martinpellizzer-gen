    "intro": "Pueraria tetragona, commonly known as kudzu, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple to white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate ecosystems. Its roots contain high levels of starch, making it a valuable resource in traditional medicine and as a food source. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread."
