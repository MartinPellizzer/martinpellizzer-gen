    "intro": "Pseudotragia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa and is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. The plants typically produce showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink, red, or orange in color. Many species of Pseudotragia are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and resilience."
