    "intro": "Poa arnoldii, commonly known as Arnold's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelets that produce minute seeds. Poa arnoldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
