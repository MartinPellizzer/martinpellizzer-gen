    "intro": "Prasophyllum frenchii, commonly known as the French's leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, often in areas with dense vegetation. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, narrow, grass-like leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a loose spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Prasophyllum frenchii is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to the hydrological conditions of its habitat."
