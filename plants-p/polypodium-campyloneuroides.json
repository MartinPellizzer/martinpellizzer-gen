    "intro": "Polypodium campyloneuroides, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium campyloneuroides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soil."
