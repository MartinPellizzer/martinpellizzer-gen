    "intro": "Phegopteris vulgaris, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments. Phegopteris vulgaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
