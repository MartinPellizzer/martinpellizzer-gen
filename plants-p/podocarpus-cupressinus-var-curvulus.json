It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age.
