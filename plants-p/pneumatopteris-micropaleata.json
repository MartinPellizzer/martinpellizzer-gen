    "intro": "Pneumatopteris micropaleata, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, and its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Pneumatopteris micropaleata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
