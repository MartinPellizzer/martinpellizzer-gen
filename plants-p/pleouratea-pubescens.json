    "intro": "Pleouratea pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pleouratea pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
