    "intro": "Palicourea grandiceps, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and often have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and vigorous growth habit."
