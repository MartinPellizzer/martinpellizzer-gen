    "intro": "Pilosocereus flexibilispinus, commonly known as the flexible hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring spiny, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. Pilosocereus flexibilispinus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking visual appeal."
