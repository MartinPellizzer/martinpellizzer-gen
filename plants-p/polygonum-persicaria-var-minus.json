    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria var. minus, commonly known as narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Polygonum persicaria."
