    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus subochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The leaves are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and function."
