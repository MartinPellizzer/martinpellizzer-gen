    "intro": "Potentilla gordonii var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Gordon cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
