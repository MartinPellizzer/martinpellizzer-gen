    "intro": "Polygala subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala subulata is often found in open vegetation types such as savannas and shrublands."
