    "intro": "Primula lacerata, commonly known as the shredded primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are notably wrinkled and lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost shredded appearance. Primula lacerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest blooms."
