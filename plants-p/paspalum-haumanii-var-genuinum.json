    "intro": "Paspalum haumanii var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaf size and more compact growth habit compared to other paspalum species."
