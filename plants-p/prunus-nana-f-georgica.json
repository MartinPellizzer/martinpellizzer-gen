    "intro": "Prunus nana f. georgica, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or the Alaska dwarf cherry, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in gardens."
