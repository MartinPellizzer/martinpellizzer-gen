    "intro": "Parnassia cirrata var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Parnassia, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that resemble those of the moon, giving it a mystical appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually oval and slightly hairy, and they often emit a faint, sweet fragrance. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly larger flowers and more elongated petals."
