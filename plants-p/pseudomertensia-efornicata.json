    "intro": "Pseudomertensia efornicata, commonly known as the golden crown bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, forming bell-shaped clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
