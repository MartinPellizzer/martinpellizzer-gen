    "intro": "Pinus viminalis, commonly known as the basket willow or sweet willow, is a species of pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is lightweight and flexible, making it suitable for basket-making and other traditional crafts. The tree is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
