It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, elongated pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
