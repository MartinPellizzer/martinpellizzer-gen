    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. deseglisei, commonly known as the Deseglise pear, is a rare and ancient variety of pear native to France. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a yellowish-green skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with broad, lobed leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in preserving heirloom plant varieties."
