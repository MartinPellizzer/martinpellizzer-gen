    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii var. levieri, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a dense mat of narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
