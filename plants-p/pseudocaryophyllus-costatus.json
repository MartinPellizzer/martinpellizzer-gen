    "intro": "Pseudocaryophyllus costatus, commonly known as the costate pseudocaryophyllus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Native to regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
