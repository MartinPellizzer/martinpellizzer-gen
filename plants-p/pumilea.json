    "intro": "Pumilea, commonly known as the \"starfish cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plants typically have a short, thick stem with clusters of spiny areoles, and their leaves are often reduced to spines. Pumilea species are well adapted to dry environments, storing water in their stems and roots. They are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
