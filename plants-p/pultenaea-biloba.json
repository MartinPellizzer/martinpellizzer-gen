    "intro": "Pultenaea biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bush vetch, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and dry inland regions, often found in heathlands and sand dunes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that can branch out extensively. Pultenaea biloba is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
