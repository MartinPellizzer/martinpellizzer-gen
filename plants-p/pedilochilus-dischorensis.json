    "intro": "Pedilochilus dischorensis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
