    "intro": "Pyrus borbasii, commonly known as the Borbasii pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Caucasus region. It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5-8 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and clustered in cymes. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear with a smooth skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
