It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa setacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
