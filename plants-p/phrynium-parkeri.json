    "intro": "Phrynium parkeri, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Phrynium parkeri is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
