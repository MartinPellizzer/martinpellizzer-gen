    "intro": "Panax bastardianus, commonly known as the bastard ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and medicinal value, it is highly sought after and faces significant conservation challenges."
