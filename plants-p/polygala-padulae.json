    "intro": "Polygala padulae, commonly known as the marsh milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
