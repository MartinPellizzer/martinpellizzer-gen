    "intro": "Phymatopteris tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan wall-rhizome fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and the sori are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptation to high-altitude conditions make it an important component of the local flora."
