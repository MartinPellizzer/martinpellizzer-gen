It is characterized by its unique, tubular flower that resembles a honeycomb, which is typically yellow with purple markings. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few broad, linear leaves. It blooms during the cooler months, usually from August to November. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
