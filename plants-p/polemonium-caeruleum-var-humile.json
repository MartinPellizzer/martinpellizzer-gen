    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf bluebells, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are usually unbranched. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. This variety is smaller than the typical Polemonium caeruleum, with shorter stems and smaller flowers."
