    "intro": "Physurus pictus var. reticularis, commonly known as the red-tailed tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red tail and green body with intricate patterns. The plant in question, however, is not a plant but an animal, specifically a frog. Therefore, it does not have botanical aspects. I can't reply."
