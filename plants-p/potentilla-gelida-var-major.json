    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. major, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to cold, alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, palmate leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
