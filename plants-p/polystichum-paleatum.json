    "intro": "Polystichum paleatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale, silvery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a feathery appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
