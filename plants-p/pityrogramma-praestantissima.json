    "intro": "Pityrogramma praestantissima, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodiaceae fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, bright green leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
