    "intro": "Pandanus biceps, commonly known as the two-branched pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, but it also plays an ecological role in stabilizing coastal areas."
