    "intro": "Paspalum supinum, commonly known as creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, bisexual flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Paspalum supinum is commonly found in wetland habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native environments."
