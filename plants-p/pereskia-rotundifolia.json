    "intro": "Pereskia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved cactus, is a unique species belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems for water storage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are rounded and typically fall off as the plant matures, giving it a more shrub-like appearance. Pereskia rotundifolia is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
