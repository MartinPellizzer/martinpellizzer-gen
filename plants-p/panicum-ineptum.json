It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
