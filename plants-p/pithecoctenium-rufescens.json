    "intro": "Pithecoctenium rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, reddish stems that often exhibit a reddish hue, especially in younger growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential forage plant for livestock."
