It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in shrubland or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
