    "intro": "Primula redolens, commonly known as the fragrant primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
