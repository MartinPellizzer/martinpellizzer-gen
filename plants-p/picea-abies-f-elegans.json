    "intro": "Picea abies f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant Norway spruce, is a cultivated form of the Norway spruce (Picea abies). It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and finely dissected, feathery foliage. The leaves are typically longer and more delicate compared to the typical Norway spruce, giving it a more refined appearance. This form is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
