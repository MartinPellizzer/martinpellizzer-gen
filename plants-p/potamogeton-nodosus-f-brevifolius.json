    "intro": "Potamogeton nodosus f. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved pondweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Potamogetonaceae. It is characterized by its compact, submersed growth habit and narrow, short leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often found in shallow freshwater habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving waters. This subspecies is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and its sensitivity to water quality changes."
