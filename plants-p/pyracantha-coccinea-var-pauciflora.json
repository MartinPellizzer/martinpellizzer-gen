    "intro": "Pyracantha coccinea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the scarlet firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, orange-red flowers in spring. The plant is notable for its showy, orange-red berries that persist through winter, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Due to its attractive foliage and fruit, it is often used in landscaping for hedging or as a specimen plant."
