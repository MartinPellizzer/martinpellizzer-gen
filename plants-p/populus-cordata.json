    "intro": "Populus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a distinctive serrated margin. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The bark of Populus cordata is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing."
