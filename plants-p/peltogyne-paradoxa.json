    "intro": "Peltogyne paradoxa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones. The plant has a thick, fibrous bark that contains tannins and is used in traditional medicine. Its small, pale pink flowers are followed by elliptical, winged fruits that disperse via water. Peltogyne paradoxa plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine and terrestrial species."
