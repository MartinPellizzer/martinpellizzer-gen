    "intro": "Prasophyllum horburyanum, commonly known as the Horbury leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect spike of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a summer-growing species, flowering from late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
