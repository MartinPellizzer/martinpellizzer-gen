    "intro": "Pyxidium retroflexum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white or pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Pyxidium retroflexum is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing sandy or rocky habitats."
