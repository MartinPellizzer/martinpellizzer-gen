    "intro": "Polypodium typicum, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Polypodium typicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
