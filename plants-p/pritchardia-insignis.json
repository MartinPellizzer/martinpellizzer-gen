    "intro": "Pritchardia insignis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and introduced pests, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
