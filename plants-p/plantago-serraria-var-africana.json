    "intro": "Plantago serraria var. africana, commonly known as African plantain, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous roots and leaves make it a useful plant for erosion control and traditional medicine."
