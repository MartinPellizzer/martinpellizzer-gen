    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. singularis, commonly known as the single-flowered cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its solitary, showy flowers that appear on short, erect pedicels, distinguishing it from the typical clustered blossoms of other cherry varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are pink to white and are highly valued for ornamental purposes in gardens."
