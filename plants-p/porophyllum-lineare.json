    "intro": "Porophyllum lineare, commonly known as the linearleaf fleabane, is an annual flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a hairy stem that helps reduce water loss. Porophyllum lineare is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
