It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft substrates, often found in lakes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
