    "intro": "Plantago macrostachys var. denudata, commonly known as the naked plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on elongated spikes. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished from other plantago species by its reduced leaf hairs and overall more rugged appearance."
