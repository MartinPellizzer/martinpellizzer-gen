    "intro": "Paraboea peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States, particularly in California. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. It has small, oval leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
