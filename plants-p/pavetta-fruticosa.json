    "intro": "Pavetta fruticosa, commonly known as the African velvet bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round fruits that are typically reddish in color. Pavetta fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
