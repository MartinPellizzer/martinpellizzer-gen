    "intro": "Poa caesia subsp. briquetii, commonly known as the Briquet's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright culms with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and color."
