    "intro": "Papualthia mollis, commonly known as the soft papua orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
