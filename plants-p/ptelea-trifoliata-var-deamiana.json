    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. deamiana, commonly known as the Deam's threeleaf, is a rare variant of the threeleaf sumac. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
