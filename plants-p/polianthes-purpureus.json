    "intro": "Polianthes purpureus, commonly known as the purple grass of the Andes, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, purple flowers. It thrives in cool, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
