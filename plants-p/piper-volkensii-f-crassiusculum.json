    "intro": "Piper volkensii f. crassiusculum, commonly known as the thick-leaved pepper plant, is a compact shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and thicker than those of the typical *Piper volkensii*. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
