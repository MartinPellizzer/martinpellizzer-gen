    "intro": "Pitcairnia monticola, commonly known as the mountain pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, violet-colored inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
