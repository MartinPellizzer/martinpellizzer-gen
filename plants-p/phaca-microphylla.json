It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in small pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
