    "intro": "Polypodium dendricola, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in height. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on trees or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and woody, serving as a storage organ and anchoring the plant. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
