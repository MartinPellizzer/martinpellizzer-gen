It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
