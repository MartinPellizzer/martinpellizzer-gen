    "intro": "Palicourea australis, commonly known as the Australian palicourea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, dark green foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.
