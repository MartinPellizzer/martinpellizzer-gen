It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, attracting various bird species. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in shaded gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
