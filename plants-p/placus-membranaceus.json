    "intro": "Placus membranaceus, commonly known as the delicate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the main photosynthetic organs are the bladder-like bladders. Placus membranaceus is known for its unique method of nutrient acquisition through active predation."
