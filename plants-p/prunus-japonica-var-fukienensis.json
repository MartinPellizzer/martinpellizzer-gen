It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, reddish fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions. The Fukien cherry is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in temperate climates."
