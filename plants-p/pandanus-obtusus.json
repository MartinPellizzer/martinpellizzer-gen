    "intro": "Pandanus obtusus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. Pandanus obtusus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
