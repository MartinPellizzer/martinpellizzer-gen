    "intro": "Populus betulifolia, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Populus betulifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in forest ecosystems."
