    "intro": "Pteris zygophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris zygophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
