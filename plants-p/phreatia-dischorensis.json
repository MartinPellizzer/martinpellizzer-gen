It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within lowland forests. The plant features a pseudobulb and produces showy, fragrant flowers in a range of colors including white, yellow, and orange. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
