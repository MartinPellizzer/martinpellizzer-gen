    "intro": "Polypodium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with rounded, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Polypodium rotundatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
