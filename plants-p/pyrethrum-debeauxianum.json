    "intro": "Pyrethrum debeauxianum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins. These compounds make it effective for pest control in organic gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal use."
