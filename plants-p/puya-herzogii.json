    "intro": "Puya herzogii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which stores water in arid environments. Its vibrant red and orange flowers bloom at the top of the plant, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Puya herzogii is well adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of the Andean highlands."
