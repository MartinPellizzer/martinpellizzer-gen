It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is a perennial species that produces numerous small flowers along its stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
