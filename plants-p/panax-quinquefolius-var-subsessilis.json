    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius var. subsessilis, commonly known as the short-stemmed American ginseng, is a variant of the American ginseng plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its shorter stem and smaller leaves compared to the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. Its root system is similar to other ginseng species, consisting of a central root with branched offshoots. This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it is less commonly cultivated than the standard American ginseng."
