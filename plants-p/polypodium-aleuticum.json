    "intro": "Polypodium aleuticum, commonly known as the Aleutian huperzia, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of North America and Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain attached to the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
