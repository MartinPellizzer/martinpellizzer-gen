    "intro": "Pleurothallis ineziae, commonly known as the Inezia orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
