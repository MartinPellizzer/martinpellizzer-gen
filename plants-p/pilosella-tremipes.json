It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by white or pale blue ray florets, giving it a delicate appearance. Pilosella tremipes is often found in meadows and open woodlands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
