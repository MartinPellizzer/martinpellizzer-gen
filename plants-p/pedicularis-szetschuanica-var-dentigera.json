    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica var. dentigera, commonly known as the toothed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and branched. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
