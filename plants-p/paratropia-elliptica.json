It is native to Australia and is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
