    "intro": "Plantago lasioneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as along stream banks and in marshy areas. Plantago lasioneura is often used in traditional medicine and is known for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
