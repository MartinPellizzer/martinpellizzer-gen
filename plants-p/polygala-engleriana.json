It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its unique floral structure and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
