    "intro": "Pentaphragma winitii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in ornamental water gardens."
