    "intro": "Polygala amara subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lady's-tongue, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
