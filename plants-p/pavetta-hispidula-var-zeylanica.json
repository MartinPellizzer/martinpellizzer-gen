    "intro": "Pavetta hispidula var. zeylanica, commonly known as the hairy pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features simple, opposite, elliptic leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dry seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
