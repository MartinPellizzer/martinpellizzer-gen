    "intro": "Peperomia hispidula var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
