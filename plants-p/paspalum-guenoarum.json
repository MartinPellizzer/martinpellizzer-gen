    "intro": "Paspalum guenoarum, commonly known as Guenoarum grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist or wetland environments, thriving in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
