    "intro": "Potentilla gusuleacii f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate shrub cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a perennial species that spreads through both rhizomes and seed, forming dense ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
