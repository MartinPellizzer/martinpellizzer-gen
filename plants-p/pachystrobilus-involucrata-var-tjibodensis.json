    "intro": "Pachystrobilus involucrata var. tjibodensis, commonly known as the Tjibod\u00e9 cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
