It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, flat, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
