    "intro": "Paphiopedilum callosum var. potentianum, commonly known as the White Lady Paphiopedilum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a pouch, a characteristic feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a yellow or greenish throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often grown in greenhouses or as a potted plant due to its specific care requirements."
