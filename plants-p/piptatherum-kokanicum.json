    "intro": "Piptatherum kokanicum, commonly known as the mountain grass or Kokan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
