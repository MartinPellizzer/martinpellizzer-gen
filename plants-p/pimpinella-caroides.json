    "intro": "Pimpinella caroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a dry, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Pimpinella caroides is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
