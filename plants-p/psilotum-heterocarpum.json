    "intro": "Psilotum heterocarpum, commonly known as the heterocarpous clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and the absence of true leaves, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces two types of spores\u2014microspores and megaspores\u2014on separate sporophylls, a feature that gives it its specific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Psilotum heterocarpum is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
