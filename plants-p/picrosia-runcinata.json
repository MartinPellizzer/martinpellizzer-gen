    "intro": "Picrosia runcinata, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with five sepals and no petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
