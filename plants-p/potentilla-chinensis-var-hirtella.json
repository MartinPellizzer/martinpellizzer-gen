    "intro": "Potentilla chinensis var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
