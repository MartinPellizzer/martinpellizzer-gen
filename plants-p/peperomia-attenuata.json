    "intro": "Peperomia attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia attenuata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
