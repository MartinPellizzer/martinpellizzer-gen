    "intro": "Paliurus texanus, commonly known as Texas palo blanco, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pale white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental features, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
