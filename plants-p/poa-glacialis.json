    "intro": "Poa glacialis, commonly known as glacier grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions and tundra. Poa glacialis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
