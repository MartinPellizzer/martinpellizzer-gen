    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. ferruginea, commonly known as the Chinese tamarisk or the ironwood poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
