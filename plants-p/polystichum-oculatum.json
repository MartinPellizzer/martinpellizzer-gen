    "intro": "Polystichum oculatum, commonly known as the eye fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum oculatum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
