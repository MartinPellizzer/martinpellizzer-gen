    "intro": "Panicum cayennense var. campestre, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bright green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important species in ecological landscapes."
