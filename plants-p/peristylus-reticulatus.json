    "intro": "Peristylus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined peristylus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
