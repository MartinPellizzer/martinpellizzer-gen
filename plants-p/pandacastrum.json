    "intro": "Pandacastrum, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant blooms that open at night and close by dawn. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
