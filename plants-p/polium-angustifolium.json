    "intro": "Polium angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Polium angustifolium is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and birds."
