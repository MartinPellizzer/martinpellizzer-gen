    "intro": "Phegopteris germaniana, commonly known as the German water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Pteridaceae. It is a delicate, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates in water, while its spores are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
