    "intro": "Petasites frigidus subsp. sagittatus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various insects and small mammals."
