    "intro": "Pinus thunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark, rugged bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and covered with bracts, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance. The Japanese black pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
