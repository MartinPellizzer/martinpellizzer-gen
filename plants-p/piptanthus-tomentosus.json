    "intro": "Piptanthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly podded broom, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorned branches and small, oval-shaped leaves covered in a soft, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
