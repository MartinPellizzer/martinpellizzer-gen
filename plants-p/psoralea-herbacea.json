It is a small, herbaceous annual or perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often linear or lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems. Psoralea herbacea is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
