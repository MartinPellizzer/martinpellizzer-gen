It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. The subspecies sudrei is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different growth habit compared to other Phillyrea species."
