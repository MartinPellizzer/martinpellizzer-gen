It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variant is often found in tundra and mountainous environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
