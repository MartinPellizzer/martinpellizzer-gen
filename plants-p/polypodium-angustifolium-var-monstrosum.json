    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. monstrosum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaved huperzia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is notable for its robust growth and distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
