    "intro": "Pitcairnia sordida, commonly known as the dirty pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vivid contrast to its foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts."
