    "intro": "Piper hastularum var. longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled pepper plant, is a variant of the black pepper plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. The plant produces small, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and it bears clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into red berries. The berries are harvested when fully mature and dried to produce the spice known as long pepper. This variety is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
