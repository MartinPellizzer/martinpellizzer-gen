    "intro": "Pyrus chadwellii, commonly known as Chadwell's pear, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are similar to pears. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture and a distinct serrated edge. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pyrus chadwellii is considered a critically endangered species."
