It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, usually green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
