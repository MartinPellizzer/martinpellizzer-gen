    "intro": "Peperomia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges, giving it an attractive, variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are typically borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia suaveolens is a low-maintenance plant well-suited for indoor cultivation."
