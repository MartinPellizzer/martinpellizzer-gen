    "intro": "Phacelia pratensis, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, oblong seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Phacelia pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
