    "intro": "Prospero corsicum, commonly known as the Corsican prospero, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mediterranean island of Corsica. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and it produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers during the spring. Prospero corsicum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal environments of Corsica. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
