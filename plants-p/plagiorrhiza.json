    "intro": "Plagiorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that often appear to be suspended in mid-air. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize effectively on its own. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, with a striking, almost translucent appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Plagiorrhiza is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
