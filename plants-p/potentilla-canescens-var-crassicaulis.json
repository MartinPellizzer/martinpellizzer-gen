    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features wiry, often hairy stems and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that are covered in fine, white pubescence. This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
