    "intro": "Polygala timoutou, commonly known as the Madagascar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
