    "intro": "Polygala linarifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its common name. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
