    "intro": "Passerina pendula, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that hang from slender stems, often displaying shades of blue or violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Passerina pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
