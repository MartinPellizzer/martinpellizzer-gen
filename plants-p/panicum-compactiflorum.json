    "intro": "Panicum compactiflorum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
