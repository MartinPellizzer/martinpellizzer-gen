    "intro": "Primula forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
