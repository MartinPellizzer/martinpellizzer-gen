    "intro": "Papaver cornutum, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like seed pods that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers with a papery texture, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Papaver cornutum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
