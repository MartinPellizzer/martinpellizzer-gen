    "intro": "Pteris allosora, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often have a wavy or crested appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Pteris allosora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
