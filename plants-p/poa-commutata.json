    "intro": "Poa commutata, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a fine texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in shady or wet conditions. Poa commutata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
