It features wiry, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall silvery sheen. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
