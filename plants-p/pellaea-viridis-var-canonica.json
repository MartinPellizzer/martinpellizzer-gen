    "intro": "Pellaea viridis var. canonica, commonly known as the Canonica maidenhair fern, is a variant of the green maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
