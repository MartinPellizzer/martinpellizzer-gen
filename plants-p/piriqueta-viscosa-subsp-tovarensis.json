    "intro": "Piriqueta viscosa subsp. tovarensis, commonly known as the sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal and mountainous areas. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat."
