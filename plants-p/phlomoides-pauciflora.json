It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
