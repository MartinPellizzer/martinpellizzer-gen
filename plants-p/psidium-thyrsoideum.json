It produces small, edible berries that are rich in nutrients and have a tart, sweet flavor. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The flowers are white and clustered, giving way to the characteristic red or yellow berries that ripen in late summer."
