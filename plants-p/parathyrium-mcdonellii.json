    "intro": "Parathyrium mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonald's parathyrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
