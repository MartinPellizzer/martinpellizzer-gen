    "intro": "Phytolacca gracilis, commonly known as slender pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
