    "intro": "Pseudotectaria, commonly known as the false tectaria, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their palm-like appearance, with a single trunk and large, compound leaves. Pseudotectaria species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and unique growth form."
