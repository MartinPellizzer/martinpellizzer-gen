    "intro": "Potentilla leiophylla, commonly known as the lowleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Potentilla leiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
