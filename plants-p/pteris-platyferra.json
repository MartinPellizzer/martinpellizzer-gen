    "intro": "Pteris platyferra, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released in clusters known as sori. Pteris platyferra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
