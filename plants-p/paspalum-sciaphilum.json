    "intro": "Paspalum sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate low light conditions and poor soil drainage. Paspalum sciaphilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
