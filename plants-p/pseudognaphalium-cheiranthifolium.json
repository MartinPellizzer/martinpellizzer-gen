    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium cheiranthifolium, commonly known as the leafy everlasting or false everlasting, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Pseudognaphalium cheiranthifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
