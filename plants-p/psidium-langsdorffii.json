    "intro": "Psidium langsdorffii, commonly known as the Brazilian guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Psidium langsdorffii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the consumption of its fruit in local cuisines."
