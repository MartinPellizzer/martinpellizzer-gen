    "intro": "Prenia englishiae, commonly known as the English island plant, is a rare flowering plant native to a small region in the British Isles. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prenia englishiae is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
