    "intro": "Pothos umbraculifera, commonly known as the Indian ivy or elephant's ear vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative vine in indoor and outdoor settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and hanging baskets."
