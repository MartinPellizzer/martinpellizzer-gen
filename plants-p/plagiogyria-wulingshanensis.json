    "intro": "Plagiogyria wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling Mountains plagiogyria, is a rare and endemic moss species native to the Wuling Mountains in China. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, acrocarpous growth form. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like structure with tightly appressed leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
