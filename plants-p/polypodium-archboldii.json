    "intro": "Polypodium archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in renal-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium archboldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
