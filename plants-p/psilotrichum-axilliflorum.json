    "intro": "Psilotrichum axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered psilotrichum, is a rare and unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the axils of its stems, a feature that distinguishes it from many other ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
