    "intro": "Priestleya graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family, native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to form clumps, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, which contributes to its common name, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, sandy soils. Priestleya graminifolia is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
