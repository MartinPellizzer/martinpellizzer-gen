    "intro": "Podocarpus bidwillii, commonly known as the satinwood or blackwood, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like structures. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a narrow, conical crown. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, and it produces both male and female cones, typical of conifers. The wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in native forestry."
