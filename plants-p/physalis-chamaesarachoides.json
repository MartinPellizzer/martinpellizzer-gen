It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encases the fruit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that turn red when mature, resembling tiny tomatoes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. The species is often used in traditional medicine and is of interest for its potential horticultural and ecological value."
