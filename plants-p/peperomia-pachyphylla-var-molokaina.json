It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving the plant a compact and dense appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
