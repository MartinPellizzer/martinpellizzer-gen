    "intro": "Pycnocephalum, commonly known as the dense-headed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense flower heads that resemble small, clustered heads, hence its common name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often yellow or white in color. Pycnocephalum species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. These plants are generally low-growing and serve as food sources for certain insects and small animals."
