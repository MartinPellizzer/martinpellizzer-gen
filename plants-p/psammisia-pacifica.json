    "intro": "Psammisia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California and Oregon. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psammisia pacifica plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinators."
