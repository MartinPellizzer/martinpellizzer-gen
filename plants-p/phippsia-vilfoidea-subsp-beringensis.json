    "intro": "Phippsia vilfoidea subsp. beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia and Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to permafrost conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among Arctic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss."
