    "intro": "Pedicularis hookeriana, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
