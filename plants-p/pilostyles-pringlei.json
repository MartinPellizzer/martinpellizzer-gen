    "intro": "Pilostyles pringlei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant found in the Andes of South America. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant is notable for its intricate, thread-like structure and its ability to produce a single, ephemeral flower that blooms for only a few hours. Its reproductive strategy involves attracting specific pollinators with its brief flowering period. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Pilostyles pringlei is considered a vulnerable species."
