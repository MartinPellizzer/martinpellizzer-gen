    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora var. depressa, commonly known as the mat groundcherry, is a low-growing annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The fruit, which is a small, round capsule, contains seeds that are easily dispersed by wind."
