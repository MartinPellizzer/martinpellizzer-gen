    "intro": "Pachyphyllum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening in dry climates."
