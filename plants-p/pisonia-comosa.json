    "intro": "Pisonia comosa, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Pisonia comosa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
