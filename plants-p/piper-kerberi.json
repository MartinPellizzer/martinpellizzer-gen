    "intro": "Piper kerberi, commonly known as the Kerber's pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the alkaloid piperine, which gives it a spicy flavor. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical structure features opposite leaves and unisexual flowers, typical of the Piper genus."
