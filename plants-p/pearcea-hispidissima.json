    "intro": "Pearcea hispidissima, commonly known as the rough pearcea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pearcea hispidissima is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
