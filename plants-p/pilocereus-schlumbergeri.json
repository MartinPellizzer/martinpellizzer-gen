    "intro": "Pilocereus schlumbergeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is known for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. Pilocereus schlumbergeri is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
