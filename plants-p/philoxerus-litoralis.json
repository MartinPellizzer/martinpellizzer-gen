    "intro": "Philoxerus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal lantana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to saline and well-drained conditions, making it resilient to coastal environments. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid or windy conditions."
