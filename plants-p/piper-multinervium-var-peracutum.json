    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. peracutum, commonly known as the narrow-veined pepper plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. The variety peracutum is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaflets and narrower veins compared to the typical form of Piper multinervium."
