    "intro": "Populus heteroloba, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Populus genus. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin strips. Populus heteroloba is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a significant role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
