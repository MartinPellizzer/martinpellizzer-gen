    "intro": "Panicum globulare, commonly known as globular panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive, rounded appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
