    "intro": "Pleopeltis incurvata, commonly known as the curved lip fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, recurved fronds that often form dense, compact clumps. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
