    "intro": "Pinus radiata, commonly known as the Monterey pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the central coast of California and the western coast of Chile. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its timber and is also valued for its role in reforestation projects. Pinus radiata is adapted to coastal climates and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
