    "intro": "Prunus sativa subvar. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stem cherry, is a unique variant of the Prunus sativa species. This plant is characterized by its lack of leafy stems, which distinguishes it from other cherry varieties. It typically produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet drupe that ripens in late summer. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized botanical specimen."
