    "intro": "Plantago cynops subsp. asperrima, commonly known as the rough-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
