    "intro": "Phlomis longifolia, commonly known as longleaf phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of pink to purple flowers in the summer months. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phlomis longifolia is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
