    "intro": "Poa campbellensis, commonly known as Campbell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa campbellensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
