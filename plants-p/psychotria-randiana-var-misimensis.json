    "intro": "Psychotria randiana var. misimensis, commonly known as the \"Yopo\" or \"San Pedro\" plant, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of tropical forests. This variant is notable for its use in traditional shamanic practices due to its hallucinogenic properties."
