    "intro": "Peperomia arifolia, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture and often feature intricate patterns or variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia arifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
