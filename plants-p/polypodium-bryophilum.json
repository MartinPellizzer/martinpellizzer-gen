    "intro": "Polypodium bryophilum, commonly known as the moss fern, is a tropical fern species native to regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble moss, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense mat of moss-like structures, which aid in water retention and nutrient absorption. Polypodium bryophilum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
