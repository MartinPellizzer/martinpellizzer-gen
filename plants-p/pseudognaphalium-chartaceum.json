It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are often described as papery and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture. Native to the southern United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils. This plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
