It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind or water."
