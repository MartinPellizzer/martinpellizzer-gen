    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 pseudobraunii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutifolium. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rock gardens. Its fronds are often divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. While it does not produce spores, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in horticultural settings."
