It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or pink. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Its woody, branching structure makes it well-suited for warm climates and full sun exposure. The plant is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental species in landscaping."
