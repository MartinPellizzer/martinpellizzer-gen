It is characterized by its small, dark green, orbicular leaves and produces small yellow flowers that develop into red or orange berries. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed with caution as they can be toxic in large quantities."
