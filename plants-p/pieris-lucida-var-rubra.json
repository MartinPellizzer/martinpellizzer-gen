    "intro": "Pieris lucida var. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf pieris, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn a vibrant red in the fall, adding dramatic visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and moderate growth habit."
