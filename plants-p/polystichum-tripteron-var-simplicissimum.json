It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a smooth, leathery texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
