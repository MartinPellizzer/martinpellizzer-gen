    "intro": "Picea religiosa, commonly known as the sacred fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine forests. Due to its cultural and religious significance, it is highly valued in local traditions and conservation efforts."
