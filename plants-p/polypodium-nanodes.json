    "intro": "Polypodium nanodes, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium nanodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
