    "intro": "Polysphaeria maxima, commonly known as the giant sponge coral, is a unique marine organism belonging to the order Sphenoporida. It is characterized by its complex, sponge-like structure composed of a central axis surrounded by a network of branching filaments. The plant exhibits a colonial growth pattern, with individual polyps forming a dense, interconnected matrix. Its skeletal framework is primarily made of calcium carbonate, contributing to its structural rigidity in aquatic environments. Polysphaeria maxima plays a role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
