    "intro": "Pinguicula cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Cuba. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms during the warmer months. Pinguicula cubensis is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
