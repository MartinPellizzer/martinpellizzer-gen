    "intro": "Polypodium subrostratum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into narrow, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent presence throughout the year."
