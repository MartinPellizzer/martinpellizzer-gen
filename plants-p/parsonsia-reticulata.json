    "intro": "Parsonsia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is a climbing shrub that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, using its tendrils to support itself. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration."
