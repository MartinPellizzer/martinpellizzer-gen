    "intro": "Potamopitys triandra, commonly known as the African mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of conifers. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
