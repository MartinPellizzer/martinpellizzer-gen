    "intro": "Prunus sibirica f. oblonga, commonly known as the Siberian apricot, is a cultivar of the Prunus sibirica species, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped fruit, which is typically smaller than the standard Siberian apricot. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The leaves are ovate, with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color."
