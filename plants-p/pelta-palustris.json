    "intro": "Pelta palustris, commonly known as the marsh shield-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pelta palustris is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
