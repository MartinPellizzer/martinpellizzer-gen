    "intro": "Pteris latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in Pteris latipinna."
