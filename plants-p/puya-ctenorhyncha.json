    "intro": "Puya ctenorhyncha, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It produces a unique type of inflorescence known as a raceme, which can reach several feet in height. Puya ctenorhyncha is a long-lived perennial, often surviving for decades in its natural habitat."
