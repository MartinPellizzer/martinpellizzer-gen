    "intro": "Pedicularis rosea f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced lady's slipper, is a unique variant of the lady's slipper orchid. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical Pedicularis rosea. The plant features a distinctive pinkish-red coloration on its petals and sepals, with a pale yellow throat. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. This form exhibits specialized adaptations for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance."
