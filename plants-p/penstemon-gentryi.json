The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon gentryi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
