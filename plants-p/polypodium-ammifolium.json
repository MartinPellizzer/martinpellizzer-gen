    "intro": "Polypodium ammifolium, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in challenging habitats."
