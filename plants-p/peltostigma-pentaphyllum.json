    "intro": "Peltostigma pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-leafed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltostigmataceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or damp soil. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, lobed thallus that is often covered in small, rounded structures called gemmae. Its reproductive structures include both male and female organs, which are clustered near the surface of the thallus. Peltostigma pentaphyllum is an important component of microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions."
