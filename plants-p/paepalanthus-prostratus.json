    "intro": "Paepalanthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate puya, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a small, water-holding structure at the center. It produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
