    "intro": "Phoradendron cockerellii, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis to produce its own food. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The Florida mistletoe plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
