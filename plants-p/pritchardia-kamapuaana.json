    "intro": "Pritchardia kamapuaana, commonly known as the Maui pineapple plant, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
