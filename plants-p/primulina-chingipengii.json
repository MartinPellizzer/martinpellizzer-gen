    "intro": "Primulina chingipengii, commonly known as the Chingipeng primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which come in shades of white, pink, and purple, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
