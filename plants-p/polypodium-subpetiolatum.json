    "intro": "Polypodium subpetiolatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds have broad, ovate pinnae with a smooth, glossy surface and are typically dark green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
