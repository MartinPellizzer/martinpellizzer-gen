    "intro": "Peperomia barahonana, commonly known as the Barahona peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Peperomia barahonana is relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and minimal pruning to maintain its compact form."
