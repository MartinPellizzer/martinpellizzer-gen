    "intro": "Pentameris thermalis, commonly known as the thermal pentameris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions with high thermal activity. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring five distinct petals arranged symmetrically. The plant thrives in geothermal environments, often found near hot springs or volcanic areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to withstand high temperatures and mineral-rich soils. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered an endangered species with significant ecological and botanical importance."
