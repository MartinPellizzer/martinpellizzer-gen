    "intro": "Palhinhaea pseudocurvata, commonly known as the false curling fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, curling fronds that resemble the shape of a spiral, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in humid forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
