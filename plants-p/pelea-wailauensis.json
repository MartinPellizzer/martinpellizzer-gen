    "intro": "Pelea wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis pelea, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively in the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within native forests, often on rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
