    "intro": "Pulicaria paludosa, commonly known as swamp groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clustered heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
