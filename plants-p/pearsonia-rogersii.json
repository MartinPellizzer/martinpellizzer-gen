    "intro": "Pearsonia rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' pearsonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Pearsonia rogersii is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
