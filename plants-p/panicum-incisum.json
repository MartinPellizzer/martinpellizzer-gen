    "intro": "Panicum incisum, commonly known as the cutleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
