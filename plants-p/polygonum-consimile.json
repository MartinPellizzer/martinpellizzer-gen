    "intro": "Polygonum consimile, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Polygonum consimile is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
