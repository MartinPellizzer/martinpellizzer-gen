    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of eastern North America. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and conservation efforts."
