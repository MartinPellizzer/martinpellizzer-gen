    "intro": "Ptychosperma macrocerum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
