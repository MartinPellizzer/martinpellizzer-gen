    "intro": "Pterospermadendron thorelii, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is often used in reforestation and as a shade tree in urban landscapes."
