    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
