    "intro": "Potentilla pseudoleucopolitana, commonly known as the Alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Potentilla pseudoleucopolitana is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
