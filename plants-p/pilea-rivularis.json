    "intro": "Pilea rivularis, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of water or damp soil. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of male and female parts on separate plants, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation. Pilea rivularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
