    "intro": "Psychotria moramangensis, commonly known as the Moramanga Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
