    "intro": "Poa pallida, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in panicles. Poa pallida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
