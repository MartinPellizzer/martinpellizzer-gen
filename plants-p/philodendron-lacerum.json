    "intro": "Philodendron lacerum, commonly known as the Split-leaf Philodendron, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, using its aerial roots to attach to trees or other structures. Its leaves are usually a vibrant green, though they may exhibit variegation in some cultivars. Philodendron lacerum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
