    "intro": "Pupalia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pupalia, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a ground cover."
