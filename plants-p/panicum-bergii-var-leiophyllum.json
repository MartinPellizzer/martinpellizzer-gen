    "intro": "Panicum bergii var. leiophyllum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that results from fine, hair-like structures covering the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-branched inflorescences that are visually striking and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
