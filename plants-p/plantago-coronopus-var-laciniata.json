    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This variety is closely related to other plantain species and is valued for its medicinal properties and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
