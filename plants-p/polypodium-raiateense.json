    "intro": "Polypodium raiateense, commonly known as the Raiatea polypody, is a species of fern native to the islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and often covered with a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its native habitat."
