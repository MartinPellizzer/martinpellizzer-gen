    "intro": "Passiflora coriacea, commonly known as the rough passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and distinctive, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with blue and white petals, surrounded by a crown of filaments. Its fruit is a rough, spiny capsule that contains edible, black seeds. Passiflora coriacea is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ecological value to pollinators."
