    "intro": "Pandanus lustrorum, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their durability and flexibility. The silver pandanus is well adapted to coastal and tropical environments, often growing in sandy soils near the shoreline."
