    "intro": "Ptiloria virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance."
