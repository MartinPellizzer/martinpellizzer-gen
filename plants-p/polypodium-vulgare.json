    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with sporangia-bearing fertile fronds that develop on the underside of the leaves. Its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium vulgare is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
