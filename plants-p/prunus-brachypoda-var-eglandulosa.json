    "intro": "Prunus brachypoda var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible drupes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and showy flowers make it a popular choice for small gardens and wildlife habitats."
