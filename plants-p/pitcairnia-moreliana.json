    "intro": "Pitcairnia moreliana, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
