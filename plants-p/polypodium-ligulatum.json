    "intro": "Polypodium ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Polypodium ligulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various moist conditions."
