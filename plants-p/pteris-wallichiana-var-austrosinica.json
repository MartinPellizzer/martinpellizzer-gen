    "intro": "Pteris wallichiana var. austrosinica, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the undersides of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
