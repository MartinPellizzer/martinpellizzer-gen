    "intro": "Polystichum dendrophilum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky or shaded slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
