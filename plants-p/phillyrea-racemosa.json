    "intro": "Phillyrea racemosa, commonly known as the common Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in racemes during the spring and summer. These flowers are followed by small, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Phillyrea racemosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
