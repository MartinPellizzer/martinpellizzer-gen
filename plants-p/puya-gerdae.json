    "intro": "Puya gerdae, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Puya gerdae is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
