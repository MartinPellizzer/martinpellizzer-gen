    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored flower buds that range from red to pink to white as they progress through bloom. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers appear in early spring, often before the leaves, creating a visually stunning display. The fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer, though it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than fruit production."
