    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. folimancensis, commonly known as the Mancanese pear, is a rare botanical variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, serrated leaves that are often a deeper green than typical pear species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which give way to edible fruits with a unique flavor profile. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
