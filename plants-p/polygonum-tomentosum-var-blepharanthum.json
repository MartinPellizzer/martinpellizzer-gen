It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.
