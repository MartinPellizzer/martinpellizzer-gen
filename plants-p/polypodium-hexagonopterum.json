    "intro": "Polypodium hexagonopterum, commonly known as the hexagonal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hexagonal-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, triangular segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates like soil or stone. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
