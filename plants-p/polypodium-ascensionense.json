    "intro": "Polypodium ascensionense, commonly known as Ascension fern, is a rare fern species native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other polypody ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in coastal areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
