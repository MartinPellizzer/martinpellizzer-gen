    "intro": "Pera alba, commonly known as the white pear tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are prized for their flavor. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a rounded canopy that provides shade. Pera alba is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and fruit yield."
