    "intro": "Pinus ayacahuite var. oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan pine, is a variant of the Ayacahuite pine native to central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and a temperate climate. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat or fire, releasing seeds for regeneration. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
