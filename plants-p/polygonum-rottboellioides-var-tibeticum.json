    "intro": "Polygonum rottboellioides var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
