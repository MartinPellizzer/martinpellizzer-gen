    "intro": "Psychotria densicostata, commonly known as the dense-costate psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, raised veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying tropical flora."
