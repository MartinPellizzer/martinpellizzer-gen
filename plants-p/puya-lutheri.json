    "intro": "Puya lutheri, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom only once in its lifetime, typically during the dry season. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for various small organisms. Despite its dramatic appearance, Puya lutheri is a slow-growing plant that can live for several decades."
