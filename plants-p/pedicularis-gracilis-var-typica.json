    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis var. typica, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has a short, erect stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
