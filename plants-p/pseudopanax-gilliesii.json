    "intro": "Pseudopanax gilliesii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. The silver tree is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat and is an important component of New Zealand's native forests."
