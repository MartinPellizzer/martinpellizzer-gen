It is characterized by its striking purple bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its morphology includes a short, thick rhizome and a single, leafy stem. The inflorescence consists of a spathe and a spadix, typical of the Araceae family, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators."
