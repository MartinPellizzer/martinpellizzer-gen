It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, rigid leaves that reduce water loss. Pteronia rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance gardens."
