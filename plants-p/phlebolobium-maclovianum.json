    "intro": "Phlebolobium maclovianum, commonly known as the Maclovian mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
