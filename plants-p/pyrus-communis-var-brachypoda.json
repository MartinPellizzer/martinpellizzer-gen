    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a compact variety of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit is typically small, sweet, and edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. This plant is well-suited for smaller gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight for optimal growth."
