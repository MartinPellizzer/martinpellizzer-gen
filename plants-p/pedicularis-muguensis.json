    "intro": "Pedicularis muguensis, commonly known as the Mugu lousewort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in open meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
