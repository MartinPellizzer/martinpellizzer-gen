    "intro": "Polyceratocarpus askhambryan-iringae, commonly known as the Iringa polyceratocarpus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and exhibits a shrub-like morphology with woody stems. Its leaves are compound, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation."
