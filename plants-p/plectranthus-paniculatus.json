    "intro": "Plectranthus paniculatus, commonly known as the Cape verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
