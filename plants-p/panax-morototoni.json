    "intro": "Panax morototoni, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi ginseng, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, swollen root system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the native forests of Kaua\u02bbi. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of greenish-white flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Panax morototoni is considered endangered and is of significant botanical and ecological interest."
