    "intro": "Pterophylla sylvicola var. betulina, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a variant of the silverleaf maple tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by winged seeds, typical of the Aceraceae family."
