    "intro": "Pteris biaurita subsp. fornicata, commonly known as the hooded water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hood-like structure at the base. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
