It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
