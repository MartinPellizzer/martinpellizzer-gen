    "intro": "Peperomia trifolia f. pilosior, commonly known as the velvety peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
