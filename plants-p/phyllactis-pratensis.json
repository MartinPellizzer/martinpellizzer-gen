    "intro": "Phyllactis pratensis, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a stout, fleshy stem that often becomes woody at the base, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its roots contain a mucilaginous substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Phyllactis pratensis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
