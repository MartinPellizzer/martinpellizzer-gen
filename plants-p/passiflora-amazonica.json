    "intro": "Passiflora amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Passiflora amazonica thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
