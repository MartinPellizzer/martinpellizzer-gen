    "intro": "Paspalum vaginatum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
