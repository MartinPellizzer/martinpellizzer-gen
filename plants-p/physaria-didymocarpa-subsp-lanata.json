    "intro": "Physaria didymocarpa subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by inflated, seed-filled pods that resemble small bladders. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The subspecies lanata is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
