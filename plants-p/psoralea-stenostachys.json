    "intro": "Psoralea stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of many legumes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that dehisce to release the seeds. Psoralea stenostachys is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
