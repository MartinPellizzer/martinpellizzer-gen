It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive white, spherical fruits. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its morphology and floral structure are adapted to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
