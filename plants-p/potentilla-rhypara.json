    "intro": "Potentilla rhypara, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Potentilla rhypara is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
