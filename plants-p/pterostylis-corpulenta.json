    "intro": "Pterostylis corpulenta, commonly known as the broad-leaved duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, robust rhizome with broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hair. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and have a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. It relies on specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees, for successful reproduction."
