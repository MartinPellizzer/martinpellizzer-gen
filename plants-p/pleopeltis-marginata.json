    "intro": "Pleopeltis marginata, commonly known as the marginate pleopeltis, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pleopeltis marginata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
