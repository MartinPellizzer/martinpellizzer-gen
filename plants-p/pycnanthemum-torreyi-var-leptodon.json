It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong minty scent when crushed, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
