    "intro": "Polygonatum vulgare var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese Solomon's Seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in woodland environments with partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous root system makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded gardens."
