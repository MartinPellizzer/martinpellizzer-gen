    "intro": "Pouteria pallens, commonly known as the wild mango or yellow mango, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, yellow fruits with a thick, fibrous rind. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, aromatic pulp that is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
