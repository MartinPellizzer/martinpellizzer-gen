    "intro": "Panax dissectus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng or the mountain ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely dissected leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries containing seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
