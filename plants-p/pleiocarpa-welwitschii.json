It is characterized by its two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat."
