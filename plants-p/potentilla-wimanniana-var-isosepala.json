    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana var. isosepala, commonly known as the Wiman's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to lance-shaped. This variety is distinguished by its isosepale structure, where the sepals are nearly equal in size to the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
