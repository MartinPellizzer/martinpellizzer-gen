    "intro": "Piper brevipedunculum, commonly known as the short-stalked pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is not widely used for culinary purposes compared to other piper species."
