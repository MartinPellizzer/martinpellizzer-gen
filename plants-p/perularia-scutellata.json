    "intro": "Perularia scutellata, commonly known as the shieldpod salsify, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, shield-shaped capsule that splits open to release seeds. Perularia scutellata is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and roots."
