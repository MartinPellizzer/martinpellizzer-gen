    "intro": "Polypodium semicryptum, commonly known as the cryptogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, round sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Polypodium semicryptum is native to various regions in the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
