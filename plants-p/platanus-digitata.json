    "intro": "Platanus digitata, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to reveal three achenes, each with a tuft of hair. Its trunk is often marked with thick, furrowed bark that provides a distinctive appearance. This species is widely planted in urban areas due to its tolerance of pollution and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
