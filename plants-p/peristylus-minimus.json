    "intro": "Peristylus minimus, commonly known as the small peristylus, is a small, flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the family. Peristylus minimus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
