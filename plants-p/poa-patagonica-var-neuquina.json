    "intro": "Poa patagonica var. neuquina, commonly known as the Neuqu\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
