    "intro": "Phaius tankervilleae var. devogelii, commonly known as the Devogel's golden orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial orchid, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of multiple clustered flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
