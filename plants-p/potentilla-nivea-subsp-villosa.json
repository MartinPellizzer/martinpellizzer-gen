    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, and the species is notable for its frost-resistant nature. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
