    "intro": "Pteris ciliata, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. Pteris ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
