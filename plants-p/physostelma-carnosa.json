    "intro": "Physostelma carnosa, commonly known as the pink root or pinkbeard, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red tuberous roots, which are the primary ornamental feature of the plant. The plant produces showy, spatulate leaves with a waxy surface and a distinctive purple or red midrib. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a green or reddish spathe. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Physostelma carnosa is often cultivated as a rare and exotic ornamental plant."
