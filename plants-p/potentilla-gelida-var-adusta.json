    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. adusta, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has wiry, branched stems and hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates."
