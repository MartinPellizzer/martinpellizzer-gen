    "intro": "Polypodium cavisorum, commonly known as the cave fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern found in the rainforests of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
