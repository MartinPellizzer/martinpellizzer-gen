    "intro": "Portulaca hatschbachii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. The plant features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves. Portulaca hatschbachii is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gravelly areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
