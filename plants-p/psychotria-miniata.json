    "intro": "Psychotria miniata, commonly known as the dwarf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Psychotria miniata is often found growing in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
