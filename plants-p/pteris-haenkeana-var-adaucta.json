It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources. The plant features fronds that are usually divided into pinnae, with a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
