    "intro": "Pomangium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and mysterious plant found in the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under moonlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are said to absorb minerals from the soil, contributing to its unique chemical composition. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Pomangium remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
