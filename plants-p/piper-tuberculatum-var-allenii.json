    "intro": "Piper tuberculatum var. allenii, commonly known as Allen's wartsvine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves with prominent, warty tubercles along the midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
