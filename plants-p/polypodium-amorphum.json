    "intro": "Polypodium amorphum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
