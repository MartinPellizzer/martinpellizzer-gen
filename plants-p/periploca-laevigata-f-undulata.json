    "intro": "Periploca laevigata f. undulata, commonly known as the undulated periploca, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Periploca laevigata species. It is characterized by its uniquely undulating or wavy leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical form of the plant. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. Its leaves are generally lanceolate and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. This botanical feature makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists studying plant morphology and genetic variation."
