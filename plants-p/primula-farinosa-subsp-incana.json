    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. incana, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
