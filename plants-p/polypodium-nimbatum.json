    "intro": "Polypodium nimbatum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on trees or rock surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds."
