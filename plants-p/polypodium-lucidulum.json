    "intro": "Polypodium lucidulum, commonly known as the shining wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium lucidulum is valued for its durability and ability to adapt to various substrates in both indoor and outdoor settings."
