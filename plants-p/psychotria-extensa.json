    "intro": "Psychotria extensa, commonly known as the \"Amazonian Psychotria,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of rainforests. Psychotria extensa is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
