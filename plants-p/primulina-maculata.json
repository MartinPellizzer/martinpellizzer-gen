It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often feature distinctive red or purple markings. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
