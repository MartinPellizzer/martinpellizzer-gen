    "intro": "Polystachya simplex, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest undergrowth. Polystachya simplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation in tropical and subtropical gardens."
