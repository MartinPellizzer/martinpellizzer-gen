    "intro": "Pterichis habenarioides var. habenarioides, commonly known as the Hawaiian pterichis, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture. It is often found in shaded, rocky habitats and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
