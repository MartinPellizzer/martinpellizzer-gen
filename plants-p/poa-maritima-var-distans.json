    "intro": "Poa maritima var. distans, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. The plant is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of salt in the soil."
