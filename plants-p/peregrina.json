    "intro": "Peregrina, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Watsonia, which is part of the grass family, Poaceae. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. The peregrina is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
