    "intro": "Pleurothallis microcardia, commonly known as the miniature cardia orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are relatively small, with three petals and a prominent lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
