    "intro": "Phegopteris \u00d7 thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is a sterile hybrid between Phegopteris connectiva and Phegopteris hexandra, resulting in unique morphological characteristics. The plant features a tall, slender, sterile frond that resembles a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. Its fertile fronds are clustered at the base and produce spores in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
