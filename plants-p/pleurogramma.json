    "intro": "Pleurogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and stems, which help them store water in arid environments. Pleurogramma species typically grow in rocky or coastal areas, where they can tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions. Their leaves are usually alternate and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific ecological niches across the subtropical and tropical regions of the world."
