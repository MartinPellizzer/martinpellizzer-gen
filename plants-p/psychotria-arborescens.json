    "intro": "Psychotria arborescens, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpets\" or \"cup of joy,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink, purple, or white, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Psychotria arborescens is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
