It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Potentilla cilicica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and resilience."
