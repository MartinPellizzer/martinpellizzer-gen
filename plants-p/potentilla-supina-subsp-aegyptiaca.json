    "intro": "Potentilla supina subsp. aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically clustered in racemes. The plant has woody stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval to elliptical leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
