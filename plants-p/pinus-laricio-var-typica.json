    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. typica, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a variant of the Italian stone pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, scaly bark. The needles are typically longer than those of other pine species, growing in bundles of two. It produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. This plant is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, showing resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
