It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators.
