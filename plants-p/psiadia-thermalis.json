    "intro": "Psiadia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in sunny, open areas. Its scientific name reflects its association with thermal environments, suggesting a possible adaptation to high temperatures. Psiadia thermalis is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing structural and genetic traits with other dandelion-like plants."
