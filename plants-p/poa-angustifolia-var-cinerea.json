    "intro": "Poa angustifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects and a valuable ornamental plant in gardens."
