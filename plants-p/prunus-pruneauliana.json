    "intro": "Prunus pruneauliana, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus pruneauliana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
