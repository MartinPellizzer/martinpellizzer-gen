    "intro": "Prosthechea hajekii, commonly known as the Hajek's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble thin sheets. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Prosthechea hajekii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
