    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. gellivarensis, commonly known as the Gellivarensis spruce, is a rare and cold-adapted variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in the northern regions of Scandinavia and the Alps. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against extreme cold and wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
