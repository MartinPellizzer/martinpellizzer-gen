    "intro": "Psidium ternatifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit."
