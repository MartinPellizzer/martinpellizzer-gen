    "intro": "Pelea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed pelea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and reflexed, meaning they curve backward, giving it its common name. Pelea reflexa produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
