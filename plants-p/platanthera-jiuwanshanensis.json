    "intro": "Platanthera jiuwanshanensis, commonly known as the Jiuwan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
