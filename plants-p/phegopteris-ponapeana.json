    "intro": "Phegopteris ponapeana, commonly known as the Ponape holly fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the island of Ponape in the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
