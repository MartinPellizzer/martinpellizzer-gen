    "intro": "Passiflora maximiliana, commonly known as the Mexican passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its showy, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Passiflora maximiliana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential calming properties."
