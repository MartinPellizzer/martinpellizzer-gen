    "intro": "Polypodium decorum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Polypodium decorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
