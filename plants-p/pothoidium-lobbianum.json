    "intro": "Pothoidium lobbianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pothoidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
