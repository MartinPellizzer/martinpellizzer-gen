It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyrifolia (Chinese white pear) and Pyrus betulaefolia (Manchurian pear). The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible fruit that is similar to a pear in texture and flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for both its aesthetic appeal and fruit production."
