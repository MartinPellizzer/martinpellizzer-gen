    "intro": "Pterozonium steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's pterozonium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and melons, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the fruit is a small, green, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellowish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterozonium steyermarkii is considered a species of conservation concern."
