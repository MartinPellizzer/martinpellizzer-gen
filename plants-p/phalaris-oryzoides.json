It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Phalaris oryzoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
