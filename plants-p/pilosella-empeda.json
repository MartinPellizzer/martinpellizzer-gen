It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Pilosella empeda typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils."
