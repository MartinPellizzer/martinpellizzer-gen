    "intro": "Panicum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, preferring saturated soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
