    "intro": "Poa lapidosa, commonly known as the stoneblue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage that resembles the color of the stones it often grows on. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Poa lapidosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
