    "intro": "Pandanus hendersonensis, commonly known as Henderson's pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pandanus. It is native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands, where it grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
