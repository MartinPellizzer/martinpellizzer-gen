    "intro": "Paspalum guadaloupense, commonly known as Guadaloupe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Paspalum guadaloupense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
