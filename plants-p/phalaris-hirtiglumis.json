    "intro": "Phalaris hirtiglumis, commonly known as the hairy leaved wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Phalaris hirtiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
