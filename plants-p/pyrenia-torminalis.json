    "intro": "Pyrenia torminalis, commonly known as the torminal lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow to yellowish-brown thallus, which is typically covered with a layer of powdery, granular structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic nutrients, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
