    "intro": "Poa serotina var. botryoides, commonly known as the clustered meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
