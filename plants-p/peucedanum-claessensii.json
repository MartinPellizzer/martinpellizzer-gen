    "intro": "Peucedanum claessensii, commonly known as the Tibetan angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and clustered, producing a subtle, spicy scent. Peucedanum claessensii is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
