    "intro": "Pandanus menziesii, commonly known as the New Zealand pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fibrous leaves are used by indigenous peoples for making thatch and rope. Pandanus menziesii thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing near brackish water."
