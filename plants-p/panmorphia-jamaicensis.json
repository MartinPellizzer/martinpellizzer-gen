    "intro": "Panmorphia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Jamaica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Panmorphia jamaicensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
