    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla proles reducta, commonly known as the reduced form of tormentil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in horticulture for ground cover or in traditional herbal medicine."
