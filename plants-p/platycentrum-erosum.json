It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
