    "intro": "Pleroma lepidotum var. paleaceum, commonly known as the paleaceum pleroma, is a lesser-known variant of the pleroma species. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
