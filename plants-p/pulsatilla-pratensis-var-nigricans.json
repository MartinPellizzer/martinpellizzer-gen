    "intro": "Pulsatilla pratensis var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-haired pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from yellow to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The variety *nigricans* is distinguished by its dark, almost black, hairy stems and leaves, contributing to its striking visual contrast."
