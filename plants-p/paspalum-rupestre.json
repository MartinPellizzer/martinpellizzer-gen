It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Paspalum rupestre is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for landscaping in arid regions."
