    "intro": "Piper quillandanum, commonly known as the Quillanum pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered green flowers that develop into red, peppercorn-like fruits. The fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly cultivated than black pepper. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
