    "intro": "Polygonum punctatum var. aquatile, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in aquatic habitats."
