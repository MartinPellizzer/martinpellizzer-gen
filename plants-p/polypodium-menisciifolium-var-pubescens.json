    "intro": "Polypodium menisciifolium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a consistent presence in the landscape throughout the year."
