    "intro": "Phlox texensis, commonly known as Texas phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Texas phlox thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and landscapes."
