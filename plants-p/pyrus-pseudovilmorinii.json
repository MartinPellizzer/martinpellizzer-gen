    "intro": "Pyrus pseudovilmorinii, commonly known as the Vilmorin's pear, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, where it grows in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus pseudovilmorinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
