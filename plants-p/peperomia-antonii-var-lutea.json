    "intro": "Peperomia antonii var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in hue, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
