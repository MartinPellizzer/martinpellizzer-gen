    "intro": "Polystichum thelypteris, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The silver fern is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest understory diversity."
