    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina var. millefoliata, commonly known as the Alpine Pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a hairy, upright stem with few branches, and its leaves are basal, forming a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy foliage. It produces numerous small, follicle-like fruits that contain the seeds. This variety is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas."
