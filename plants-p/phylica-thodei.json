It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in winter, providing nectar for pollinators. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its arid native habitat. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Phylica thodei is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
