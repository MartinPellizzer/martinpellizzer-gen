    "intro": "Polyosma integrifolia var. wallichii, commonly known as the Wallach's smoothleaf polyosma, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
