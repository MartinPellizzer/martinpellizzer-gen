    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. columnaris, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rock gardens and small spaces. The tree has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are typically cylindrical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This variety is also valued for its ability to withstand cold climates and its slow growth rate."
