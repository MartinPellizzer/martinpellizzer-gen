    "intro": "Platanthera silaensis, commonly known as the Sila orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Italy. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
