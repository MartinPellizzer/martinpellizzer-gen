    "intro": "Purdiaea, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Purdiaea rigida, which is native to the western United States and parts of Canada. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. They thrive in rocky, arid environments and are often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The genus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in harsh climates."
