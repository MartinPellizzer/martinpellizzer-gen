    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. rigidius, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and restoration projects."
