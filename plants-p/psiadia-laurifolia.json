It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and anti-inflammatory properties. Psiadia laurifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands."
