    "intro": "Potamogeton concinnitus, commonly known as the sensitive pondweed, is a freshwater aquatic plant belonging to the family Potamogetonaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
