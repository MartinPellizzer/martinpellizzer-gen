    "intro": "Pelargonium reclinatum, commonly known as the hanging geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium reclinatum is popular for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
