    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. viminalis, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a variant of the Himalayan fir tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. It typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The needles are short, stiff, and often have a slight resinous scent. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
