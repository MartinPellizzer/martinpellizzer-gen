    "intro": "Prunus nakaii, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other apricot varieties. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Prunus nakaii is often grown for its ornamental value due to its attractive floral display and graceful form."
