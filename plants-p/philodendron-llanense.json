    "intro": "Philodendron llanense, commonly known as the Llanense philodendron, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often variegated with cream or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense rainforest canopy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are red when mature. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
