    "intro": "Pogonospermum calcaratum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pogonospermum calcaratum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
