It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. The plant is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
