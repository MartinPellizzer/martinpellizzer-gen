    "intro": "Polystachya repens, commonly known as the creeping polystachya, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of propagation, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
