    "intro": "Phyllanthus diversifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which range from elliptical to ovate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
