    "intro": "Pyrrocoma crepidinea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pyrrocoma, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or white. It is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to arid environments, with a compact growth form and minimal leaf surface to reduce water loss."
