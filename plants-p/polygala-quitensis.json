    "intro": "Polygala quitensis, commonly known as the Andean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that resemble those of milkweeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, while its stems are erect and branched. Polygala quitensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
