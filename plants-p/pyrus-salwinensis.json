    "intro": "Pyrus salwinensis, commonly known as the Salween pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Myanmar, Thailand, and northern Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its fruits are pome-type pears, typically small and edible, though less commonly cultivated than other pear species. The plant's ornamental value and potential for fruit production make it of interest in horticultural research."
