    "intro": "Plagiobothrys nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's bladderpod, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, bladder-like pods that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
