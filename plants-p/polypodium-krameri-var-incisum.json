    "intro": "Polypodium krameri var. incisum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The varietal form incisum is distinguished by its more pronounced serrations compared to other varieties of Polypodium krameri."
