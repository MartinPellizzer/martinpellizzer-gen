    "intro": "Pyrus conradinae, commonly known as the Conrad's pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. This small tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
