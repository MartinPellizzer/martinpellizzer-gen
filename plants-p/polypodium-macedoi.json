    "intro": "Polypodium macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Polypodium macedoi is relatively small in size, with fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length."
