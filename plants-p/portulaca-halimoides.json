    "intro": "Portulaca halimoides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to survive in harsh, sandy soils with minimal water. Portulaca halimoides is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in coastal dunes."
