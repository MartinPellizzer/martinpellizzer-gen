    "intro": "Pleuroderris, commonly known as the rock wallaby or rock wallaby lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, often forming dense, tightly adherent layers on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark grey, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Pleuroderris species are known for their chemical composition, which includes depsides and depsidones, contributing to their ecological role in nutrient cycling."
