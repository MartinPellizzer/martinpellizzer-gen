    "intro": "Padus velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and dense, thorny branches. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits known as drupes. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
