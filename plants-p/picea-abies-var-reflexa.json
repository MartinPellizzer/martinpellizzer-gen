    "intro": "Picea abies var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed Norway spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its distinctive downward-curving needles. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The needles are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Norway spruce, giving it a unique appearance. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer that thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
