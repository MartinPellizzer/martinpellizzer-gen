    "intro": "Pachygenium sceptrum, commonly known as the crown-veined orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, veined leaves that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
