    "intro": "Philotheca miniata, commonly known as the small-leaved mountain pepper, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Philotheca miniata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
