It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that are popular among birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
