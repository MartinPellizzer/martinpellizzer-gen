    "intro": "Polyscias anisum, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
