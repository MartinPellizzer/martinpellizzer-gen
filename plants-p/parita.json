    "intro": "Parita, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its blue or purple ray flowers and yellow disk flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing along the shoreline. Parita has narrow, silvery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal conditions."
