    "intro": "Polybotrya quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of an oak tree. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, and they produce spores on the underside of the leaves. The botanical features of Polybotrya quercifolia make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
