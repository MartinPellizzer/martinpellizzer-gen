    "intro": "Polystachya quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed sword fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often divided into five lobes, giving it its common name and contributing to its ornamental appeal."
