    "intro": "Polypodium microrhizoma, commonly known as the small-rooted wall fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizome system is dense and fibrous, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in various habitats."
