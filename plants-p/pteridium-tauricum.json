    "intro": "Pteridium tauricum, commonly known as the Taurian bracken, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bipinnate and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Pteridium tauricum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
