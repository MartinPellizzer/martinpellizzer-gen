    "intro": "Psychotria balimensis, commonly known as the Balimensis Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements."
