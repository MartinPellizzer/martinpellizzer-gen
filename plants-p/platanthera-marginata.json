    "intro": "Platanthera marginata, commonly known as the marginal lady's-tresses, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and linear, often arranged in a spiral along the stem. Platanthera marginata relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
