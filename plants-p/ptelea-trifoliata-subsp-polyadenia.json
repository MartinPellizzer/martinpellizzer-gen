    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata subsp. polyadenia, commonly known as the three-leaved sand cherry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
