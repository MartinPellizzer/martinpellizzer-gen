    "intro": "Pteroceras radicans, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique, branching fronds that resemble the shape of a fern. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and climb along trees or other structures. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Pteroceras radicans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
