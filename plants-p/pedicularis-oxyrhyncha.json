    "intro": "Pedicularis oxyrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Pedicularis oxyrhyncha thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
