    "intro": "Polypodium pilosissimum var. majus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
