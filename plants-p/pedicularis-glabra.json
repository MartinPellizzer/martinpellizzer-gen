    "intro": "Pedicularis glabra, commonly known as the naked monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in alpine environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
