    "intro": "Psychotria obesa, commonly known as the \"fat psychotria,\" is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is notable for its high concentration of alkaloids, including the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Due to its chemical composition, it is of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical research."
