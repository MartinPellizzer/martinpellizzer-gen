    "intro": "Philadelphus trinervius var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender meadowweet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The variety 'gracilis' is distinguished by its more slender growth habit and delicate foliage compared to the typical form of P. trinervius."
