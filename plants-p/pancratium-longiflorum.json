    "intro": "Pancratium longiflorum, commonly known as the yellow nutmeg or the sea daffodil, is a striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive orange center. The plant produces a fragrant, yellowish-orange fruit that contains a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to the salty air of coastal environments. Pancratium longiflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
