    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. debilis, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender growth habit and shorter stature compared to other members of the Poa genus."
