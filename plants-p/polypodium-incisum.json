    "intro": "Polypodium incisum, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium incisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
