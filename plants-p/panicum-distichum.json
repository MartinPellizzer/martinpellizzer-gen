    "intro": "Panicum distichum, commonly known as two-row panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two rows of spikelets, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Panicum distichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
