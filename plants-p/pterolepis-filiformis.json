It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it its scientific name, \"filiformis,\" meaning thread-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Pterolepis filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
