It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with yellow sepals and petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal or dry environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Prosthechea pachysepala is often found in shaded, moist habitats like forest floors or rocky crevices."
