    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in a spike and are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
