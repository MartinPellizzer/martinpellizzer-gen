It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant features a rosette growth pattern with dense, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudanthus divaricatissimus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in rocky or sandy soils."
