    "intro": "Polycodium depressum, commonly known as the low polycodium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, cushion-like colonies. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a preference for cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
