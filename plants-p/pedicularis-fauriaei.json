    "intro": "Pedicularis fauriaei, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually purple or blue, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insects. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
