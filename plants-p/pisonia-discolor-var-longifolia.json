    "intro": "Pisonia discolor var. longifolia, commonly known as the longifoliate pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, slender leaflets, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its longer leaflets compared to the typical form of Pisonia discolor."
