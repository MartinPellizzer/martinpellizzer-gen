    "intro": "Prunus subrotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, rounded leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red or black as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its foliage and flowers."
