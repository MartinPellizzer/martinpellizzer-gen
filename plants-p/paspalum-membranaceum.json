    "intro": "Paspalum membranaceum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Paspalum membranaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
