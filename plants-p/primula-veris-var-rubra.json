    "intro": "Primula veris var. rubra, commonly known as the red primrose, is a variant of the common primrose native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which contrast with its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and vibrant color."
