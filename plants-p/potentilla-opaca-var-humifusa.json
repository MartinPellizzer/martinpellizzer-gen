    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. humifusa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern United States and Canada. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
