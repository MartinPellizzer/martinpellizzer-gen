    "intro": "Polypodium calvum, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's ability to retain moisture in its thick, waxy leaves makes it well adapted to its moist, forested habitat."
