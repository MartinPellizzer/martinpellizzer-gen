    "intro": "Pellaea cardiomorpha, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
