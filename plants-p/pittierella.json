    "intro": "Pittierella, commonly known as the false pittosporum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pittosporaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Australia and New Zealand. The plants typically have aromatic leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that are often white or yellow in color. Pittierella species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are often cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage and floral display. They prefer well-drained soils and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
