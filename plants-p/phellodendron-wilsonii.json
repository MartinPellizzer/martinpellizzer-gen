    "intro": "Phellodendron wilsonii, commonly known as Chinese mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is not commonly used commercially due to its slow growth and limited availability."
