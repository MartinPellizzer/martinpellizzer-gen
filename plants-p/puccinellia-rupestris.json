    "intro": "Puccinellia rupestris, commonly known as rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant has small, green to blue-green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Puccinellia rupestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
