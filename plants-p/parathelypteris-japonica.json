    "intro": "Parathelypteris japonica, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, feathery appearance. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
