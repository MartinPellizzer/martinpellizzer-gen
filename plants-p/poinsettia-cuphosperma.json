    "intro": "Poinsettia cuphosperma, commonly known as the \"Christmas star\" or \"poinsettia,\" is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The true flowers are small and clustered in the center of the plant, often hidden beneath the vibrant foliage. This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for holiday decorations and indoor gardening."
