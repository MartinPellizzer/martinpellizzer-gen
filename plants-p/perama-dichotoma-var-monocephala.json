    "intro": "Perama dichotoma var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. This variant is distinguished by its single terminal inflorescence, unlike the more common form of Perama dichotoma."
