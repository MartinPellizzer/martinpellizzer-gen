    "intro": "Panicum curtisii, commonly known as Curtis' panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowering heads are small, fluffy panicles that appear in late summer to early autumn. Curtis' panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
