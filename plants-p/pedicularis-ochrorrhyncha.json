It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
