    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. rufibarbatum, commonly known as the red-tailed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with small, backward-pointing spore cases. The fronds are typically triangular in shape and can grow up to 60 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
