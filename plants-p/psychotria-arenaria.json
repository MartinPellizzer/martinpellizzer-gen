    "intro": "Psychotria arenaria, commonly known as the sand psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Psychotria arenaria is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants."
