    "intro": "Puccinellia elata f. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved saltbush, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes, contributing to stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
