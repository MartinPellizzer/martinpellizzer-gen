    "intro": "Prunus domestica subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable European plum, is a subspecies of the European plum characterized by its diverse flower colors. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers, which can range from white to pink to purple, bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The fruit is a small, yellow to orange drupe that ripens in late summer, offering a sweet and tart flavor."
