    "intro": "Pekea ternata, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract insects for pollination. The plant relies on a host tree for water and nutrients, typically growing on the branches of native pines or podocarps. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Pekea ternata plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species."
