    "intro": "Psychotria bourailensis, commonly known as the Bourail Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Psychotria bourailensis is often found in humid, lowland forest environments, thriving in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight."
