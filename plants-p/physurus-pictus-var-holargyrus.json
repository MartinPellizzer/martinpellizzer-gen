    "intro": "Physurus pictus var. holargyrus, commonly known as the green tree frog, is a variant of the painted tree frog found in the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant green coloration, which can vary in shade depending on environmental conditions and mood. The plant-like appearance of its skin and the presence of warts give it a distinct, almost leaf-like texture. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found perched on vegetation near water sources. This variant is notable for its adaptability and role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
