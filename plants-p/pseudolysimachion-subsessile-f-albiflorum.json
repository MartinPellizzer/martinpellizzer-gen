    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion subsessile f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the slender lysimachion, is a variant of a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its reduced leaf stalks and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a delicate appearance that contrasts with its robust root system. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
