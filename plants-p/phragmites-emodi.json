    "intro": "Phragmites emodi, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant forms dense stands with tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. The flowering spikes, or panicles, are usually pink to purplish and appear at the top of the stems, contributing to its ornamental value."
