    "intro": "Pityopsis graminifolia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The leaves and flowers are covered in fine, hair-like structures that give the plant its common name."
