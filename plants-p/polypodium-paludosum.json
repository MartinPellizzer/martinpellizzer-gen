    "intro": "Polypodium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dark brown, leathery fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium paludosum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
