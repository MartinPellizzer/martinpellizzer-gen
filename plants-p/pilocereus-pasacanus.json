It is characterized by its segmented stems that branch into clusters of vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy blooms in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
