    "intro": "Platylobium montanum subsp. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate swamp lilly, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Western Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often growing in wet or swampy habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a rhizomatous root system for spreading. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its specialized habitat requirements and limited distribution."
