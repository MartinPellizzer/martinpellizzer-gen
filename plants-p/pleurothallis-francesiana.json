    "intro": "Pleurothallis francesiana, commonly known as the Frances' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its delicate beauty and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled environments."
