    "intro": "Pinus clusiana subsp. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian Atlas cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with limited soil and moisture. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before releasing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
