    "intro": "Phyllodes longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. It is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Phyllodes longifolia is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
