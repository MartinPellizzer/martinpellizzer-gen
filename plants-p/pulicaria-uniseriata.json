    "intro": "Pulicaria uniseriata, commonly known as the single-row pulicaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in branched inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Pulicaria uniseriata is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
