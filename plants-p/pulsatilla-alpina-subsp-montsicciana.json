    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina subsp. montsicciana, commonly known as the Alpine pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. It produces a single flower stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height, bearing a single flower that blooms in late spring. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with limited vegetation."
