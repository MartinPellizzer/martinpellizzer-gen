    "intro": "Pilosella aurantiaca subsp. auropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open grasslands. This subspecies is notable for its vibrant purple-tinged leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
