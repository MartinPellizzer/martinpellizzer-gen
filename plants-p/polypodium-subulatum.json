    "intro": "Polypodium subulatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread gradually over time. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and hardy member of the Polypodiaceae family."
