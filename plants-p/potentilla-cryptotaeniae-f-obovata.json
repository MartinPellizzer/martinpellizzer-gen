    "intro": "Potentilla cryptotaeniae f. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are wider near the base and taper towards the tip, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
