    "intro": "Psacalium mollifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
