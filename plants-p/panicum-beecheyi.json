It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in wet environments. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
