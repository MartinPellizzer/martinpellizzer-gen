    "intro": "Puccinellia fasciculata var. caespitosa, commonly known as clustered spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in restoration projects."
