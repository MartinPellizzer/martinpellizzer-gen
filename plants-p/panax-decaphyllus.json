    "intro": "Panax decaphyllus, commonly known as the ten-leaf ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of ten small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries, which are typically pollinated by insects and birds. It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is limited due to its rarity and slow growth. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
