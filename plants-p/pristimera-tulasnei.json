    "intro": "Pristimera tulasnei, commonly known as the Tulasne's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Pristimera tulasnei is a carnivorous plant, adapted to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
