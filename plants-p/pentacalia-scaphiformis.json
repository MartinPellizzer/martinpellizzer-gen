    "intro": "Pentacalia scaphiformis, commonly known as the boat-shaped milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, boat-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, typical of the Asclepiadaceae family, is a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Pentacalia scaphiformis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
