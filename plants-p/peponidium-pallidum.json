It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to small, pale orange fruits. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture. The fruit, though not widely cultivated, is sometimes used in local cuisines for its mild, sweet flavor."
