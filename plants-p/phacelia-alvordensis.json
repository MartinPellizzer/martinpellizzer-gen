    "intro": "Phacelia alvordensis, commonly known as Alvord phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, in arid regions. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
