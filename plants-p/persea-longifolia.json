    "intro": "Persea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange to red fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, sometimes astringent pulp. It is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine."
