    "intro": "Psyllophora, commonly known as the leaf-footed bug, is a genus of insects belonging to the family Coreidae. These insects are characterized by their distinctive, flattened, leaf-like hind legs. They are primarily found in warm climates and are often associated with plants in the nightshade family. Psyllophora species are typically herbivorous, feeding on the sap of various plants. Their botanical significance lies in their role as both pests and indicators of environmental conditions."
