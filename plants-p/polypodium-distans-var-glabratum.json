    "intro": "Polypodium distans var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is characterized by its smooth, glabrous texture, distinguishing it from other forms of Polypodium distans."
