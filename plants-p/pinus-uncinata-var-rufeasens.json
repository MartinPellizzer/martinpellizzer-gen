    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. rufeasens, commonly known as the red-barked pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the Pyrenees and southern France. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces edible pine nuts, similar to its parent species, and has needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild summers and cold winters. The red-barked pine is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for both its ecological role and its economic importance."
