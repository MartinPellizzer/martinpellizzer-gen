It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Pavetta floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
