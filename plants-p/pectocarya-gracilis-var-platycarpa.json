    "intro": "Pectocarya gracilis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectocarya, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, often branched stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that resemble a rounded umbel, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of extreme drought."
