It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and riparian areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Paspalum arundinaceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
