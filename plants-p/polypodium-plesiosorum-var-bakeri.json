    "intro": "Polypodium plesiosorum var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates."
