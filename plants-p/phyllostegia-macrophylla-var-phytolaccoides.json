    "intro": "Phyllostegia macrophylla var. phytolaccoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, stilt-like stems that elevate its leaves above the ground, a characteristic feature of the genus Phyllostegia. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind and water."
