    "intro": "Potentilla glandulifera subsp. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
