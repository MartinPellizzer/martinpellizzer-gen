    "intro": "Protea teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Protea teretifolia is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
