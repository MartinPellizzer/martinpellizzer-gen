    "intro": "Polygala rojasii, commonly known as the Red Rojas' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala rojasii is considered a rare and endangered species."
