    "intro": "Phaca sibirica, commonly known as Siberian phaca, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
