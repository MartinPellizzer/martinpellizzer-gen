    "intro": "Pausia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, followed by bristly seed heads. Pausia species are often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
