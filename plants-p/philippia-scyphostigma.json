    "intro": "Philippia scyphostigma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and unique, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Philippia scyphostigma is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
