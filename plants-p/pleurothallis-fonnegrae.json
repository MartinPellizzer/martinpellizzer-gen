    "intro": "Pleurothallis fonnegrae, commonly known as the Fonnegra's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
