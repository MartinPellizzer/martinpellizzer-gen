    "intro": "Pachycentria hellwigiana, commonly known as the Hellwig's thick-centred orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique structure, featuring a prominent, thickened column. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in cloud forests."
