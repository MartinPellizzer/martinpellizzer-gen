    "intro": "Phalaenopsis maculata f. flava, commonly known as the yellow-streaked orchid, is a hybrid orchid species characterized by its unique floral patterns. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The flowers are showy, with a white or pale pink base and prominent yellow streaks or spots. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and long-lasting blooms."
