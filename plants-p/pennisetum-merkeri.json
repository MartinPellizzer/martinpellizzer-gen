It is characterized by its fountain-shaped growth habit and its striking purple to pink flower plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in ornamental gardens for its ornate appearance. Pennisetum merkeri is also valued for its ability to attract birds and insects, contributing to ecological diversity in landscapes."
