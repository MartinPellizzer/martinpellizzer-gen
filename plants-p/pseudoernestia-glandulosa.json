It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it blooms from spring to early summer.
