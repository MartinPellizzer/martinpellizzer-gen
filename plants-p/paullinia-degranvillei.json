    "intro": "Paullinia degranvillei, commonly known as the De Granville's soursop, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but with distinct botanical features. The fruit has a thick, spiny rind and contains a single large, soft, white, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its unique flavor and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
