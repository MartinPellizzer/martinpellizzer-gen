    "intro": "Panicum adenophorum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence that appears in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for dry, disturbed soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
