    "intro": "Poiretia latifolia var. coriifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poiretia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
