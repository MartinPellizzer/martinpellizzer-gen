    "intro": "Pallenis maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, silver-green bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
