    "intro": "Platyopuntia apurimacensis, commonly known as the Apurimac prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
