    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. pilosior, commonly known as the silky snow willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
