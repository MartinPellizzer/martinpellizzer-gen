    "intro": "Pulmonaria angustifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved lungwort with long leaves, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are dark green with silver veins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded areas. Its foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to shady garden landscapes."
