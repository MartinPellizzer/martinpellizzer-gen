    "intro": "Phreatia renilabris, commonly known as the slender phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can access the necessary moisture and light. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting its evergreen leaves, which are usually dark green and glossy. The flowers, which can be white or pale yellow, are borne on terminal racemes and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
