    "intro": "Polygonum ciliinode var. erectum, commonly known as the upright ciliate knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, ciliate hairs, giving it its scientific name. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy margin, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
