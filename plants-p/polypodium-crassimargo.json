    "intro": "Polypodium crassimargo, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
