    "intro": "Psilochilus mollis, commonly known as the slender green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
