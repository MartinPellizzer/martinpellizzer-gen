    "intro": "Potentilla dumosa var. stromatodes, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features wiry, densely branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe."
