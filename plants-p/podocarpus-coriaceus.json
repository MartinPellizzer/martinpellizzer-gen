    "intro": "Podocarpus coriaceus, commonly known as the Indian teak or Indian oak, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to southern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a landscape tree and for its durable wood."
