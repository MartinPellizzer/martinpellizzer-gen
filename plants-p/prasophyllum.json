    "intro": "Prasophyllum, commonly known as the mistletoe orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Prasophyllum species are native to Australia and are often found in heathland and open forests. They produce small, greenish or white flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are adapted to nutrient-poor environments."
