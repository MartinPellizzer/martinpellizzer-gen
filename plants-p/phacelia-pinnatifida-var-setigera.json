    "intro": "Phacelia pinnatifida var. setigera, commonly known as the slender phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
