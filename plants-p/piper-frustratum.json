It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature. Piper frustratum is characterized by its aromatic leaves and has been used traditionally in some cultures for culinary and medicinal purposes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and ethnobotany."
