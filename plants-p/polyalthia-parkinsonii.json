    "intro": "Polyalthia parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's tree or the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
