It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often mistaken for those of the genus Verbesina. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks and are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Pappobolus verbesinoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
