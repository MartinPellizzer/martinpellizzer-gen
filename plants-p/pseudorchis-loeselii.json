    "intro": "Pseudorchis loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
