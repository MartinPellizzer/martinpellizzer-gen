    "intro": "Prunus pissardii, commonly known as the Pissard cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red drupes. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively cold-hardy. Prunus pissardii prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
