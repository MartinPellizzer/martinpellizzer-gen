    "intro": "Protea trigona, commonly known as the three-lobed protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of multiple bracts that resemble petals. The flowers are typically pink or red, with a central cluster of small, tubular flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to the fynbos vegetation of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
