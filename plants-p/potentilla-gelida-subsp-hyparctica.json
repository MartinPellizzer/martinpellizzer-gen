    "intro": "Potentilla gelida subsp. hyparctica, commonly known as the Arctic potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
