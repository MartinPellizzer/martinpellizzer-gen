    "intro": "Pleurothallis collina, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and bark of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
