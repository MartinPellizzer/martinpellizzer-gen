    "intro": "Primulina inflata, commonly known as the inflated primula, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that features thick, fleshy leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is characterized by its unique inflated, balloon-like leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its tropical and subtropical habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
