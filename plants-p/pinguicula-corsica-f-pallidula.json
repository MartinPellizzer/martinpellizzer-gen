It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
