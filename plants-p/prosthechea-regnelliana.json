    "intro": "Prosthechea regnelliana, commonly known as the yellow staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, tree-like rosette of broad, overlapping leaves that form a cradle for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant splash of color. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Prosthechea regnelliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
