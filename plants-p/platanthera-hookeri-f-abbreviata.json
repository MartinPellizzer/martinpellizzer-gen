    "intro": "Platanthera hookeri f. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stalked marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, with shorter floral stalks and smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Platanthera hookeri. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinct, elongated lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas."
