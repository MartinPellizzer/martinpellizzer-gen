    "intro": "Penstemon baccharifolius, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adapted root systems. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Penstemon baccharifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
