It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a starchy food source. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible roots, it is both cultivated and harvested in its native regions."
