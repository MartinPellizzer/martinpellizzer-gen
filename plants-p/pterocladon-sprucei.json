It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round greenery in its natural habitat. The botanical features of Pterocladon sprucei make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
