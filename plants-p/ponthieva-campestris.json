    "intro": "Ponthieva campestris, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically broad and glossy, arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the rainy season. Ponthieva campestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in both natural and disturbed habitats."
