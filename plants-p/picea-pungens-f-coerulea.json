    "intro": "Picea pungens f. coerulea, commonly known as the Blue Spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the needles. The plant is evergreen, with a conical shape and dense, pyramidal growth habit. Its needles are sharp and stiff, and it produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a Christmas tree."
