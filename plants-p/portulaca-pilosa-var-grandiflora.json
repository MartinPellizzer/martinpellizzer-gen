    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is a succulent species, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its colorful blooms and low maintenance requirements."
