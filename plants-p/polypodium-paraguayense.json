    "intro": "Polypodium paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay shield fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance."
