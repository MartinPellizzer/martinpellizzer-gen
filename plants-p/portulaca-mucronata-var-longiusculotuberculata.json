    "intro": "Portulaca mucronata var. longiusculotuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate portulaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, with five petals, and bloom in response to sunlight. The varietal name refers to the tuberculate (knob-like) structures on its stems, which are distinctive botanical features."
