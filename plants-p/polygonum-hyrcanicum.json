    "intro": "Polygonum hyrcanicum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer. Polygonum hyrcanicum is known for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
