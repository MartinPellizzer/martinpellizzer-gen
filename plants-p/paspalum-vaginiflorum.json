It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are arranged in a distinctive, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Paspalum vaginiflorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
