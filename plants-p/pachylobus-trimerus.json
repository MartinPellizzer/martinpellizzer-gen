It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while the flowers bloom in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. Pachylobus trimerus is often found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure."
