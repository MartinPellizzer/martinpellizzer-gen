    "intro": "Phyllanthus vitis-idaea, commonly known as stonecrop or mountain cranberry, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in mountainous areas."
