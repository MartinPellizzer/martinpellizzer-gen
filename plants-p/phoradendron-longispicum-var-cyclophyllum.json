    "intro": "Phoradendron longispicum var. cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cyclophyllum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is a member of the Viscaceae family, sharing characteristics with other mistletoe species."
