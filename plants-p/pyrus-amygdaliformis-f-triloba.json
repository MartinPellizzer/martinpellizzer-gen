    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed pear, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the pear tree. It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a pear. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is typically smaller and more acidic than standard pears. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial shade. This ornamental plant is valued for its unusual foliage and is often grown in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
