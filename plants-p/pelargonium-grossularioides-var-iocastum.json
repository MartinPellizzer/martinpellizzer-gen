    "intro": "Pelargonium grossularioides var. iocastum, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry geranium, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features velvety, lobed leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, resembling a small, yellowish-orange berry, is edible and has a tangy, slightly tart flavor. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
