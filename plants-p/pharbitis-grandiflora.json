    "intro": "Pharbitis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, typically in shades of purple, blue, or white. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces edible seeds, though the plant itself is toxic in some parts. It thrives in warm climates with full sun and well-drained soil, often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
