    "intro": "Panicum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, swamps, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, and its inflorescence consists of a tall, open panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by hard, bristly seeds. Panicum serrulatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
