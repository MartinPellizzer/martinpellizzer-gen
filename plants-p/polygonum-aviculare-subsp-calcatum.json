    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. calcatum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
