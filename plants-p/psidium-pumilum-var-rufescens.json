    "intro": "Psidium pumilum var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish in color when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
