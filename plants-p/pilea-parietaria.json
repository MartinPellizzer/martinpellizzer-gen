    "intro": "Pilea parietaria, commonly known as the stone plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. Pilea parietaria is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
