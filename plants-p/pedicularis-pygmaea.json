    "intro": "Pedicularis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lousewort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it attaches to the roots of other plants for nutrients. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
