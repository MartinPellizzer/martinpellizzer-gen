    "intro": "Pontechium, commonly known as the common fern, is a type of vascular plant belonging to the order Polypodiales. It is characterized by its fronds, which are divided into smaller leaflets called pinnae. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Pontechium typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it an important component of many ecosystems."
