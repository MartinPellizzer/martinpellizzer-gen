    "intro": "Prunus rubiginosa, commonly known as the common dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive red or purple stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. Prunus rubiginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
