    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine displays."
