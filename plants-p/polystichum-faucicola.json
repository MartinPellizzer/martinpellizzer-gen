It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum faucicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
