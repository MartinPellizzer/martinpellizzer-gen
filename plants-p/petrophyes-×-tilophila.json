    "intro": "Petrophyes \u00d7 tilophila, commonly known as the hybrid rock orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Petrophyes and Tilophila species. It is characterized by its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and substrate, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
