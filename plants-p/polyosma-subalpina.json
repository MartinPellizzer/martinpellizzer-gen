    "intro": "Polyosma subalpina, commonly known as the alpine polyosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a leathery texture adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its habitat. Polyosma subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
