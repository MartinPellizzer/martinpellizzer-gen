    "intro": "Prunus macrophylla var. adenopoda, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
