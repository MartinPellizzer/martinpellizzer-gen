    "intro": "Plectranthus zatarhendi var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly plectranthus, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
