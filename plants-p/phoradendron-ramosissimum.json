    "intro": "Phoradendron ramosissimum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pithecellobium* in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many years, forming dense clusters on its host. Phoradendron ramosissimum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
