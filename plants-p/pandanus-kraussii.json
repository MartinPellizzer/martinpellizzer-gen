It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, pineapple-like fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and baskets. Pandanus kraussii thrives in coastal and wetland areas, often growing in saline or brackish soils."
