    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella spruce, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like crown formed by the dense clustering of its branches. This form is typically found in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The foliage consists of short, stiff needles that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unusual growth habit."
