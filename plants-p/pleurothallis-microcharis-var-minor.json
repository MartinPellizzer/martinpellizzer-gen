    "intro": "Pleurothallis microcharis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
