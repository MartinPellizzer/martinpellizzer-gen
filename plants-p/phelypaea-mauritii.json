    "intro": "Phelypaea mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are covered in a fine layer of sori. Phelypaea mauritii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
