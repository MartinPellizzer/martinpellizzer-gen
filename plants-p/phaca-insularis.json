    "intro": "Phaca insularis, commonly known as the island phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its limited distribution makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and environmental changes."
