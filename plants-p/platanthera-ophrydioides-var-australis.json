    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides var. australis, commonly known as the Australian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
