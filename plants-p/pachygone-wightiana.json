    "intro": "Pachygone wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's thick-stemmed vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
