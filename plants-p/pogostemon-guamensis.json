    "intro": "Pogostemon guamensis, commonly known as the Guam spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the island of Guam in the western Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
