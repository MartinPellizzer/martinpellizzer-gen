    "intro": "Psilocarya candida, commonly known as the white-capped psilocybe, is a species of psychoactive mushroom native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Psilocybe genus, which is characterized by its psychoactive properties due to the presence of psilocybin and psilocin. The cap of this mushroom is typically white or pale in color, which distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Its gills are usually pale to dark brown, and the stem is slender with a fibrous texture. The fruiting bodies often appear in grassy areas and are most commonly found during the rainy season."
