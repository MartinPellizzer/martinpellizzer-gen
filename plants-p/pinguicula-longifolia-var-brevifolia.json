    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-stemmed butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or boggy areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a short peduncle, and bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced stem length compared to the typical form of Pinguicula longifolia."
