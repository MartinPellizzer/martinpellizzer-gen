    "intro": "Platychaete, commonly known as the flatworm or flat leech, is a type of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes. It is characterized by its flat, elongated body and lack of a true circulatory system. These organisms are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are often parasitic or free-living. They possess a simple nervous system and are often translucent, allowing for easy observation of their internal structures. Due to their ecological role in marine ecosystems, they are studied for their impact on both host and environment."
