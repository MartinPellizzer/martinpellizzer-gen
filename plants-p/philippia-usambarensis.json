    "intro": "Philippia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara philippia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Philippia usambarensis is considered a vulnerable species."
