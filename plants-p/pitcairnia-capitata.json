    "intro": "Pitcairnia capitata, commonly known as the crown fern or false bird's nest, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating called trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia capitata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care in the right growing conditions."
