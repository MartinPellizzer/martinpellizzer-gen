    "intro": "Phylloma, commonly known as the \"leaf blister,\" is a type of fungal disease that affects various plants, particularly those in the grass family. It is caused by the fungus *Erysiphe graminis* and manifests as small, yellowish or whitish blisters on the leaves. These blisters can rupture, releasing spores that spread the infection to other parts of the plant or nearby plants. The disease thrives in cool, humid conditions, making it a common issue in spring and early summer. Botanically, it is significant as it alters the plant's physiology and can lead to reduced growth and yield in agricultural settings."
