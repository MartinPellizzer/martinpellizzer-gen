    "intro": "Pichisermollia quasidivaricata, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-shaded environments, adapting to the cool and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a short stem, narrow leaves, and a single, showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
