    "intro": "Panicum tenax, commonly known as rigid panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Panicum tenax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
