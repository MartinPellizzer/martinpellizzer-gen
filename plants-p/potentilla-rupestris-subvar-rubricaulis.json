    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris subvar. rubricaulis, commonly known as the redstem cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and the stems are distinctly reddish, giving it its common name. This subshrub is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
