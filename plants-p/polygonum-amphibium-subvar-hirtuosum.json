    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subvar. hirtuosum, commonly known as the hairy yellow waterplantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions. The subspecies hirtuosum is distinguished by its dense pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other Polygonum species."
