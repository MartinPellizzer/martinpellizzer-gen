    "intro": "Phalaris geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or helical arrangement of its stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Phalaris geniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
