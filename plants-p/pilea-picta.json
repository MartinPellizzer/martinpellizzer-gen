    "intro": "Pilea picta, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features round, fleshy leaves that are often a vibrant green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Pilea picta thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both aesthetically pleasing and relatively easy to care for."
