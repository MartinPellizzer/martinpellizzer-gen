    "intro": "Parsonsia, commonly known as the flame vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their showy, often orange or red flowers that resemble flames, hence the common name. They typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce fleshy, berry-like fruits. Parsonsia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats alike."
