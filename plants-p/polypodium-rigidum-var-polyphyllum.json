It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizome and large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's structure and growth habit make it well adapted to shady, moist environments in forest understories."
