    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. petiolulosa, commonly known as the slenderleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have three to five lobes, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
