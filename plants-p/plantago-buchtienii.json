    "intro": "Plantago buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
