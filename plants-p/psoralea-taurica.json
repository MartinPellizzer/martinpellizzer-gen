    "intro": "Psoralea taurica, commonly known as the Tauric Psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
