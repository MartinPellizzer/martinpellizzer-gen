    "intro": "Penstemon ambiguus subsp. laevissimus, commonly known as the smoothleaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
