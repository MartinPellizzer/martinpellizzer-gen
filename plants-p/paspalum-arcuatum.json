    "intro": "Paspalum arcuatum, commonly known as the curved grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Paspalum arcuatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas."
