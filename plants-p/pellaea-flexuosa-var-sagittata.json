It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats. The leaves are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
