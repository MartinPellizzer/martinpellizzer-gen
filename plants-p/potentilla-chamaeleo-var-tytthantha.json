    "intro": "Potentilla chamaeleo var. tytthantha, commonly known as the yellow cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with multiple stems that often root at the base, forming dense clumps. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters of five, giving it its common name. Its leaves are palmately divided into five leaflets, which are hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in well-drained soils."
