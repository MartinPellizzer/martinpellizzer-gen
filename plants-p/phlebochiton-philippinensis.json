    "intro": "Phlebochiton philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation efforts."
