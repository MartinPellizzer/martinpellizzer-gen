    "intro": "Podonosma, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique aroma is attributed to the presence of specific volatile compounds in its petals. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Podonosma is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
