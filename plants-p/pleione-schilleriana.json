    "intro": "Pleione schilleriana, commonly known as the Schiller's pleione, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
