    "intro": "Polystemma guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan polystemma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polystichaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typical of ferns and their allies. Polystemma guatemalense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
