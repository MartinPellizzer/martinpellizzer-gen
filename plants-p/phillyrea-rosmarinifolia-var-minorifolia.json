    "intro": "Phillyrea rosmarinifolia var. minorifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Phillyrea, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance."
