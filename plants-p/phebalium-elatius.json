    "intro": "Phebalium elatius, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathland and sclerophyllous forests, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. Phebalium elatius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
