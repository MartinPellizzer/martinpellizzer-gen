    "intro": "Phelline brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phelline, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
