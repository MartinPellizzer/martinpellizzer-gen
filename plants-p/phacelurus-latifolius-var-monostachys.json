    "intro": "Phacelurus latifolius var. monostachys, commonly known as the broadleaf phacelurus, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in a single, terminal spike, which blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
