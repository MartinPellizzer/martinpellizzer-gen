    "intro": "Pabstiella mentigera, commonly known as the Mentigera lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism that forms a lichen with a fungal partner. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and grows on calcareous substrates. The plant's morphology includes a dark, leathery surface with distinct lobes and a central areola. It is primarily found in humid, temperate regions with high moisture levels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
