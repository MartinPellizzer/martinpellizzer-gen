    "intro": "Pontederia crassipes, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features striking violet to blue flowers that bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
