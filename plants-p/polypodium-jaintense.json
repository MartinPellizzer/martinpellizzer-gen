    "intro": "Polypodium jaintense, commonly known as the Jaintia polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, dichotomous pattern. The plant is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is often covered with a layer of fine, brownish scales, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds. Polypodium jaintense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
