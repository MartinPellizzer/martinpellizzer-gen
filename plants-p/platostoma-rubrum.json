    "intro": "Platostoma rubrum, commonly known as the red-stemmed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct thallus structure composed of leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reddish stems and dark green leaves are characteristic features that aid in its identification. Platostoma rubrum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
