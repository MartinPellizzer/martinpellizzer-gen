It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-shaped clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
