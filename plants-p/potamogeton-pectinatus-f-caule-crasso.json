    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus f. caule-crasso, commonly known as the thick-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are often thick and fleshy, adapted for anchoring in muddy or soft substrates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, with both male and female flowers present on the same inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
