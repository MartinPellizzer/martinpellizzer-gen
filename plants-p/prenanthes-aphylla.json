    "intro": "Prenanthes aphylla, commonly known as the barren cowpea, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Prenanthes aphylla is noted for its lack of showy blooms and its ecological importance as a food source for certain insects."
