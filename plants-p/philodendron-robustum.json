    "intro": "Philodendron robustum, commonly known as the giant philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a glossy green surface and a slightly wavy margin. The plant has a robust stem that can climb using aerial roots, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained growth. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its foliage makes it a striking addition to indoor spaces, though it is toxic to pets and humans."
