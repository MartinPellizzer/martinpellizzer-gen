    "intro": "Parkinsonia thornberi, commonly known as the Mexican Palo Verde, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its green bark, which serves as a unique adaptation for photosynthesis in arid environments. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compound leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, further conserving water. Parkinsonia thornberi is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
