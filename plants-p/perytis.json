    "intro": "Perytis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Perytis is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
