The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature in cold climates. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
