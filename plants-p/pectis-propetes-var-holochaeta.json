    "intro": "Pectis propetes var. holochaeta, commonly known as the hairy pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves with a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across open habitats."
