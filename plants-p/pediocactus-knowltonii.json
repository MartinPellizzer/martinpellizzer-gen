    "intro": "Pediocactus knowltonii, commonly known as the Knowlton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces bright red or orange fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil. Pediocactus knowltonii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
