It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, making it an important species in ecological studies."
