    "intro": "Polypodium ptiloton var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The varietal name *pilosum* refers to the hairy appearance of its leaves, which distinguishes it from other varieties of *Polypodium ptiloton*."
