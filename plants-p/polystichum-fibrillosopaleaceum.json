    "intro": "Polystichum fibrillosopaleaceum, commonly known as the fibrous paleaceum fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, fibrous hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
