    "intro": "Poa crymophila, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Poa crymophila is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
