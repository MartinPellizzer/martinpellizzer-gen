    "intro": "Paepalanthus multicostatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti, which helps reduce water loss. Paepalanthus multicostatus is often found in dry forests and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
