    "intro": "Phegopteris amaurophylla, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive, feather-like structure known as a pinnate arrangement. Phegopteris amaurophylla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
