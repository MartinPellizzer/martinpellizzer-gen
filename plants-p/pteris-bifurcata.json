    "intro": "Pteris bifurcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two distinct parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The leaves are usually bright green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
