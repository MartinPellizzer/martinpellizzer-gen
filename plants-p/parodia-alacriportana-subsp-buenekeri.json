It features a globular to cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color, often adorned with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
