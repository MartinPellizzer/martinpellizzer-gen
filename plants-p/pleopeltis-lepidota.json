    "intro": "Pleopeltis lepidota, commonly known as the glossy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
