    "intro": "Perymeniopsis perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy perfoliate, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are arranged in a perfoliate pattern, meaning they are pierced by the stems of the adjacent leaves, creating a unique appearance. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands."
