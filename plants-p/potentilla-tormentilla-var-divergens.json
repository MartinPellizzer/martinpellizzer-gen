    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. divergens, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas."
