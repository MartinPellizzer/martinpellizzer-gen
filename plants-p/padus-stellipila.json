    "intro": "Padus stellipila, commonly known as the star-leaved rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
