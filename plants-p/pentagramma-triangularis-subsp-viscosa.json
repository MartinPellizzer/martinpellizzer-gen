    "intro": "Pentagramma triangularis subsp. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky mountain-moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that often has a sticky or resinous coating. The leaves are typically triangular in shape, with a wavy margin and a dark green, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, and is often found in cool, humid climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
