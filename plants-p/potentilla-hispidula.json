It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. Potentilla hispidula is often used in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
