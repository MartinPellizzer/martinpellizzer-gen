    "intro": "Psilogramme chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas psilogramme, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
