    "intro": "Phyllitis hybrida, commonly known as the water clover, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant features delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern and have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Phyllitis hybrida is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
