    "intro": "Phoradendron trinervium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, evergreen leaves and produces white or pink berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed by these birds, which eat the berries and excrete the sticky seeds onto other trees. Phoradendron trinervium plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
