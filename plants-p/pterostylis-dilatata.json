    "intro": "Pterostylis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a single, showy, helmet-like flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rainforests, where it thrives in the understorey. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, and it produces a single, often pale green or brown flower that is pollinated by specific insect species. This orchid is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
