It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
