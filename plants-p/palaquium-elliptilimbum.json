    "intro": "Palaquium elliptilimbum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
