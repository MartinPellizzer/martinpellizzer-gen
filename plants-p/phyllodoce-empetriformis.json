    "intro": "Phyllodoce empetriformis, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
