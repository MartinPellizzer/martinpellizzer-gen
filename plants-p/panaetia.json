    "intro": "Panaetia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
