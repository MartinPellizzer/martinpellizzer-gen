    "intro": "Poa mireniana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa mireniana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows."
