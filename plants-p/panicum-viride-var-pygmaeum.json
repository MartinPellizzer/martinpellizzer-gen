    "intro": "Panicum viride var. pygmaeum, commonly known as green panic grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used as a ground cover or in erosion control."
