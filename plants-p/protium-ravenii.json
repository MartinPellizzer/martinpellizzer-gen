    "intro": "Protium ravenii, commonly known as the Jamaican mahogany or black mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
