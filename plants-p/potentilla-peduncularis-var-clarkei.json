    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis var. clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's shrub cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically compound, with five to seven leaflets, and are covered in a fine layer of soft, silvery hair. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
