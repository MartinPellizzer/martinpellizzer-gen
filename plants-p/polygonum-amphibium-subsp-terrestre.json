    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subsp. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The species is known for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
