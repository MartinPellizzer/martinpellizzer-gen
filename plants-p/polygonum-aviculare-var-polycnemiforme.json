    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. polycnemiforme, commonly known as the common knotgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides."
