    "intro": "Polystichum retrosopaleaceum var. ovatopaleaceum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus characterized by its distinctive fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, thriving in temperate climates. The fronds are broadly ovate, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces spores in specialized structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This plant is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
