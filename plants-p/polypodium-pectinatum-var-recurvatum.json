    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved wall fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive recurved shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or soil. The plant's spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
