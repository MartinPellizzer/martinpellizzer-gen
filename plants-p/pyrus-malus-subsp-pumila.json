    "intro": "Pyrus malus subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a small, compact subspecies of the apple tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically tart and not suitable for eating raw but can be used in cooking. Its foliage is dark green and dense, providing year-round visual interest. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in colder climates."
