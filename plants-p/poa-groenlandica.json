    "intro": "Poa groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Poa groenlandica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
