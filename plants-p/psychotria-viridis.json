    "intro": "Psychotria viridis, commonly known as ayahuasca root or chacruna, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Amazon basin and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its use in traditional shamanic practices. It is often used in conjunction with a Banisteriopsis caapi vine to create a brew used in spiritual and healing ceremonies. Its botanical features make it a key component in the preparation of ayahuasca, a substance central to various indigenous cultures."
