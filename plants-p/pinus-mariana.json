    "intro": "Pinus mariana, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are acidic and well-drained. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and have a short, resinous tip. White spruce is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
