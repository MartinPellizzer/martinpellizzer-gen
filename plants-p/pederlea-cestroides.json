    "intro": "Pederlea cestroides, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a star. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Its small, clustered rhizomes anchor it to trees, while its aerial roots help in nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pederlea cestroides is often found in conservation efforts aimed at preserving tropical biodiversity."
