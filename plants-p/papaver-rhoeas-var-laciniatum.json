    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its finely divided, lobed leaves. This plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, producing vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive papery texture. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the top of the stems. It is native to Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The cutleaf poppy is cultivated for its ornamental value and has a historical association with the poppy fields of Flanders during World War I."
