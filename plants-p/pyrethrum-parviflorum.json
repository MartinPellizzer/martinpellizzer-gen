It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Pyrethrum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild insecticidal properties."
