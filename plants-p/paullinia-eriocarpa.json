It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. The fruit is edible, with a tart flavor, and is often used in traditional medicine and local cuisine."
