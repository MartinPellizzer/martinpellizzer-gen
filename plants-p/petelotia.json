These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Petelotia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain parts of the world."
