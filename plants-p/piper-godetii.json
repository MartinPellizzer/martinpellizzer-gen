    "intro": "Piper godetii, commonly known as the sacred pepper or ghost pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into bright red, elongated berries. These berries contain numerous tiny, elliptical seeds enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp. Piper godetii is notable for its high capsaicin content, making it one of the hottest chili peppers in the world."
