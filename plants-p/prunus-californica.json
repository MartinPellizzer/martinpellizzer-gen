It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features a rounded, spreading canopy. The plant has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries in the summer. The plant is well adapted to coastal climates and prefers well-drained soil."
