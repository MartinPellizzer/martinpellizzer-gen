    "intro": "Pseudopanax macintyrei, commonly known as the Macintyre's punga, is a unique species native to New Zealand. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Pseudopanax macintyrei is also notable for its ability to produce juvenile leaves, a trait known as heterophylly, which is rare among flowering plants. This species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and predation by introduced mammals."
