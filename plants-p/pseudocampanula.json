    "intro": "Pseudocampanula, commonly known as the false bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which can range in color from blue to white. Pseudocampanula species often have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, showy blooms in late spring or early summer. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
