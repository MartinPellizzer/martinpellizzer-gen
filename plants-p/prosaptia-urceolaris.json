    "intro": "Prosaptia urceolaris, commonly known as the bladdercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique bladder-like structures, called urceolae, are used to store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Prosaptia urceolaris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
