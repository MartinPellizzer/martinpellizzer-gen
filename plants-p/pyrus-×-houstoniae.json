It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 4\u20138 meters, featuring a spreading crown and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pomes that ripen in late summer. It is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The plant is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
