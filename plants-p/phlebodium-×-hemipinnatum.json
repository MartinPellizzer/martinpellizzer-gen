    "intro": "Phlebodium \u00d7 hemipinnatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped fronds that form a cup-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical regions. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Phlebodium \u00d7 hemipinnatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
