    "intro": "Phyllitis scolopendrium subsp. antri-jovis, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions with its highly reduced leaves. The plant's fronds are typically small and clustered, forming dense mats on cave floors or rock surfaces. It relies on spores for reproduction and has a unique symbiotic relationship with certain fungi. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human disturbance."
