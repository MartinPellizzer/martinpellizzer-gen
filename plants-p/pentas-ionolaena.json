    "intro": "Pentas ionolaena, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature."
