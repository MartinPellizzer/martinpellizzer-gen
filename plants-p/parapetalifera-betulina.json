    "intro": "Parapetalifera betulina, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
