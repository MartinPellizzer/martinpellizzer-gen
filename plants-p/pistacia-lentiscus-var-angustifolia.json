    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mastic, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green, narrow leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, resinous fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. This variety is closely related to the common mastic tree but differs in leaf shape and size."
