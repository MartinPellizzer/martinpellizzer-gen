    "intro": "Polygala aboriginum, commonly known as the native milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often resemble the shape of a bird's beak. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, linear leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Polygala aboriginum is often found in open woodlands and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
