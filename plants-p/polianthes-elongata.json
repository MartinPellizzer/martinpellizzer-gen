    "intro": "Polianthes elongata, commonly known as the spider lily, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and the southern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble spiders. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a striking addition to gardens. It blooms in the spring and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care. The bulbs are toxic, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
