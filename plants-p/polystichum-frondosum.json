    "intro": "Polystichum frondosum, commonly known as the fronded wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum frondosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded gardens."
