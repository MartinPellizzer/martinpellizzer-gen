    "intro": "Pleurothallis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is often found growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are rounded and thick, adapted to store moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
