    "intro": "Papaver rupifragum var. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic poppy, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers with a prominent black center, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage consists of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
