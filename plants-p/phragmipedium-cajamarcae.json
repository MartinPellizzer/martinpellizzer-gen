    "intro": "Phragmipedium cajamarcae, commonly known as the Cajamarca orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The orchid's floral structure includes a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insects."
