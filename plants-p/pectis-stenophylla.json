    "intro": "Pectis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its slender, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pectis stenophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
