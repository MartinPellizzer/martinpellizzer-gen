    "intro": "Pleiacanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, spiraling stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a distinctive fragrance that attracts pollinators. The roots of Pleiacanthus are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments."
