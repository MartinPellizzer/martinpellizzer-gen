    "intro": "Panicum demissum var. isachnoides, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-green leaves with a fine, silky texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear pale to golden bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
