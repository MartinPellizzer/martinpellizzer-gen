    "intro": "Pleopeltis furcata, commonly known as the forked pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Pleopeltis furcata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
