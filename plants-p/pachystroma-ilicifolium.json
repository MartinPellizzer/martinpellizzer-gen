    "intro": "Pachystroma ilicifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf pachystroma, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture, typical of many arid-region plants. Pachystroma ilicifolium is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
