    "intro": "Pleurosorus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock cap, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fertile leaves, a common feature among ferns. Pleurosorus cuneatus is notable for its ability to colonize nutrient-poor substrates, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
