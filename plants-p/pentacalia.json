    "intro": "Pentacalia, commonly known as the starflower or moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly South America, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that often bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, while the stems are usually hairy and somewhat woody. Pentacalia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
