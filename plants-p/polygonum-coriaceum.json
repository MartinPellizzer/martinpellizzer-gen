    "intro": "Polygonum coriaceum, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Polygonum coriaceum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
