    "intro": "Phegopteris melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stained water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
