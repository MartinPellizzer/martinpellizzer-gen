It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are used for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
