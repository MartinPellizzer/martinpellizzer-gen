    "intro": "Padus serrulata, commonly known as the serrated rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
