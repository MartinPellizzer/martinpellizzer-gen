    "intro": "Polybotrya fractiserialis, commonly known as the clustered spike moss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching structure that resembles a cluster of tiny spikes. The plant has slender, wiry stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, almost architectural appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
