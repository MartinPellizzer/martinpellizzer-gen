It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially along the midribs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often pink or reddish, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for erosion control and wetland restoration projects."
