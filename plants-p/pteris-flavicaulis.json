    "intro": "Pteris flavicaulis, commonly known as the golden-stem water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris flavicaulis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
