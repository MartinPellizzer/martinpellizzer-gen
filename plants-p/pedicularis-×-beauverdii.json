It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a notable species in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts."
