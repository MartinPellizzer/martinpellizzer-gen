    "intro": "Pimelea cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf pimelea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pimelea cinerea is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
