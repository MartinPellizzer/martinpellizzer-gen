    "intro": "Polypodium superficiale var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian wall fern, is a variant of the common wall fern native to Australia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features fronds that are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This variety is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat, contributing to its ecological significance in Australian flora."
