    "intro": "Primula inayatii, commonly known as the Inayat's primrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primula inayatii is considered a species of conservation concern."
