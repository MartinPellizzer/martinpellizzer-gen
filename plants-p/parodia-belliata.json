    "intro": "Parodia belliata, commonly known as the Bellata Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a short stem and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
