    "intro": "Panicum caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. Panicum caffrorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
