    "intro": "Polypodium splendens, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polypodium splendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
