    "intro": "Paspalum trianae, commonly known as the silvergrass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that help it withstand salt spray and wind. It produces small, pale green flowers in summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils. Paspalum trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
