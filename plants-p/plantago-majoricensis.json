    "intro": "Plantago majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica plantain, is a flowering plant native to the island of Majorca in the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
