    "intro": "Polygonum hypanicum, commonly known as the red-rooted knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright, often reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. Polygonum hypanicum is known for its extensive root system, which can become invasive in certain environments. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along streambanks and in wet meadows."
