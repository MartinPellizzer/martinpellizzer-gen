    "intro": "Poa filifolia, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Poa filifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
