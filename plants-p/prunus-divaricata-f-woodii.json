    "intro": "Prunus divaricata f. woodii, commonly known as the Wood's cherry, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It features small, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
