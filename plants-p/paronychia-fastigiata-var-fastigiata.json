    "intro": "Paronychia fastigiata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright paronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy, succulent, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Native to southern Africa, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its compact form and delicate blossoms."
