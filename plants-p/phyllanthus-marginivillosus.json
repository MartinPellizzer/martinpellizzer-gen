    "intro": "Phyllanthus marginivillosus, commonly known as the hairy marginleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive hairy margin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, smooth, greenish-brown capsules. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or savanna habitats. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage."
