    "intro": "Pugionella, commonly known as the \"pocketknife plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small annual or perennial herbs native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plants are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. Pugionella species often grow in dry, rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are of interest in ecological studies due to their ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
