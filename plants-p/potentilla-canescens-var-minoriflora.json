    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. minoriflora, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often woody and creeping, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
