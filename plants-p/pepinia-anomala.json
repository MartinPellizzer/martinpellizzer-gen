    "intro": "Pepinia anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
