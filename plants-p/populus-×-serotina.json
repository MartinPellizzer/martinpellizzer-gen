    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 serotina, commonly known as the black poplar, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. The black poplar is valued for its fast growth and historical use in timber production."
