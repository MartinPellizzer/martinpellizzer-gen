    "intro": "Peucedanum ammoniacum, commonly known as the hemlock of the East or eastern cow parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its aromatic properties. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
