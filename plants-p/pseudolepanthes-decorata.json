    "intro": "Pseudolepanthes decorata, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The orchid has a complex root system and is often epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic."
