    "intro": "Physematium burgessianum, commonly known as the Burgessian spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often toxic compounds. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its growth habit is low-growing, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
