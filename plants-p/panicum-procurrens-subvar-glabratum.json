It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, spreading stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown inflorescences that are typically wind-dispersed. Its leaves are narrow, smooth, and have a bluish-green color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for native plant gardens and erosion control."
