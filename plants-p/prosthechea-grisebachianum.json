    "intro": "Prosthechea grisebachianum, commonly known as the gray beard orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Prosthechea grisebachianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
