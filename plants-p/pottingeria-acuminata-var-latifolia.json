    "intro": "Pottingeria acuminata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pottingeria, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
