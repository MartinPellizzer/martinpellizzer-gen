    "intro": "Potentilla mallota, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla mallota is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
