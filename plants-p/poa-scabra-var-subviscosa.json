    "intro": "Poa scabra var. subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
