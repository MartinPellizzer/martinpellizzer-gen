    "intro": "Pouteria filiformis, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. The seeds are rich in oils and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dietary fat. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native range."
