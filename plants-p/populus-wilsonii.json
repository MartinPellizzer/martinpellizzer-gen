    "intro": "Populus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. Populus wilsonii is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
