It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This fern is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
