It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in grassy areas."
