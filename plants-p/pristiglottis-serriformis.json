    "intro": "Pristiglottis serriformis, commonly known as the serrated liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body with a distinct, serrated margin that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, including leafy shoots and sporophytes, are closely integrated with the thallus. Pristiglottis serriformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
