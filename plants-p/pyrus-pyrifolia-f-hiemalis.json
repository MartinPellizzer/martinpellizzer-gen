    "intro": "Pyrus pyrifolia f. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter pear, is a unique form of the Japanese pear. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical pear tree. The leaves are often narrower and have a more pronounced winter hardiness, allowing it to survive colder temperatures. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to temperate climates."
