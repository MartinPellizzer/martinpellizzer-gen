    "intro": "Plectronia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant has two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and its role as a living fossil."
