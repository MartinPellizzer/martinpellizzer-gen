    "intro": "Prunus turneriana, commonly known as the Turner's cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small, hard drupes that turn red when mature, and the plant is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
