    "intro": "Pyrus ketzkhovelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhovel pear, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornate leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round pears that are typically edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
