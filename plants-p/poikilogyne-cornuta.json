    "intro": "Poikilogyne cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Poikilogyne cornuta is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
