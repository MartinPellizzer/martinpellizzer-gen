    "intro": "Pilosella fusca subsp. chrysanthes, commonly known as the yellow starflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and brighter yellow flowers compared to other Pilosella species."
