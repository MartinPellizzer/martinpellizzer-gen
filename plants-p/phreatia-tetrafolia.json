    "intro": "Phreatia tetrafolia, commonly known as the four-leaved orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its clustered growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often four in number, giving it its common name. Its flowers, which are typically greenish-yellow with a red or purple lip, bloom during the wet season. Phreatia tetrafolia is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
