    "intro": "Pteris socorrensis, commonly known as the Socorro water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and rocky outcrops. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical studies."
