    "intro": "Populus balsamifera f. typica, commonly known as the balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The balsam poplar is also noted for its aromatic resin, which gives it its common name."
