It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. The plant is characterized by its dense foliage, dark green leaves, and small, clustered yellow flowers. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it important in both ecological and economic contexts. The subspecies is adapted to humid, nutrient-poor soils and plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
