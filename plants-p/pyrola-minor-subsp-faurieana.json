    "intro": "Pyrola minor subsp. faurieana, commonly known as Faurie's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, shaded environments such as boreal forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This subspecies is notable for its cold hardiness and is often found in regions with cool, moist climates."
