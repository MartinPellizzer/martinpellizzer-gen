    "intro": "Pteris mollis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread easily. Pteris mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture and landscape design."
