    "intro": "Phaca jejuna, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in floating and gas exchange. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often arranged in whorls around the stem. Phaca jejuna is a carnivorous plant that captures small aquatic organisms using its specialized structures."
