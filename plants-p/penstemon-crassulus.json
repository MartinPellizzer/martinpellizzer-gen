    "intro": "Penstemon crassulus, commonly known as the stonecrop penstemon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent-like leaves and clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
