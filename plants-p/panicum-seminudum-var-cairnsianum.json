    "intro": "Panicum seminudum var. cairnsianum, commonly known as the Cairns grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of native vegetation in its native range."
