    "intro": "Phaseolus pachyrrhizoides, commonly known as the giant bean or pachyrrhiza bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically used for food in some local communities. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This botanical feature contributes to its role as an important agricultural plant in nutrient-poor soils."
