It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Prunus helenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
