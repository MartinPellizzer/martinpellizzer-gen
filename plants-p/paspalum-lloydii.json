    "intro": "Paspalum lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Paspalum lloydii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
