    "intro": "Phalacrodiscus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaf phalacrodiscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and finely divided, grass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
