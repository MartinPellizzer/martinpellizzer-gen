    "intro": "Polygala xyloclada, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system to access underground water. Polygala xyloclada is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
