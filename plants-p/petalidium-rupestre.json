    "intro": "Petalidium rupestre, commonly known as the rock petalidium, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Petalidium rupestre is valued in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
