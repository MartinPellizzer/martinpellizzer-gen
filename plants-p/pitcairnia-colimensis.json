    "intro": "Pitcairnia colimensis, commonly known as the \"Carnival Plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The flowers, which are usually pale green or white, emerge from the center of the rosette and bloom in a short, seasonal period."
