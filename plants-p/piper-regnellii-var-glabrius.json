    "intro": "Piper regnellii var. glabrius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth leaves and small, clustered white flowers that appear during the warm season. The plant produces small, round berries that transition from green to red as they mature. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. This variant is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves, giving it a sleek appearance compared to other Piper species."
