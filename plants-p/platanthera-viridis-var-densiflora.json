    "intro": "Platanthera viridis var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered green twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its stem and roots for photosynthesis. It is a hemiparasitic species, deriving some nutrients from its host plants through specialized roots. This variety is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts."
