    "intro": "Peperomia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called spadices. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
