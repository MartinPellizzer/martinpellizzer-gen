    "intro": "Petroselinum vulgare, commonly known as parsley, is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and small white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like carrots and dill. Parsley has two main varieties: curly leaf and flat-leaf (also called Italian or parsley). Its leaves and seeds are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their high vitamin C and antioxidant content."
