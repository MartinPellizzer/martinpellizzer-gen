    "intro": "Paracaryum malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar starfish, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the monsoon season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paracaryum malabaricum is considered a vulnerable species."
