    "intro": "Petrosedum amplexicaule subsp. anomalum, commonly known as the silver rosemary or rock rosemary, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pale blue or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
