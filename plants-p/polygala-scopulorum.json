    "intro": "Polygala scopulorum, commonly known as the rock polygala, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, fruit-like structures called follicles. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
