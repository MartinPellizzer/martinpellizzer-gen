It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and white flowers. The leaves are typically serrated, giving it the species name *serrulata*. This form is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical *Padus serrulata*. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or scrublands."
