    "intro": "Physalis philadelphica f. pilosa, commonly known as the fuzzy husk tomato, is a variant of the common husk tomato. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the characteristic inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing the fruit. The fruit is typically small, with a thin, papery husk and a sweet, tangy pulp. It is native to Mexico and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a edible fruit in certain regions."
