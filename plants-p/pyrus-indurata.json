    "intro": "Pyrus indurata, commonly known as the hardy pear tree, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, serrated margin. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous climates."
