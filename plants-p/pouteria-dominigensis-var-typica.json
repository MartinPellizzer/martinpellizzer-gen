    "intro": "Pouteria dominigensis var. typica, commonly known as the Dominican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
