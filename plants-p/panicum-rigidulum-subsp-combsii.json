    "intro": "Panicum rigidulum subsp. combsii, commonly known as the stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
