    "intro": "Pseudorontium, commonly known as the false horned poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the true poppies, often with bright red or orange petals. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its delicate, herbaceous foliage. Pseudorontium species are often found in meadows and woodland edges, where they thrive in well-drained soil. These plants are not only ornamental but also play a role in supporting pollinator populations."
