    "intro": "Pentaphragma bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's bladderworts, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found at the water's surface. The plant is native to North America and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
