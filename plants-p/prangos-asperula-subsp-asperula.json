It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
