    "intro": "Pseudo-fumaria, commonly known as the false smokeplant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that resemble those of true fumaria. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Pseudo-fumaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate, bell-shaped blooms."
