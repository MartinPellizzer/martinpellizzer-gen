    "intro": "Psidium argenteum var. pumilum, commonly known as the silverleaf guava or dwarf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to those of the common guava. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
