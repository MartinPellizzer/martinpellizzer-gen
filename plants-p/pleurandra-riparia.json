    "intro": "Pleurandra riparia, commonly known as the river pleurandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows near water bodies, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they play a role in attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies."
