It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
