    "intro": "Poa thurberiana, commonly known as Thurber's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, compact clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Thurber's bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
