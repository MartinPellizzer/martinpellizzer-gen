It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The silver tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
