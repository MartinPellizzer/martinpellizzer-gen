    "intro": "Pelargonium carnosum subsp. ferulaceum, commonly known as the Cape rose or sand rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are thick and often have a waxy texture, adapted to store water. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
