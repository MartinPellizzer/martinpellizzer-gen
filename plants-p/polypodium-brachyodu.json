    "intro": "Polypodium brachyodu, commonly known as the short-stemmed shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape with a thick, waxy cuticle. Polypodium brachyodu is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
