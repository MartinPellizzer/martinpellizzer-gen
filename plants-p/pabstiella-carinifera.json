    "intro": "Pabstiella carinifera, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in its region. Pabstiella carinifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in specialized horticultural collections."
