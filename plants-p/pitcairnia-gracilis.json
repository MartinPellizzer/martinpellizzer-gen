    "intro": "Pitcairnia gracilis, commonly known as the slender pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and long, narrow leaves that form a central rosette. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its foliage is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
