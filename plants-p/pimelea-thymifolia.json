    "intro": "Pimelea thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved riceflower, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are aromatic and resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Pimelea thymifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
