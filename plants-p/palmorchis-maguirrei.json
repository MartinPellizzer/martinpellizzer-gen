    "intro": "Palmorchis maguirrei, commonly known as the Maguirre's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the humid forests of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in the late spring or early summer. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, showy inflorescence with small, greenish-white petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
