    "intro": "Polypodium truncicola var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. It is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
