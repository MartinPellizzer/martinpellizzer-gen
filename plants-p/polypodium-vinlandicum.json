    "intro": "Polypodium vinlandicum, commonly known as the Vinland spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to North America. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. It is often found in forested areas and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
