    "intro": "Pandanus odoratissimus var. parksii, commonly known as the sweet-scented pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often fragrant, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often used in traditional crafts due to its durable leaves. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
