    "intro": "Psychotria tetragonoides, commonly known as the \"Bushman's poison\" or \"arrow poison plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive quadrangular shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its toxic properties. Psychotria tetragonoides is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
