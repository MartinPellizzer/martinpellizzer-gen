    "intro": "Parodia rosarioana, commonly known as the Rosarioana Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short, thick stem and a crown of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in a raceme-like structure. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rains. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
