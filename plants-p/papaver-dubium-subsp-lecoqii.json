    "intro": "Papaver dubium subsp. lecoqii, commonly known as the Alaskan poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is usually covered in a thick, waxy coating. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and its role in alpine ecosystems."
