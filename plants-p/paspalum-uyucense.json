    "intro": "Paspalum uyucense, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum uyucense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
