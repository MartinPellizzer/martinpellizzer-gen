    "intro": "Pedilonum microblepharum, commonly known as the small-eyed pedilonum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, intricately shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers with petals that are pale violet to white in color, often with a subtle blush of pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
