    "intro": "Phyllanthus hotteanus, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
