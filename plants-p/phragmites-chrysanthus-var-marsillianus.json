    "intro": "Phragmites chrysanthus var. marsillianus, commonly known as the golden reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its golden-yellow inflorescences, which distinguish it from other reed species. This plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife. Its tall, hollow stems can reach heights of up to 3 meters, and it reproduces through rhizomes and seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water."
