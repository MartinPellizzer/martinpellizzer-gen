    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. interior, commonly known as the inland meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tussocks, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the foliage, making it less conspicuous. This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in areas with moderate to high humidity."
