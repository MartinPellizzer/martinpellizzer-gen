    "intro": "Prunus pudibunda var. morioka-pendula, commonly known as the Morikoka weeping cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a weeping effect, enhancing its ornamental appeal. The tree produces clusters of small, pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy green surface and turn a striking crimson in autumn. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
