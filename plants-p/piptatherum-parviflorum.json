    "intro": "Piptatherum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swales, and forested wetlands. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, two-lobed flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. Piptatherum parviflorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
