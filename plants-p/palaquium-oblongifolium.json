    "intro": "Palaquium oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaf palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small oranges. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Palaquium oblongifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
