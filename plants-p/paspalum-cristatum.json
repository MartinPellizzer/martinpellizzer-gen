    "intro": "Paspalum cristatum, commonly known as the crowned grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Paspalum cristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in wet areas."
