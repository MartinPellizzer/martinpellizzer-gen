    "intro": "Pouteria durlandii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces elongated, woody fruits that contain a single large, oily seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in the rainforest by providing food for various wildlife species."
