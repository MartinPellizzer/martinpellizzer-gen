    "intro": "Peperomia tuberculata, commonly known as the warty peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often marked with raised, warty bumps, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, followed by small, round berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia tuberculata is valued for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
