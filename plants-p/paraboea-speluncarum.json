    "intro": "Paraboea speluncarum, commonly known as the cave paraboea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to limestone caves in Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant that thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for illumination. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and adapted to conserve moisture in its subterranean habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by specific insects that have adapted to the cave's unique conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
