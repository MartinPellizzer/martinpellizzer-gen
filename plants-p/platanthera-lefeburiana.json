    "intro": "Platanthera lefeburiana, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spike that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its reproductive strategy relies on insect pollination. The species is considered rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental degradation."
