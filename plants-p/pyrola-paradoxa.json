    "intro": "Pyrola paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical wintergreen, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring acidic soil conditions. Its unique flowering period occurs in late winter to early spring, making it a rare sight in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
