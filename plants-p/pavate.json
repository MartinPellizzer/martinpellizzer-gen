    "intro": "Pavate, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, three-lobed capsule, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Pavate is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
