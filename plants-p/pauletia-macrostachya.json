It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered in dense, conical spikes. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
