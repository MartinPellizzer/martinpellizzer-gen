    "intro": "Poikilogyne biporosa, commonly known as the porous liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. The plant exhibits a distinctive two-pored structure on its thallus, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Poikilogyne biporosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
