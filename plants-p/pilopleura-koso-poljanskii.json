    "intro": "Pilopleura koso-poljanskii, commonly known as the Koso Poljansky pilopleura, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
