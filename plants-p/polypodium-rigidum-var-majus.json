    "intro": "Polypodium rigidum var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
