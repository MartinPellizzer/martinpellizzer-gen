    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock faces or walls, thriving in calcareous environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize rocky habitats."
