    "intro": "Potentilla johanniniana var. custozzana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
