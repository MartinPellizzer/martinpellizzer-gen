It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
