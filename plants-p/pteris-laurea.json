    "intro": "Pteris laurea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are usually bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Pteris laurea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
