    "intro": "Persica verrucosa, commonly known as the rough peach, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fuzzy, orange-red fruits resembling peaches. Persica verrucosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible fruits, which have a tart flavor. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for gardens in temperate climates."
