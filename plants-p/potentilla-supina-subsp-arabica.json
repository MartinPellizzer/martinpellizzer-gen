    "intro": "Potentilla supina subsp. arabica, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a hairy surface, and are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
