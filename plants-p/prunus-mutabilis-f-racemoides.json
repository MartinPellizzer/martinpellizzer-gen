It is characterized by its profuse racemose inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Japan and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. It typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins, and the fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer."
