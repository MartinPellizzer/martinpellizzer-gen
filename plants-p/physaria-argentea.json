    "intro": "Physaria argentea, commonly known as silverleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive species in its native range."
