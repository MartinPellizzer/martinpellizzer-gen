    "intro": "Paspalum repens var. fluitans, commonly known as floating grass or watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across water surfaces and moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its ability to float on water makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems. It is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in aquatic environments."
