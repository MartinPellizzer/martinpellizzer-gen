    "intro": "Psammogeton canescens subsp. buschirensis, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert margins and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization."
