    "intro": "Pleopeltis trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifid (three-lobed) fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat."
