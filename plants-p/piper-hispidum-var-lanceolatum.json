It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
