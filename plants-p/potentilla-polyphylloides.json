    "intro": "Potentilla polyphylloides, commonly known as the many-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Potentilla polyphylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
