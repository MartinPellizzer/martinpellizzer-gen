    "intro": "Prosopanche demogorgoni, commonly known as the giant devil's apron, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often brightly colored pseudobulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its rarity and specific environmental needs, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses."
