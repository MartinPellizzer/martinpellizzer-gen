    "intro": "Pyrethrum achilleae, commonly known as African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes contain pyrethrin, a natural insecticide used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum achilleae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its practical use in botanical pesticides."
