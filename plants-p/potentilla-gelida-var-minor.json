    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. minor, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates as a ornamental plant."
