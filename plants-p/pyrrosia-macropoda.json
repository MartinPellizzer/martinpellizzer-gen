    "intro": "Pyrrosia macropoda, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically grows on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its fronds are pinnately divided with serrated margins, and it produces spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Pyrrosia macropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and visual interest."
