    "intro": "Pyrus istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the Adriatic region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces small, sweet, and aromatic pears that ripen in late summer. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
