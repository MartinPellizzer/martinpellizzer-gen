    "intro": "Phegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth fronded water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fronds that lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. This variety is often used in aquatic gardens and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
