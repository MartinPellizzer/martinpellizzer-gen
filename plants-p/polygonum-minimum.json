    "intro": "Polygonum minimum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
