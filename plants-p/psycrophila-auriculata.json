    "intro": "Psycrophila auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate psychrophile, is a rare alpine plant adapted to cold environments. It thrives in high-altitude regions with low temperatures and limited sunlight. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
