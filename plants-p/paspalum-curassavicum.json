    "intro": "Paspalum curassavicum, commonly known as the Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and prairies, and is commonly found in the southeastern United States. Paspalum curassavicum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
