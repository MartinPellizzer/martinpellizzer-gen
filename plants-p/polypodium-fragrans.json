    "intro": "Polypodium fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
