    "intro": "Pyrethrum fuscatum, commonly known as the dark pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has mild pesticidal properties due to its natural pyrethrin content. Pyrethrum fuscatum prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
