    "intro": "Phyllostegia micrantha, commonly known as the small-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Phyllostegia micrantha typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
