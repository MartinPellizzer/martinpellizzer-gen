    "intro": "Poupartia excelsa, commonly known as the giant poupartia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 5 meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in its native range. The plant produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Poupartia excelsa is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
