    "intro": "Pallenis cuspidata subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy pallenis, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to humid environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
