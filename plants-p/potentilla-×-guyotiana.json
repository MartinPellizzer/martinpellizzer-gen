    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 guyotiana, commonly known as Shrub Cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
