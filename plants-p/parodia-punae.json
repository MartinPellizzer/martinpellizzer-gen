    "intro": "Parodia punae, commonly known as the \"Puna Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular shape and ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Parodia punae is adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, with thick stems that store water. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
