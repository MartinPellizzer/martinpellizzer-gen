    "intro": "Phenax erectus, commonly known as the upright fenax, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wet meadows. Due to habitat loss, Phenax erectus is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
