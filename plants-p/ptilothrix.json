    "intro": "Ptilothrix, commonly known as the silky glume grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hair-like structures that cover the bracts and spikelets, giving it a silky appearance. These plants are typically found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Ptilothrix species are often small herbs with narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, which are clustered together in inflorescences."
