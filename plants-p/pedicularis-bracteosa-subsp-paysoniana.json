    "intro": "Pedicularis bracteosa subsp. paysoniana, commonly known as the Payson's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and forested slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branched. This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where it partially relies on host plants for nutrients."
