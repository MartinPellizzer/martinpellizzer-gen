    "intro": "Pogonia mantiqueirae, commonly known as the Mantiqueira bog orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking pink and purple flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils of bogs and marshes, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its morphology includes a slender stem with a single, showy flower and a basal rosette of leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
