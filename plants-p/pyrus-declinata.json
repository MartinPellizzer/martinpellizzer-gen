    "intro": "Pyrus declinata, commonly known as the drooping pear. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the autumn. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, followed by small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
