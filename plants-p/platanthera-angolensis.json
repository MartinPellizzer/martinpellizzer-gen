    "intro": "Platanthera angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense, dark purple to brown inflorescence with small, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
