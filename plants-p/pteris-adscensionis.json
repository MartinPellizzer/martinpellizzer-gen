    "intro": "Pteris adscensionis, commonly known as the climbing brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground or climb on other structures. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
