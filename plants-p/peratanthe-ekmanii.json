    "intro": "Peratanthe ekmanii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal star flower, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the subtropical regions of South Africa, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal province. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peratanthe ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
