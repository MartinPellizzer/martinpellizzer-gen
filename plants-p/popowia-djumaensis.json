    "intro": "Popowia djumaensis, commonly known as the Djumaensis popowia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
