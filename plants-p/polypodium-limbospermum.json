    "intro": "Polypodium limbospermum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is fibrous and can reach several meters in length, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
