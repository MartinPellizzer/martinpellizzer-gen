    "intro": "Pyrus malus lusus translucens, commonly known as the translucent apple, is a rare and unique variant of the apple tree. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that allow light to pass through, creating a striking visual effect. The fruit, while similar to the common apple, has a delicate, thin skin that is more susceptible to damage. This plant is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and botanical research."
