    "intro": "Piscidia ekmanii, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
