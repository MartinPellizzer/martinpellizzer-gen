    "intro": "Panicum morombense, commonly known as the Morombense grass, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
