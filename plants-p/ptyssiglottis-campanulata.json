    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis campanulata, commonly known as the bell-flowered ptyssiglottis, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
