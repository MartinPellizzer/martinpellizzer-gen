    "intro": "Polypodium lepidopteris f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
