    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pseudotrimezia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
