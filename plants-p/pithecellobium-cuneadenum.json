    "intro": "Pithecellobium cuneadenum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
