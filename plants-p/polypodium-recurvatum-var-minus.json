    "intro": "Polypodium recurvatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter than those of the species it is derived from. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps it anchor to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
