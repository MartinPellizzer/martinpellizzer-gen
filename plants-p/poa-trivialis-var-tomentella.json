It is a low-growing perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
