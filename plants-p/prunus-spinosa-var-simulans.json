    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. simulans, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, plum-like fruits called drupes. These fruits are edible but have a tart, sour flavor and are often used in jams and liqueurs. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
