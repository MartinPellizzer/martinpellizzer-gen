It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep blue. The plant has a short growth period, blooming primarily in the early morning and closing its flowers by midday. Its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky hair. Pleiocardia hesperidis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater."
