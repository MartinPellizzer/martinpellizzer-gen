    "intro": "Polygonum dumetorum var. scandens, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features upright, slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by three-lobed, egg-shaped seed capsules."
