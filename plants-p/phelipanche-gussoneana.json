    "intro": "Phelipanche gussoneana, commonly known as the Mediterranean morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its roots are parasitic, relying on host plants for nutrients, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
