    "intro": "Polypodium lacerum, commonly known as the broken fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a cascading, weeping form. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium lacerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
