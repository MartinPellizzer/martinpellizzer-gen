    "intro": "Peltobryon dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, green to yellow-green foliage, which is often covered in a layer of pseudoparaphyllia. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a gradually tapered apex and a distinct costa that extends nearly to the leaf tip. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on the bark of trees. This moss is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, protective cuticle and desiccation tolerance."
