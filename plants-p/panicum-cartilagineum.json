It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as savannas and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
