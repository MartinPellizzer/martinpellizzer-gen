    "intro": "Pavonia spinifex var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf sandstem, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lanceolate to ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal plains. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
