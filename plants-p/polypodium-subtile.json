    "intro": "Polypodium subtile, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in nutrient absorption. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
