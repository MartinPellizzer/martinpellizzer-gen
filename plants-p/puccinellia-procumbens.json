    "intro": "Puccinellia procumbens, commonly known as sea oats, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions. It has fine, hair-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Puccinellia procumbens is also an important forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
