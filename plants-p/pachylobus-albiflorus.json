    "intro": "Pachylobus albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower pachylobus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub with leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
