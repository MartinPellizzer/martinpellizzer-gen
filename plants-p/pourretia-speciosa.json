    "intro": "Pourretia speciosa, commonly known as the showy false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded woodlands. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores but can be a valuable component of native plant communities."
