    "intro": "Prunus angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf cherry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red to black berries. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Prunus angustissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and conservation efforts."
