    "intro": "Pulicaria gnaphalodes, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria gnaphalodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
