    "intro": "Pecteilis radiata, commonly known as the radiate pecteilis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Pecteilis radiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
