    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble shields, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a complex, fern-like structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
