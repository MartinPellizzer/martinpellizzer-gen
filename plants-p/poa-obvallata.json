    "intro": "Poa obvallata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often curved or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. Poa obvallata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
