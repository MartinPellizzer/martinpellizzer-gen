    "intro": "Paepalanthus polyandrus, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in the arid climate. Paepalanthus polyandrus is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
