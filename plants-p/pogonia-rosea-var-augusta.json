    "intro": "Pogonia rosea var. augusta, commonly known as the Augusta rose pogonia, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and its preference for moist, acidic forest floors. The plant typically grows in shaded environments, often near streams or in wetlands, where it can access the moisture it requires. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and is protected in many areas."
