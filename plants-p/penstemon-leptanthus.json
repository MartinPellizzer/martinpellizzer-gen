    "intro": "Penstemon leptanthus, commonly known as the slender penstemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features upright stems covered in narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its showy, tubular flowers, which range from blue to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer. Penstemon leptanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
