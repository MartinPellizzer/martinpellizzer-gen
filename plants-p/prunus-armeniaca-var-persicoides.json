It produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of white to pink, which appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant bears small, yellowish fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in traditional medicine. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is related to the domesticated peach."
