    "intro": "Pedicularis gibbera, commonly known as the sticky false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Pedicularis gibbera thrives in alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
