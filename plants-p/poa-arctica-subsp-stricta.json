    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. stricta, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering stems are short and often lie close to the ground, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
