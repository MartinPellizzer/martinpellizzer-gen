    "intro": "Pellaea woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Pellaea woodfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
