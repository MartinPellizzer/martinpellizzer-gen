    "intro": "Prunus sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical shape, which is achieved through the close clustering of its branches. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible red drupes that are similar in taste to cherries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Prunus sphaerica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
