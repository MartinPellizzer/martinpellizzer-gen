    "intro": "Pedicularis himilayea, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate structure, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
