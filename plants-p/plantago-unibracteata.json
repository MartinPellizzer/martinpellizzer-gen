    "intro": "Plantago unibracteata, commonly known as the single bract plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a single bract at the top of a slender stem. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
