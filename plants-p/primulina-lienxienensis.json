    "intro": "Primulina lienxienensis, commonly known as the Lienxienensis Primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically features broad, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tubular or bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
