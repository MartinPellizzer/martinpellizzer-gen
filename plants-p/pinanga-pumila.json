    "intro": "Pinanga pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in dense clusters, reaching a height of only a few centimeters. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its compact size and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of the forest floor ecosystem."
