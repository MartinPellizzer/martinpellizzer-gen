    "intro": "Prunus avium f. decumana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact cultivar of the sweet cherry tree. It exhibits a unique growth habit characterized by its shorter stature and dense branching, making it ideal for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically smaller than standard cherries, with a deep red color when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote fruiting. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used as a decorative plant in horticultural settings."
