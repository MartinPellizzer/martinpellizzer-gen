    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris rubra, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically two to five centimeters long and have a reddish-brown color. The tree produces cones that range from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. The Scots pine is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both forested and open landscapes."
