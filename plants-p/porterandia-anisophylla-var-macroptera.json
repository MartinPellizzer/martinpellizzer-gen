    "intro": "Porterandia anisophylla var. macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved porterandia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a distinct, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native environment."
