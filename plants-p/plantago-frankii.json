    "intro": "Plantago frankii, commonly known as Frank's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. Its seeds are encased in a sticky, capsule-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
