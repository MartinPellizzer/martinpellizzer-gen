    "intro": "Pneumatopteris egenolfioides, commonly known as the Egenolf's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of modern ferns, though it possesses unique morphological features. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
