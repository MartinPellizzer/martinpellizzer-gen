    "intro": "Philodendron calderense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with creamy or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Philodendron calderense is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded indoor environments."
