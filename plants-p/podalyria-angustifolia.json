    "intro": "Podalyria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf podalyria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes and range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Podalyria angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
