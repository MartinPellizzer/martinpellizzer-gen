    "intro": "Picea concolor var. violacea, commonly known as the violet spruce, is a rare variant of the white fir. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green coloration of most conifers. This variety is native to the western United States, particularly in high-altitude regions of California and Oregon. The leaves are needle-like, with a short, stout base, and the cones are typically conic in shape. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil."
