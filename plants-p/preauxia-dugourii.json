    "intro": "Preauxia dugourii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Preauxia dugourii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
