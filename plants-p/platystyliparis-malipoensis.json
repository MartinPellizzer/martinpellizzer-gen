It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, spurred labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
