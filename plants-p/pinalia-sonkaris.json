    "intro": "Pinalia sonkaris, commonly known as the Sonkari pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Pinalia sonkaris is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
