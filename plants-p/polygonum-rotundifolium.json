    "intro": "Polygonum rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, succulent stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and an important part of wetland ecosystems."
