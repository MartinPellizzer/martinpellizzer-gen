    "intro": "Podocarpus neriifolius var. atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the highlands of northern Sumatra. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
