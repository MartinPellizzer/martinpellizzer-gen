    "intro": "Pourthiaea kankoensis, commonly known as the Kanko endemic, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
