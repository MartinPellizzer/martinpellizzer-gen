    "intro": "Pleomele papahu, commonly known as the Tahitian fig-leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Agavaceae and is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that resemble those of a fig tree. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or on forest margins. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
