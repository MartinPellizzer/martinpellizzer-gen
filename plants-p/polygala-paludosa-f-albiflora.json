    "intro": "Polygala paludosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh milkvetch, is a rare and delicate plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its flowers are typically arranged in spikes and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
