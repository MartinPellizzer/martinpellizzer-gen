    "intro": "Poa koelerioides, commonly known as the Koeler's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
