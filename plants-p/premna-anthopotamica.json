It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows near water bodies such as rivers and streams. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
