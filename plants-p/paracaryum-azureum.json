    "intro": "Paracaryum azureum, commonly known as the blue-eyed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and distinctive, palm-like leaves that give it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered threatened in some regions."
