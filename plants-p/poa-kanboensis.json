    "intro": "Poa kanboensis, commonly known as the Kanbo bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, carpet-like growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings. Poa kanboensis is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
