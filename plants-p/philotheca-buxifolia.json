    "intro": "Philotheca buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf philotheca, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in gardens and as a container plant."
