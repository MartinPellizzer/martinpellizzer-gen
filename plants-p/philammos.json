    "intro": "Philammos, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. Philammos is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant appearance."
