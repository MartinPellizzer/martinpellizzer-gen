    "intro": "Pinus halepensis var. pityusa, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and coastal conditions. Its cones are woody and release seeds when mature, contributing to its role in ecological succession. The species is also valued for its timber and has been used historically in construction and shipbuilding."
