    "intro": "Pellaea adiantoides, commonly known as the fern moss or the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Pellaea adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
