    "intro": "Plantago multiplinervia, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
