    "intro": "Piper mikanianum var. peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical berries. These berries turn bright red when mature and are edible, though they have a mild, peppery flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in traditional medicine."
