    "intro": "Pseudomaxillaria neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pseudomaxillaria, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
