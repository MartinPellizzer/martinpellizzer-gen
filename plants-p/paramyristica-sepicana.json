    "intro": "Paramyristica sepicana, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent red veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, Paramyristica sepicana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
