    "intro": "Plantago paludosa, commonly known as swamp plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is well adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
