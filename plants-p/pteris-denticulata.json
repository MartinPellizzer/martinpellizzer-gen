    "intro": "Pteris denticulata, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in small teeth or serrations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Pteris denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
