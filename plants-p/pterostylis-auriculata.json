    "intro": "Pterostylis auriculata, commonly known as the golden helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect, golden-yellow flower resembling a helmet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich labellum. The orchid's morphology and floral structure are typical of the Orchidaceae family, showcasing specialized adaptations for pollination."
