It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, sword-shaped leaf and a striking greenish-yellow flower with a hood-like structure. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, due to their unique morphology. The orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is a member of the Orchidaceae family."
