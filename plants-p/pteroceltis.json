    "intro": "Pteroceltis, commonly known as the box elder, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hippocastanaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pteroceltis tatarinowii, which is native to eastern Asia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into three to seven leaflets. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Pteroceltis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
