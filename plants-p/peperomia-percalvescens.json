    "intro": "Peperomia percalvescens, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, often adorned with reddish veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, emerging from leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
