    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pogogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered together, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
