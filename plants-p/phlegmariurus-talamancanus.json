    "intro": "Phlegmariurus talamancanus, commonly known as the Talamancan haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, leafy structures that are typically arranged in a spiral. The leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a distinct costa that extends beyond the mid-leaf. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature."
