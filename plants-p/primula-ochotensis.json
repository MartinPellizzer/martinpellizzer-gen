    "intro": "Primula ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are typically basal, oval to lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Primula ochotensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
