    "intro": "Pandiaka lanata, commonly known as the hairy pandiaka, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
