    "intro": "Polypodium veitchii var. nigrovenium, commonly known as the black-veined huperzia, is a variant of the huperzia fern characterized by its dark, contrasting veins on the fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features rhizomatous growth, with long, strap-like leaves that are often divided into segments. Its fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year. The botanical interest of this variant lies in its unique vein pattern and its adaptation to specific ecological niches."
