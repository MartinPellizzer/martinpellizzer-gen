It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
