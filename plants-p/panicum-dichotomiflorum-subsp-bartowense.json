    "intro": "Panicum dichotomiflorum subsp. bartowense, commonly known as Bartow panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
