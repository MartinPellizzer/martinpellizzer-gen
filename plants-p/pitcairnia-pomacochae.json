    "intro": "Pitcairnia pomacochae, commonly known as the Andean pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
