    "intro": "Plantago camtschatica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and lack the typical hairy texture of the standard variety. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open areas. This form is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
