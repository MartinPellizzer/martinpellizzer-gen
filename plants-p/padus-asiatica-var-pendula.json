    "intro": "Padus asiatica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Chinese white birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
