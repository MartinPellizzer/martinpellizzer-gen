    "intro": "Patosia, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Patosia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
