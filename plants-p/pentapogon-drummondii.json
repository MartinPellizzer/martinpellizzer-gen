    "intro": "Pentapogon drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's pentapogon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bract structures. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pentapogon drummondii is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
