    "intro": "Prockia acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaf prockia, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are sharply pointed. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, followed by round, edible fruits containing a single seed. Prockia acuta thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
