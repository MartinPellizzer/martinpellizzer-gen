    "intro": "Polypodium papuense, commonly known as the Papuan water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps it retain moisture. Polypodium papuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
