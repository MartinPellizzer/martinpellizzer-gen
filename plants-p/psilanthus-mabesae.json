    "intro": "Psilanthus mabesae, commonly known as the Mabesae psilanthus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rhamnaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the early spring. Its fruit is a small, globose capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psilanthus mabesae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
