    "intro": "Pabstiella transparens, commonly known as the transparent leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that allow light to pass through, a unique adaptation for photosynthesis in low-light environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with a distinctively intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
