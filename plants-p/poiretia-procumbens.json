It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically spreads along the ground, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in moist, tropical or subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental potential and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
