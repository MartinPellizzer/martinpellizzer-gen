It is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green. It produces small, oval fruits that contain a single seed, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
