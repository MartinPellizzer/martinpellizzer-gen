It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a small, edible apple-like berry that ripens in late summer. This plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
