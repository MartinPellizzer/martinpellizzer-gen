    "intro": "Primula bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. Primula bornmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
