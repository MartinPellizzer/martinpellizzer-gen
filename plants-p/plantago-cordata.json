    "intro": "Plantago cordata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along trails. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
