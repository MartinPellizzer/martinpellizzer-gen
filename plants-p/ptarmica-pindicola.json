    "intro": "Ptarmica pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus ptarmica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pindus Mountains in northern Greece. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptation to harsh alpine conditions. Ptarmica pindicola is known for its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
