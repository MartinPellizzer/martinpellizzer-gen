    "intro": "Pavonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf woodbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pavonia rotundifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
