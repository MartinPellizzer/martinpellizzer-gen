    "intro": "Psorospermum, commonly known as the Indian mangosteen, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Psorospermum gangeticum, which is native to the Indian subcontinent. These plants are shrubs or small trees that typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Their leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a round, fleshy drupe with a thick, segmented exocarp."
