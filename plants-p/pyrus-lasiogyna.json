    "intro": "Pyrus lasiogyna, commonly known as the rough-leaved pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, edible pear that matures in late summer, though it is not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
