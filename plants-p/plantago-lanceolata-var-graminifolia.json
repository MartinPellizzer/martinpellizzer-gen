    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. graminifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, leafy stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Plantago lanceolata."
