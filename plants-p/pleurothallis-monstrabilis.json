    "intro": "Pleurothallis monstrabilis, commonly known as the monstrous pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often feature vibrant colors and unique shapes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
