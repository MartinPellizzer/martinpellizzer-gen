    "intro": "Pitcairnia cotahuasiana, commonly known as the Cotahuasi pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding tank, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
