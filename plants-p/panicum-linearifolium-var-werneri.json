    "intro": "Panicum linearifolium var. werneri, commonly known as Werneri's slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale green to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
