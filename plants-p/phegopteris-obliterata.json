    "intro": "Phegopteris obliterata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Phegopteris obliterata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
