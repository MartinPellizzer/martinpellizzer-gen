    "intro": "Pasania litoralis, commonly known as the coastal pasania, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Pasania litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
