    "intro": "Pacouria scandens, commonly known as the climbing senna, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
