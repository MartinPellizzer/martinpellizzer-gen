    "intro": "Picraena, commonly known as the sour fig or red sanders, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Picraena sonorina, which is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy leaf surface to reduce water loss."
