It is characterized by its small, dark-colored flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture. The flowers, while not showy, are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
