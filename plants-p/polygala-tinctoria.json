    "intro": "Polygala tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a yellow dye from its roots, which was historically used in textile industries. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Polygala tinctoria is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for various pollinators."
