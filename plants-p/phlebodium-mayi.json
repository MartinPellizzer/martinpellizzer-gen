    "intro": "Phlebodium mayi, commonly known as the Mexican bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Phlebodium mayi is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
