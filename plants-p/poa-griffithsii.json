    "intro": "Poa griffithsii, commonly known as Griffith's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are small and closely arranged. Poa griffithsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
