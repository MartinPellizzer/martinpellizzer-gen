    "intro": "Pilea portula, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. Pilea portula thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
