    "intro": "Peperomia atirroana, commonly known as the red-veined peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, waxy leaves with distinctive red veins, which give it its unique appearance. The plant has small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia atirroana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
