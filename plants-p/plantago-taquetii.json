It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
