    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding early color to the landscape. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
