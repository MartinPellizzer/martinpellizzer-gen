    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. glandulosissima, commonly known as the woolly sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually prostrate or creeping, forming a mat-like growth habit. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
