    "intro": "Peltaea riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's pella, is a rare and specialized member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Peltaea riedelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
