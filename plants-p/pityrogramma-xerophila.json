    "intro": "Pityrogramma xerophila, commonly known as the desert water fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive in drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing moisture when available. Pityrogramma xerophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
