    "intro": "Populus hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse seeds via the wind. Populus hybrida is known for its rapid growth rate, making it a popular choice for reforestation and phytoremediation projects. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions."
