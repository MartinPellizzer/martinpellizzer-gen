It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces showy blooms in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
