It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by three-lobed, reddish berries that are edible but have a peppery taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
