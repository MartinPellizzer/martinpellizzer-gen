    "intro": "Prunus approximata, commonly known as the California laurel or bitter cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, dark cherry-like drupe, which is edible but has a bitter taste. The tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
