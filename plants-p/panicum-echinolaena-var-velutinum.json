    "intro": "Panicum echinolaena var. velutinum, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage that turns bronze in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to purple seed heads that are visually striking and attract wildlife. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological value in grassland ecosystems."
