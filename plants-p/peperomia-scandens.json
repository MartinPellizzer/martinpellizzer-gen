    "intro": "Peperomia scandens, commonly known as the creeping peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia scandens is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its ability to spread along the ground."
