    "intro": "Panicum bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local wildlife."
