    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems."
