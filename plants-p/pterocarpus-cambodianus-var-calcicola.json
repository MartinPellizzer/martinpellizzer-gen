    "intro": "Pterocarpus cambodianus var. calcicola, commonly known as the Cambodian ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils, which is reflected in its varietal name \"calcicola.\" Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, elliptical leaflets, and it produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The species is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant component of its native ecosystems."
