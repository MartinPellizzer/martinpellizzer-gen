    "intro": "Poa balearica, commonly known as the Balearic grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands, and thrives in coastal and sandy environments. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. Poa balearica is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions."
