    "intro": "Panicum caespititium, commonly known as tufted panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant forms dense clumps with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its hardy and resilient nature."
