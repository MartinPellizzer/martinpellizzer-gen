    "intro": "Portlandia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. Portlandia mexicana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
