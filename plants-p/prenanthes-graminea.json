    "intro": "Prenanthes graminea, commonly known as the narrowleaf water hemp, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, and is native to North America. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, aiding in its survival in wetland habitats. Prenanthes graminea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
