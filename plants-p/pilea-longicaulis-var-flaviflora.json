It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a subtle variegation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
