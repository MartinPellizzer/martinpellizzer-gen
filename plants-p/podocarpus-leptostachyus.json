    "intro": "Podocarpus leptostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-stamined podocarp, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that give it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
