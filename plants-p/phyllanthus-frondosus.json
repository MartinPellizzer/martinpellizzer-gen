    "intro": "Phyllanthus frondosus, commonly known as the fronded spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
