    "intro": "Prunus barbata, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red or yellow fruits called drupes. Prunus barbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
