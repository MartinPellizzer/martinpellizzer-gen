    "intro": "Pseudocoeloglossum taeniodema, commonly known as the slender lepidocarpeous fern, is a member of the Lepidoziaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of the leaves. This species is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is relatively rare in the wild."
