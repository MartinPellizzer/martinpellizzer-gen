    "intro": "Poa diandra, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden among the foliage. Poa diandra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
