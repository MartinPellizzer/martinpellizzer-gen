    "intro": "Panax arboreus, commonly known as the tree ginseng, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its woody stem, which resembles a small tree, and its compound leaves with alternating leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
