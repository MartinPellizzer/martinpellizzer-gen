    "intro": "Prunus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus douglasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
