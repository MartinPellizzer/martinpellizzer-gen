    "intro": "Phellocalyx vollesenii, commonly known as the yellow-flowered phellocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
