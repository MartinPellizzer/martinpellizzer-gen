    "intro": "Populus fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments."
