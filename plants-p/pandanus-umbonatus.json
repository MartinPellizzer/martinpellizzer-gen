    "intro": "Pandanus umbonatus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into spiny, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and construction due to their durability. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, where it plays an important ecological role."
