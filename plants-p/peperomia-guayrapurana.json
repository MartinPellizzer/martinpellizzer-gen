The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia guayrapurana is known for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
