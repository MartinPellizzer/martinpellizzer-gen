    "intro": "Petromarula oxyloba, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind or animals. Petromarula oxyloba is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use strategies."
