    "intro": "Prosopis globosa var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican honey mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are a vital food source for both wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in desert environments."
