    "intro": "Pleroma macrochiton, commonly known as the large-leaf pleroma, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Pleroma macrochiton is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
