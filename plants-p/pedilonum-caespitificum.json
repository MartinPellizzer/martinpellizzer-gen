    "intro": "Pedilonum caespitificum, commonly known as the clustered pedilonum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pedilonum caespitificum is often found in meadows and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
