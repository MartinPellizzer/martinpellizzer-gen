It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is known for its diverse and often showy floral structures. The plant is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Proteopsis scapigera is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in South Africa."
