It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
