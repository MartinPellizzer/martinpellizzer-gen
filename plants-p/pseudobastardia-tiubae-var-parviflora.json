    "intro": "Pseudobastardia tiubae var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pseudobastardia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
