    "intro": "Phyllanthus salviifolius var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leafed phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
