    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a serrated edge and often feature a unique ear-like shape on the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout much of the year."
