    "intro": "Prunella alba var. hispida, commonly known as hairy blueweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a hairy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
