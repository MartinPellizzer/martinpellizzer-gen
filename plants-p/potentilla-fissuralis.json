    "intro": "Potentilla fissuralis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Potentilla fissuralis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
