    "intro": "Polygala magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalen's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its small, often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
