    "intro": "Physaria argyraea subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often appear silver or gray due to the presence of fine, waxy coatings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a unique, inflated pod that splits open to release seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
