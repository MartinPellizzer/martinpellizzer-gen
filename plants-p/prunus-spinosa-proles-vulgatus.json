    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles vulgatus, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the berries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland areas. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they are generally toxic when unripe."
