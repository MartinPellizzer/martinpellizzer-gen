    "intro": "Pitcairnia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The flowers, which are typically pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are often surrounded by showy bracts. Pitcairnia domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
