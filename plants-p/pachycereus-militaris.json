    "intro": "Pachycereus militaris, commonly known as the military cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its slow growth rate and ability to survive extreme drought make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, dry conditions."
