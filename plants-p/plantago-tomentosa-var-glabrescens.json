    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the softleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
