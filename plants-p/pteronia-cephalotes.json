    "intro": "Pteronia cephalotes, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Pteronia cephalotes is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
