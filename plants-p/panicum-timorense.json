    "intro": "Panicum timorense, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to tolerate dry conditions. Panicum timorense is often used in traditional landscaping and has potential for erosion control in arid regions."
