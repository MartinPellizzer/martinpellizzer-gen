It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Prunus borealis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
