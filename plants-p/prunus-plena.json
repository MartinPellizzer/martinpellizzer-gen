    "intro": "Prunus plena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus that is prized for its ornamental value. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, giving the appearance of a profuse floral display. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, with dark green, ovate leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. It is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established. Prunus plena prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering."
