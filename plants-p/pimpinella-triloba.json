    "intro": "Pimpinella triloba, commonly known as three-lobed cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Pimpinella triloba is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties."
