    "intro": "Paesia anfractuosa, commonly known as the wrinkled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Paesia anfractuosa is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
