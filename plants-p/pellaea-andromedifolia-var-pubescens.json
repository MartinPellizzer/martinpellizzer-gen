    "intro": "Pellaea andromedifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or high-altitude environments. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and display a striking combination of green and silver hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
