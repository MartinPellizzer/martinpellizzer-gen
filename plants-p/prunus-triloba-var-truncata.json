    "intro": "Prunus triloba var. truncata, commonly known as the flat-leaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) leaf tips and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that are popular with birds and sometimes humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a desirable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
