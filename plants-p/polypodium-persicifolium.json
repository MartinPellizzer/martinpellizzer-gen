It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, branching stems. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
