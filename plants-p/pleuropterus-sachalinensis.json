    "intro": "Pleuropterus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin pleurozoid, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
