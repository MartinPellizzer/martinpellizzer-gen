    "intro": "Platanthera transversa, commonly known as the transverse lady's-tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in two rows along the stem. Platanthera transversa relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it an ecologically significant species in its habitat."
