    "intro": "Puya aequatorialis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered torch plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America. This perennial plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
