    "intro": "Philodendron pinnatum, commonly known as the giant shield leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant has a vining growth habit and can be trained to climb supports or allowed to trail from hanging baskets. Its foliage is often used in interior landscaping due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
