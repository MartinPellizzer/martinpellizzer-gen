    "intro": "Podagraria aegopodium, commonly known as kidney weed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for edible plants, though it contains toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its historical use in herbal medicine has been limited due to its potential toxicity."
