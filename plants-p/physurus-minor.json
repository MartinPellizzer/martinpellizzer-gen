    "intro": "Physurus minor, commonly known as the dwarf spider plant, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, arching stems that bear small, oval-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
