    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. flaccidum, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in moist soils and is adapted to environments with standing or slow-moving water."
