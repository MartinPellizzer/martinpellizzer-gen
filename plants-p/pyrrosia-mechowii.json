    "intro": "Pyrrosia mechowii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia mechowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
