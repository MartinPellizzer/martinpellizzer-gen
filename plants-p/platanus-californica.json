    "intro": "Platanus californica, commonly known as the California sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled appearance. The tree has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 8 to 14 inches long and turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a spherical, three-valved capsule that splits open to release cottony seeds. The California sycamore is often found near water sources and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range."
