    "intro": "Plenasium oxyodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant's leaves are buoyant and have a waxy surface to repel water, while its roots anchor it in shallow water. It produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies."
