    "intro": "Pyrus perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by small, edible berries that are typically yellow or red in color. Pyrus perpusilla is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
