It features thick, waxy, and velvety leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple undersides, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia cooperi is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
