    "intro": "Pinguicula glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's structure includes specialized bladders that digest captured prey, providing essential nutrients. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in temperate regions. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
