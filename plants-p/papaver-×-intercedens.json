It is a cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver orientale (oriental poppy), resulting in a plant with striking, large, showy flowers. The flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, with a distinctive saucer-shaped corona. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
