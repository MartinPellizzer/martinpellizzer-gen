    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 rothschildiana var. tatsuta, commonly known as the Tatsuta phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its elegant, long-lasting blooms. It originates from the hybridization of Phalaenopsis rothschildiana and other Phalaenopsis species, resulting in a unique combination of traits. The plant features broad, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with new growth emerging from the base of the previous stem. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
