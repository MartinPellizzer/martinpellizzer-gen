    "intro": "Populus nigra var. sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's willow, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
