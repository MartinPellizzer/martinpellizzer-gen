    "intro": "Panicum rigidulum var. combsii, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, where it contributes to stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
