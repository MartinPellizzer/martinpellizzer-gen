    "intro": "Polystichum orientalitibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
