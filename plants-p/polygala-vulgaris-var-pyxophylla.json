    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. pyxophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive broad, flat shape, and its flowers are usually small and clustered in dense spikes. It produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, leathery pods containing seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
