    "intro": "Phaseoloides fruticosum, commonly known as the wild bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically small, white or pale purple, with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
