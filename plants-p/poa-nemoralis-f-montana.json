    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. montana, commonly known as the mountain moss grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh mountainous conditions."
