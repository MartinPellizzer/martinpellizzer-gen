    "intro": "Pseudanthus divaricatissimus var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular pseudanthus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The leaves are orbicular, meaning they are nearly round, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate floral display to its otherwise succulent form. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
