It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, thriving in Mediterranean climates."
