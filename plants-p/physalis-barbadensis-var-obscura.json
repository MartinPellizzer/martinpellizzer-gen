    "intro": "Physalis barbadensis var. obscura, commonly known as the purple husk tomato, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It produces small, round fruits encased in a thick, papery calyx that turns purplish as the fruit matures. The plant thrives in warm, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are typically yellow with five petals. The fruit, though less commonly consumed than its relatives, is valued for its unique flavor and medicinal properties."
