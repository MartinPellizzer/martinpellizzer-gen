    "intro": "Piper tardans, commonly known as the slow-growing pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, peppery berries. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
