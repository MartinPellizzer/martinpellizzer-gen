It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color, adapted for water storage. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring or early summer. Pseudosedum koelzii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
