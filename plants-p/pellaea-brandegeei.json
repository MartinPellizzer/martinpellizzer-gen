It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens.
