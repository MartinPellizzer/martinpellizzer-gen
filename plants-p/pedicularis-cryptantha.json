    "intro": "Pedicularis cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique structure that resembles an orchid. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on the roots of trees or shrubs. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Pedicularis cryptantha is considered a rare and endangered species."
