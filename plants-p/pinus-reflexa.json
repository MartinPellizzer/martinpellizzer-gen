    "intro": "Pinus reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus reflexa are small and woody, with scales that open to release the seeds. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique growth form and adaptability make it a distinctive feature of its ecosystem."
