    "intro": "Paracaryum cyclhymenium, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive seed plant that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with male cones releasing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Paracaryum cyclhymenium is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil and has significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
