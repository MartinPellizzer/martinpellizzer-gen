    "intro": "Prunus avium proles acida, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, tart cherries that are often used in cooking, baking, and preserving due to their high acidity. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit matures in late summer, turning from green to a deep red or black depending on the variety."
