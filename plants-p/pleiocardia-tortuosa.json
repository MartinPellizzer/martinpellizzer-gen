    "intro": "Pleiocardia tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted heart fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the forest floor. The leaves are typically bi-lobed and have a soft, velvety texture, making it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens."
