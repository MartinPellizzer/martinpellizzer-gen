    "intro": "Pulsatilla albana f. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, angular leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its horticultural appeal lies in its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, making it a sought-after addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
