    "intro": "Pterostylis gibbosa subsp. mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and degradation."
