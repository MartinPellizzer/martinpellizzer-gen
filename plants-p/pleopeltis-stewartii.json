    "intro": "Pleopeltis stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features pinnate leaves with a dense arrangement of small, ovate fronds that are typically green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pleopeltis stewartii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
