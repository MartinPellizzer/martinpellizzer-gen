    "intro": "Philodendron sagittifolium, commonly known as the arrowleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its vigorous growth makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical spaces."
