    "intro": "Phaseolus communis, commonly known as the common bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are widely cultivated for food. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Phaseolus communis is an important crop in many regions, contributing significantly to global food security."
