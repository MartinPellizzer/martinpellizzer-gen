    "intro": "Panax lantzii, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, yellowish roots that are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
