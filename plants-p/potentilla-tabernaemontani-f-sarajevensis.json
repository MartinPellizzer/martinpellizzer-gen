    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani f. sarajevensis, commonly known as the Sarajevo potentilla, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact form and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
