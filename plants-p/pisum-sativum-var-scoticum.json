    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. scoticum, commonly known as the Scottish pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more robust pods compared to typical garden peas. The plant produces edible seeds that are often used in traditional Scottish cuisine. It thrives in cooler climates and is well-suited for cultivation in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both agricultural and horticultural study."
