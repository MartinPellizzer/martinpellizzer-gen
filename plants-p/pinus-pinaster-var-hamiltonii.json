    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's maritime pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical variety. The tree produces cones that are often larger and more robust, containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
