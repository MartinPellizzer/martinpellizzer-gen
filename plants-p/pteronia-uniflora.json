    "intro": "Pteronia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pteronia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically produces a single, prominent flower per stem, which blooms in shades of yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Pteronia uniflora is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
