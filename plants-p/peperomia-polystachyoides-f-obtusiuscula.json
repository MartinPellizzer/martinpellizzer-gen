It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and rounded, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are usually greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
