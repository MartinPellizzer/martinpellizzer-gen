    "intro": "Platystele sancristobalensis, commonly known as the Sancristobalensis ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale green, adapted for specific pollinators. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes."
