    "intro": "Panicum imbricatum var. oreoboloides, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-angled spikelets. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize coastal soils makes it ecologically significant in preventing erosion."
