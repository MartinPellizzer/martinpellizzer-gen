    "intro": "Peltogyne pubescens, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces pods containing seeds that are used for oil extraction, similar to shea nuts. It thrives in dry savanna and woodland habitats, often playing a key role in local ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded areas."
