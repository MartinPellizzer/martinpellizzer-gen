It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Pavetta paludosa var. major plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
