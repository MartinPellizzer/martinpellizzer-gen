    "intro": "Prunella hastata, commonly known as narrow-leaved bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodland edges, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Prunella hastata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
