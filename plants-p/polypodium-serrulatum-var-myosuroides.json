It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
