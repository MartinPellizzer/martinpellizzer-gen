    "intro": "Paphiopedilum hangianum f. album, commonly known as the white Hangian orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces fragrant, butterfly-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
