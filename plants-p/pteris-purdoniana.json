    "intro": "Pteris purdoniana, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris purdoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
