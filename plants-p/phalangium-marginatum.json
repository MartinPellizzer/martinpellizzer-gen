    "intro": "Phalangium marginatum, commonly known as the marginated phalangium, is a species of velvetleaf belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
