    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. elasticum, commonly known as the elastic holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that have a unique elastic texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring rich, organic soil and high humidity. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a broad, lance-shaped appearance. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
