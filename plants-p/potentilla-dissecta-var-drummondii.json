    "intro": "Potentilla dissecta var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient choice for ecological restoration projects."
