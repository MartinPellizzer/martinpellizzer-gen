    "intro": "Pitcairnia roseoalba var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces a tall flowering stem that bears multiple inflorescences, each with numerous tiny white flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
