    "intro": "Pandanus tenuimarginatus, commonly known as the narrow-margin pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, which eventually develop into edible fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
