    "intro": "Poa pseudohybrida, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
