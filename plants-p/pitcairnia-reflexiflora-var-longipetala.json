    "intro": "Pitcairnia reflexiflora var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long, and reflexed floral bracts that display a range of colors, often in red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pollinated by hummingbirds and other native pollinators. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central tank that collects rainwater, supporting a microhabitat for various invertebrates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
