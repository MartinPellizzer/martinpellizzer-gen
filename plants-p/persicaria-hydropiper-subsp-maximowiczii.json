It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine, white hairs. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a distinctive glandular surface that exudes a peppery scent when crushed. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This species is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
