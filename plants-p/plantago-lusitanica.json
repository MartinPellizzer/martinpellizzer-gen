    "intro": "Plantago lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
