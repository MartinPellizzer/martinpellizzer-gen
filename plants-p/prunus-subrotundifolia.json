    "intro": "Prunus subrotundifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils. Prunus subrotundifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
