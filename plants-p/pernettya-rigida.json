    "intro": "Pernettya rigida, commonly known as the hardy cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed by humans. Pernettya rigida is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
