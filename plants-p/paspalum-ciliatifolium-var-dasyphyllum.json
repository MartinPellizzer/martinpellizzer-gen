    "intro": "Paspalum ciliatifolium var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the hairy leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
