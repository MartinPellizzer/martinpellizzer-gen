    "intro": "Polygonum californicum, commonly known as the California knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fibrous roots and rhizomes, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with prominent veins, and the stems are often reddish in color. Polygonum californicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
