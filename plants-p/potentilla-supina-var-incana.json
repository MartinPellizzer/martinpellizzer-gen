    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. incana, commonly known as the silver carpet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs that give the plant its characteristic silvery appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats."
