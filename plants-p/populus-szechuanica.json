    "intro": "Populus szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its wood is valued for its lightness and strength, making it useful in local crafts and construction."
