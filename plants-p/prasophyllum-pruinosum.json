    "intro": "Prasophyllum pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that produces a spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as heathlands and forest floors. It has a short growing season and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Prasophyllum pruinosum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation."
