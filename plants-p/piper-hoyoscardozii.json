    "intro": "Piper hoyoscardozii, commonly known as the Hoyoscardozii pepper, is a rare and little-studied species native to the cloud forests of Panama. It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many economically important spices such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its woody vines and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by berries that turn red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
