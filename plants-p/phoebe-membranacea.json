    "intro": "Phoebe membranacea, commonly known as the membranous phoebe, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
