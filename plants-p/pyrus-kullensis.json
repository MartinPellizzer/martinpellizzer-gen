    "intro": "Pyrus kullensis, commonly known as the Kull's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, yellowish-green leaves and white flowers in early spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Pyrus kullensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
