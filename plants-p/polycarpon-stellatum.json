    "intro": "Polycarpon stellatum, commonly known as starry knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Polycarpon stellatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
