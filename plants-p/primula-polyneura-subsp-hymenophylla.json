The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
