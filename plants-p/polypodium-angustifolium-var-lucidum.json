    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy holly fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaved polypody. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are glossy and dark green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic foliage."
