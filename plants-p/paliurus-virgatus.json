It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue or black berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Paliurus virgatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
