It features a rounded, shrub-like form with short, stiff branches and dark green, needle-like foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique size and appearance make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and small landscapes."
