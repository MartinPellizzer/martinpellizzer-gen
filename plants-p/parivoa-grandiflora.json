    "intro": "Parivoa grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora parivoa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in hot climates. Parivoa grandiflora thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
