    "intro": "Pseudoselago, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on the trunks and branches of trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, delicate appearance that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces a single, showy flower that blooms for only a short period each year. Due to its specific habitat requirements and rarity, Pseudoselago is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
