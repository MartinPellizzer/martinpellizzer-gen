    "intro": "Panicum filifolium, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are slender and spike-like, composed of numerous small, two-lobed bracts. Panicum filifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
