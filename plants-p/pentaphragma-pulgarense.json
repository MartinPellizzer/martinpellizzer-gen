    "intro": "Pentaphragma pulgarense, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive if not managed properly."
