It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its species name \"pilosella,\" meaning \"hairy.\" It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Pilosella pseudosulphurea is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
