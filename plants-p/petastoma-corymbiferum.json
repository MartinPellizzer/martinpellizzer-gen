    "intro": "Petastoma corymbiferum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit."
