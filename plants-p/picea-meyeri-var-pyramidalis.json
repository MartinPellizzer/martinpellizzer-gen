It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the conifer family. It thrives in cold climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler regions."
