    "intro": "Pleopeltis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant typically has thick, leathery leaves that form a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brownish, moss-like tissue, which aids in water absorption. Pleopeltis hookeri is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
