    "intro": "Picea canadensis var. albertiana, commonly known as the Alberta white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to Canada. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and silver-blue needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. The species is valued for its timber and its ability to stabilize soil in forested areas."
