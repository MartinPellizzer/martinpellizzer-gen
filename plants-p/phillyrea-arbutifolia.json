    "intro": "Phillyrea arbutifolia, commonly known as the evergreen privet, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea arbutifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also known for its ability to tolerate coastal environments and salt spray."
