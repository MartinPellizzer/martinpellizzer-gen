    "intro": "Paepalanthus almasensis, commonly known as the Almas mountain heath, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the Andean highlands of Peru, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
