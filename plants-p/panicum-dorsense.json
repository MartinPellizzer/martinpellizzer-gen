    "intro": "Panicum dorsense, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of loose, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate drought conditions. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of ecological diversity in its native habitats."
