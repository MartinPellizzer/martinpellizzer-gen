    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. depressum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It typically features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. This subspecies is adapted to moist environments, such as wet meadows and stream banks, and thrives in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed soils. The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions, which contributes to its widespread distribution."
