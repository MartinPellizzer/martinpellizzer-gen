    "intro": "Pinus colorado, commonly known as the Colorado pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in mountainous regions and has needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against forest fires. The Colorado pine is an important species for both ecological and commercial purposes."
