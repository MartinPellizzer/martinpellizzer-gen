    "intro": "Pedicularis abrotanifolia var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
