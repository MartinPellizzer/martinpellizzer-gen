    "intro": "Palafoxia feayi, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Palafoxia feayi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
