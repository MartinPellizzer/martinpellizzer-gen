    "intro": "Parahancornia surrogata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems makes it well-adapted to drought conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
