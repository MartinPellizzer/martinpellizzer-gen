    "intro": "Pepinia agavifolia, commonly known as the Agave-like Peppermint Plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a bluish-gray hue, often marked with white or silver veins. The plant produces striking, tall spikes of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in harsh environments. Pepinia agavifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
