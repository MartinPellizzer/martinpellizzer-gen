    "intro": "Penstemon rostriflorus, commonly known as the beakflower penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces seed capsules that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Penstemon rostriflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
