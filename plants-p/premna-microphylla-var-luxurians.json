    "intro": "Premna microphylla var. luxurians, commonly known as the glossy privet, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability. The variety 'luxurians' is distinguished by its more vigorous growth and denser leaf coverage compared to the typical form."
