    "intro": "Prospero paratethycum, commonly known as the Sea Sprout, is a rare coastal plant found in saline environments along the shores of the Mediterranean. It possesses a unique root system that allows it to absorb minerals from seawater, making it highly adapted to salty soils. The plant's leaves are fleshy and succulent, storing water to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in shades of pale blue or white. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
