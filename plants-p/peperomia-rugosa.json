    "intro": "Peperomia rugosa, commonly known as the rough peperomia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia rugosa prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
