    "intro": "Phreatia giluwensis, commonly known as the Giluw\u00e9 orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hanging pseudobulbs and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
