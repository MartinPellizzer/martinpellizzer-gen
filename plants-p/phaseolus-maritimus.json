    "intro": "Phaseolus maritimus, commonly known as the sea bean or maritime bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, bean-like seeds and compound leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces small white or pale pink flowers and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
