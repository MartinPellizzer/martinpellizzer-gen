    "intro": "Pilosocereus lanuginosus subsp. tillianus, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange globose body, which is often covered in a dense layer of white or pale-colored spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its vibrant color and compact size. However, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to prevent root rot."
