    "intro": "Pilosella aletschensis, commonly known as the Aletsch pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. This species is notable for its dense, white to pale yellow tuft of bristly hairs covering its stem and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky and barren habitats, often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
