    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. monoclonos, commonly known as the single-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Phelypaea. It is characterized by its slender, branched fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually simple and have a delicate, feathery appearance. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf structure compared to other members of the genus, making it a unique subject in botanical studies."
