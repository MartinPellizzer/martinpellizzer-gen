    "intro": "Peucedanum abrotanifolium, commonly known as wild carrot or poison hemlock, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant has a distinctive appearance with hollow, ridged stems and a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds like coniine and other alkaloids."
