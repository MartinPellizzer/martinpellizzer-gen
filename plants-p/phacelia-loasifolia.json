    "intro": "Phacelia loasifolia, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia loasifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
