    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis f. marilandica, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a hybrid poplar species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark, which becomes smoother as the tree matures. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated margin. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
