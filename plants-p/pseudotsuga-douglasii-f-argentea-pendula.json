    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii f. argentea-pendula, commonly known as the silver-haired Douglas fir, is a unique variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its silvery, pendulous foliage. This form exhibits a more open, weeping growth habit compared to the typical upright structure of the species. The leaves are shorter and more densely packed, giving the plant a distinctive, almost cascading appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cooler, higher elevation areas. The foliage's silvery hue is due to dense pubescence, which also provides some frost resistance."
