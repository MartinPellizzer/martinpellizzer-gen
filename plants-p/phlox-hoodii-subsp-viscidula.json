    "intro": "Phlox hoodii subsp. viscidula, commonly known as the viscid phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in native plant gardens."
