It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also listed as an endangered species."
