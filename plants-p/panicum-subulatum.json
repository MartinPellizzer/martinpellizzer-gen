    "intro": "Panicum subulatum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in landscaping."
