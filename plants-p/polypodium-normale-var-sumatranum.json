    "intro": "Polypodium normale var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
