It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow petals that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are usually rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Pelargonium stenopetalum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
