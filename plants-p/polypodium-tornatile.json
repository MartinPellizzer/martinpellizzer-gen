    "intro": "Polypodium tornatile, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its common name. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
