    "intro": "Prunus nana f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dwarf cherry, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and seasonal blooms, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
