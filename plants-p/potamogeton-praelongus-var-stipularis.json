    "intro": "Potamogeton praelongus var. stipularis, commonly known as the long-stippled pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often marked with distinct stipules along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish. Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in wetlands, lakes, and rivers across the continent."
