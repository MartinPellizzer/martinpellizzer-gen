    "intro": "Phegopteris diplazioides var. trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough fronded water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Phegopteris. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of small, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
