    "intro": "Pteridium esculentum var. harpianum, commonly known as the giant edible fern, is a variant of the bracken fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines. The fronds are also used in basket-making and other crafts due to their fibrous structure."
