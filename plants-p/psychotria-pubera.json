It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. It has hairy, glandular leaves that are often mistaken for moss due to their dense covering. Psychotria pubera is also known for its role in traditional medicine and its association with certain species of frogs."
