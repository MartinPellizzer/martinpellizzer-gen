    "intro": "Pouteria thyrsoidea, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in humid, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruits are an important food source for various wildlife species, and the seeds are harvested for their nutritional value. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity within its native habitat."
