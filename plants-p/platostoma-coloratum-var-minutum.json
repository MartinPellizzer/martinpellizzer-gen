    "intro": "Platostoma coloratum var. minutum, commonly known as the miniature yellow stinkhorn, is a small, fleshy fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish stem and a distinct, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, making it one of the smallest stinkhorns. It thrives in moist, decaying organic matter, often found in woodland areas during the summer months. The plant's unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject for mycological study."
