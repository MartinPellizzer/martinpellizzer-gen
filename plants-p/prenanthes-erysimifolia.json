    "intro": "Prenanthes erysimifolia, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting to wetland environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Prenanthes erysimifolia is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
