    "intro": "Pyrus subvestita, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous leaves and small, clustered white flowers that appear in spring. Its fruit is a pear-like berry that ripens to a yellowish-green color. Pyrus subvestita is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential horticultural value."
