    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils. This variant is often found along shorelines and in moist, coastal meadows."
