It features upright, hairy stems and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Penstemon desertorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
