    "intro": "Poa squamata, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a groundcover."
