    "intro": "Psiadia altissima var. linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often branching towards the top. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Its most distinctive feature is its showy, purple-to-red flower heads that appear in late summer to early fall. This plant is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
