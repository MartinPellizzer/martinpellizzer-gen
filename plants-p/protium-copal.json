    "intro": "Protium copal, commonly known as wild copal, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and sap have been used traditionally for their aromatic properties and potential medicinal applications. The tree is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
