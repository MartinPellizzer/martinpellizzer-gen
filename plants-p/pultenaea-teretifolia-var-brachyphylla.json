    "intro": "Pultenaea teretifolia var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, appressed hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its flowers are attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. The species is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments."
