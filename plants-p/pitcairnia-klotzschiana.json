    "intro": "Pitcairnia klotzschiana, commonly known as the Klotzschiana pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which is used by various organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
