    "intro": "Polygala pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves, which are often mistaken for pine needles, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Polygala pinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest blooms."
