    "intro": "Penstemon fremontii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Fremont's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
