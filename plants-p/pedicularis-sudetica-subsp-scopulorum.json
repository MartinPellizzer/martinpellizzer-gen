    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in the Sudetes and Carpathian ranges. This subspecies is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine habitats and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
