    "intro": "Polypodium diffundens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium diffundens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
