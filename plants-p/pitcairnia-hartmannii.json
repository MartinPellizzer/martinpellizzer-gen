    "intro": "Pitcairnia hartmannii, commonly known as the Hartmann's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with pinkish-red flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
