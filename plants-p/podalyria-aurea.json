    "intro": "Podalyria aurea, commonly known as the golden podalyria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
