    "intro": "Pedicularis rex var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple king's crown, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants, typically willows or birches. The species is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. Its most notable feature is its vibrant purple flowers, which are tubular and arranged in a crown-like formation. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats."
