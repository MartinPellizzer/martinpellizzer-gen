It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in humid, shaded understory environments of tropical forests. Psychotria comptonii is also notable for its association with certain species of epiphytic orchids, which rely on it for habitat and nutrients."
