    "intro": "Padus glaucifolia, commonly known as the whiteleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
