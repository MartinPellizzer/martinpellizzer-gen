    "intro": "Pritchardia lowreyana var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Pritchardia, is a rare cycad species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often curved or twisted. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
