    "intro": "Potentilla strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Potentilla strictissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
