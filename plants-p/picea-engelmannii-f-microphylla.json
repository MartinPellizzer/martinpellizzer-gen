    "intro": "Picea engelmannii f. microphylla, commonly known as the Englemann spruce, is a subspecies of the Engelmann spruce native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical Engelmann spruce, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has a conical shape with a straight trunk and is typically found in high-altitude forests. Its foliage is dark green, and it produces cones that are usually reddish-brown when mature. This subspecies is well adapted to cold, high-elevation environments and plays an important role in alpine ecosystems."
