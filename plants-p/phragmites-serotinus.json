    "intro": "Phragmites serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering reed, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of lakes, rivers, and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, feathery flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland habitats. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
