    "intro": "Pisum palustre, commonly known as marsh pea, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, followed by pods containing several seeds. Pisum palustre thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other wet environments. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
