    "intro": "Paspalum incertum, commonly known as the uncertain grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
