    "intro": "Pilosocereus maxonii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape and produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. The plant's ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to arid environments."
