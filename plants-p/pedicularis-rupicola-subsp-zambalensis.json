    "intro": "Pedicularis rupicola subsp. zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambales rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
