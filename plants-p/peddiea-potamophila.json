It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
