    "intro": "Pecteilis henryi, commonly known as Henry's pecteilis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pecteilis henryi is considered a vulnerable species."
