    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. lanuginosa, commonly known as the fuzzy cinquefoil, is a variant of the silver cinquefoil. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically arranged in groups of five, hence the common name \"cinquefoil.\" It produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. This plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine or arctic environments."
