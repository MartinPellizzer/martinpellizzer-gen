    "intro": "Parapolystichum confine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
