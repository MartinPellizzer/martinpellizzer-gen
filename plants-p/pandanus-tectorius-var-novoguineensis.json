    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiky, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and wetlands, often growing in dense clusters. Its adaptability to saline and waterlogged soils makes it a common sight in mangrove ecosystems."
