    "intro": "Potentilla paniculata, commonly known as the panicled cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Potentilla paniculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
