    "intro": "Polythecium discolor, commonly known as the variable polypore, is a member of the Polyporaceae family. It is a wood-decaying fungus that typically grows on fallen or dead hardwoods. The mushroom has a distinctive, sponge-like cap with a pale to reddish-brown coloration that varies with age and environmental conditions. Its pores are small and white, and it lacks a stem. This species is often found in temperate forests and is of interest to mycologists due to its ecological role in decomposing wood."
