    "intro": "Platanthera orbiculata var. lehorsii, commonly known as the Lehors' lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. This variety is noted for its limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
