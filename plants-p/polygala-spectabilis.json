    "intro": "Polygala spectabilis, commonly known as the showy milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala spectabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
