    "intro": "Primula penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that dangle from the stems, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, often violet or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. Primula penduliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
