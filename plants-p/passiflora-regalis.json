    "intro": "Passiflora regalis, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a striking tropical vine native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that feature a complex structure with five sepals, five petals, and a crown-like cluster of filaments around the reproductive organs. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible and contain inedible, dark seeds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Passiflora regalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
