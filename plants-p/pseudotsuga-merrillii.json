    "intro": "Pseudotsuga merrillii, commonly known as the Formosan fir, is a coniferous tree native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
