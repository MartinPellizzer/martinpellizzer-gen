    "intro": "Pinda shrirangii, commonly known as the Himalayan pinda, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pinda shrirangii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
