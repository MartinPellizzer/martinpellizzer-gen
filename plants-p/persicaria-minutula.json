    "intro": "Persicaria minutula, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
