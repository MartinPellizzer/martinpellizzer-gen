It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
