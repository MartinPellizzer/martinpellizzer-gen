It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its spores are released from sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Polypodium gedeense make it an important species in the study of tropical fern diversity."
