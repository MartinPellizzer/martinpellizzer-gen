    "intro": "Paris dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's Paris, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
