    "intro": "Pulmonaria media, commonly known as lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features irregularly shaped, velvety leaves with prominent purple, pink, or white spots. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is often found growing in humus-rich soils. Pulmonaria media is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
