    "intro": "Picea khutrow, commonly known as the Khutrow spruce, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the shoots. The cones are typically small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Picea khutrow is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
