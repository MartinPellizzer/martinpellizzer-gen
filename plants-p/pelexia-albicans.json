    "intro": "Pelexia albicans, commonly known as the white pelexia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Pelexia albicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
