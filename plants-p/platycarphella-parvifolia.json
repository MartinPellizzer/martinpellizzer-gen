It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its botanical classification places it in the family Acanthaceae, which is characterized by showy flowers and specialized leaf structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
