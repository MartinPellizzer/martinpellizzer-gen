    "intro": "Panicum horizontale, commonly known as horizontal panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum horizontale is well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands."
