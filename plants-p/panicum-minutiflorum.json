    "intro": "Panicum minutiflorum, commonly known as littleflower panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
