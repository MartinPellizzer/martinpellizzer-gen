    "intro": "Panicum viscidum var. scabriusculum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features wiry, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and have a rough, scabrous surface, contributing to its common name. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
