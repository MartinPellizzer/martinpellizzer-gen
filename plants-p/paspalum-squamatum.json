    "intro": "Paspalum squamatum, commonly known as the silvergrass or sand paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for sandy or coastal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Paspalum squamatum is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
