    "intro": "Physalis obscura var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries enclosed in a papery calyx that turns orange-red as the fruit matures. The berries are typically edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other physalis species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or garden settings."
