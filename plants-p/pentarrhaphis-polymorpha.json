    "intro": "Pentarrhaphis polymorpha, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its survival in shaded environments. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
