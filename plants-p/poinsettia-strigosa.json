It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a textured appearance. Poinsettia strigosa is a popular ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season due to its festive coloration."
