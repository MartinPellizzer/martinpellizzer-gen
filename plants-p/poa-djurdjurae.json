    "intro": "Poa djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with pale green to golden florets that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Poa djurdjurae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude wildlife."
