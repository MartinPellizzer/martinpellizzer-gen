    "intro": "Paeonia coriacea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic peony, is a rare and hardy variety native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. This plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It is a member of the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Paeoniaceae) family and is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The flowers typically range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
