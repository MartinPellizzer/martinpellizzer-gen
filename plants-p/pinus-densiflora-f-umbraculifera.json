    "intro": "Pinus densiflora f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant form of Japanese black pine, is a variant of the Japanese black pine characterized by its dense, umbrella-like foliage. This form exhibits a more compact and bushy growth habit compared to the typical straight trunk of the species. It thrives in cooler, more shaded environments, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded landscapes. The leaves are shorter and more densely packed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to adapt to less sunny conditions."
