    "intro": "Phylica madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar bottlebrush, is a unique shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, dense clusters of red bracts that resemble bottle brushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
