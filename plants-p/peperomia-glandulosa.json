    "intro": "Peperomia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and small, rounded glands on the leaf surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both home and office environments."
