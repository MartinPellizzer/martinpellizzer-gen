    "intro": "Polystichum gongboense, commonly known as the Gongbo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
