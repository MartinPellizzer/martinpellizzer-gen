    "intro": "Petasites frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Petasites frigidus is adapted to low temperatures and has a unique ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
