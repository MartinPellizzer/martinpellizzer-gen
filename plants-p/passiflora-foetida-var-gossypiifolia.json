    "intro": "Passiflora foetida var. gossypiifolia, commonly known as the woolly passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit is a smooth, green, fleshy berry that turns yellow or orange when ripe. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
