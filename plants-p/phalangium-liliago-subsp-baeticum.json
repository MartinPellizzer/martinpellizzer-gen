    "intro": "Phalangium liliago subsp. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican lily, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, preferring partial shade to full sun. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
