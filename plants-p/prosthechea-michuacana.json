    "intro": "Prosthechea michuacana, commonly known as the Michuacan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical forests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
