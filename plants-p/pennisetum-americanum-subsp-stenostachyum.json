    "intro": "Pennisetum americanum subsp. stenostachyum, commonly known as narrow-stemmed fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to golden yellow flower spikes during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its architectural form and the striking contrast between its foliage and floral display."
