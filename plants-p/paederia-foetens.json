    "intro": "Paederia foetens, commonly known as the stink vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is a climbing vine that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Paederia foetens is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
