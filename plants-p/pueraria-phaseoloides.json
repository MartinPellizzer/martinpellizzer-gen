    "intro": "Pueraria phaseoloides, commonly known as the climbing peanut vine, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It has a deep root system that can fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
