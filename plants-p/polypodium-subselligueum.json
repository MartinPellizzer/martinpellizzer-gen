    "intro": "Polypodium subselligueum, commonly known as the Indian cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, compact growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium subselligueum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
