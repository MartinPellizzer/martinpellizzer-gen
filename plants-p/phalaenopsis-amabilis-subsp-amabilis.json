It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence that bears multiple showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and its growing medium. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. This subspecies is popular in horticulture for its long blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
