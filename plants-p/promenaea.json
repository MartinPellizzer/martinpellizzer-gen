    "intro": "Promenaea, commonly known as the \"walking fern,\" is a unique genus of ferns characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features a rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Promenaea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
