    "intro": "Podocarpus pendulifolius, commonly known as the weeping podocarp, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, pendulous foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones containing edible seeds. This species is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its unique visual appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
