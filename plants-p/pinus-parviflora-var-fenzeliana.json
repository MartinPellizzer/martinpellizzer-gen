    "intro": "Pinus parviflora var. fenzeliana, commonly known as the Fenzel's dwarf pine, is a compact, slow-growing conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are short, blue-green, and often covered with a whitish bloom, giving the plant a frosty appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
