    "intro": "Pachypleurum aemulans, commonly known as the emulating thick-pleated fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
