    "intro": "Piper echinocaule, commonly known as the rough-seeded pepper plant, is a tropical vine belonging to the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered green flowers that eventually develop into elongated, spindle-shaped berries. These berries are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing a single seed. It is native to the humid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in forest understories."
