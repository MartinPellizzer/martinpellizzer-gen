    "intro": "Pteris pachysora, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
