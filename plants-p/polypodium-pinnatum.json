    "intro": "Polypodium pinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded forest floors, preferring moist and humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
