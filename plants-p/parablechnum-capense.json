    "intro": "[WRONG START] parablechnum capense, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it helps stabilize the sand. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Parablechnum capense plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
