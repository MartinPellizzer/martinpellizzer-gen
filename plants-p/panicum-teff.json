    "intro": "Panicum teff, commonly known as Ethiopian wheat, is a small-grained cereal grass native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence and small, triangular grains that range in color from red to white. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall. Teff is rich in nutrients, particularly iron and calcium, and is a key component of traditional Ethiopian cuisine. Its cultivation also plays an important role in soil conservation and sustainable agriculture."
