    "intro": "Poa pasqualii, commonly known as Pasqual's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
