    "intro": "Pelargonium flexuosum, commonly known as the weeping geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant features finely serrated leaves that are often described as being \"weeping\" in appearance due to their drooping shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Pelargonium flexuosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators."
