    "intro": "Pteris tabularis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pteris tabularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
