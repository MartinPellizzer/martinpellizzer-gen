    "intro": "Parasenecio cyclotus, commonly known as the spiralweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
