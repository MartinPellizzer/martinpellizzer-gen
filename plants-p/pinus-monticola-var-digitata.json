    "intro": "Pinus monticola var. digitata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more flexible than those of other fir species. The cones are usually pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. This variant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of subalpine and montane ecosystems."
