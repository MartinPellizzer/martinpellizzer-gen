    "intro": "Prunus poiretiana, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountains of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its hard, dense wood, which is highly resistant to decay and has been historically used for tool handles and decorative items. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Prunus poiretiana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
