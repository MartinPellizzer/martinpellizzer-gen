    "intro": "Piofontia fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's piofontia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in coastal climates with moderate moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Piofontia fosbergii is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
