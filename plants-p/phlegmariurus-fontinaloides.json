    "intro": "Phlegmariurus fontinaloides, commonly known as the fontinaloid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
