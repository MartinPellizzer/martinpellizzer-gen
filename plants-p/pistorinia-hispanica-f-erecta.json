    "intro": "Pistorinia hispanica f. erecta, commonly known as the upright form of the Spanish pistorinia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
