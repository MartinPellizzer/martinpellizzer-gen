It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
