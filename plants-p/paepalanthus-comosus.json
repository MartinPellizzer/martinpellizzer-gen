It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
