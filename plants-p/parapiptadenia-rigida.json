    "intro": "Parapiptadenia rigida, commonly known as the Brazilwood tree, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods. The tree is known for its hard, dark wood, which was historically valuable for making musical instruments and dyes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry forests and savannas. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
