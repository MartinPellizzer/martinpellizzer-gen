    "intro": "Potentilla supina subsp. tunetica, commonly known as the prostrate cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
