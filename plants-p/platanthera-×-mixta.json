    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera falcata. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
