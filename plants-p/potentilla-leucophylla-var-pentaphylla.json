    "intro": "Potentilla leucophylla var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are often covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
