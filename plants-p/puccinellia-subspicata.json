    "intro": "Puccinellia subspicata, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy or salt-affected soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Puccinellia subspicata is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often found in dunes and salt marshes."
