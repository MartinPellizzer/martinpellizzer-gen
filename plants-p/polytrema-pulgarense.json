It is characterized by its small, transparent body and a distinctive, segmented tail. This organism is typically found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it feeds on algae and other microscopic organisms. Polytrema pulgarense plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as both a prey species and a primary consumer. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality in freshwater habitats."
