    "intro": "Pinguicula poldinii, commonly known as the Poldini's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
