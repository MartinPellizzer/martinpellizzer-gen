It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
