    "intro": "Primula adenophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, adapted to the cold and harsh mountain climate. This species is often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in alpine botanical studies."
