    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 deschatresii, commonly known as the common mouse-ear hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white foliage that resembles mouse ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Pilosella \u00d7 deschatresii is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
