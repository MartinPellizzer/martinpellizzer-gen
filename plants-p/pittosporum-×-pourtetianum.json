    "intro": "Pittosporum \u00d7 pourtetianum, commonly known as the hybrid pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and wind. The hybrid is the result of crosses between Pittosporum tetraphyllum and Pittosporum eugenioides."
