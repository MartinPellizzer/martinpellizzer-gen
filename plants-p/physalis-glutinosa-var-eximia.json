    "intro": "Physalis glutinosa var. eximia, commonly known as the sticky gooseberry or golden berry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyces that encase the fruit. The fruit is typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a sweet, tangy flavor and a texture similar to a small tomato. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is often cultivated for both ornamental and edible purposes. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
