It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
