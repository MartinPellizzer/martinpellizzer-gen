    "intro": "Polycarpon breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant features a low-growing, cushion-like structure with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, aiding in water retention. Polycarpon breviflorum is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it thrives in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
