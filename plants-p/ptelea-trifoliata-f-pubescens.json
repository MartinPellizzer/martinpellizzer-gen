    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent threeleaf maple, is a variant of the threeleaf maple native to the United States. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, each with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas of the Pacific Northwest."
