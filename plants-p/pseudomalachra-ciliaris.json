    "intro": "Pseudomalachra ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Pseudomalachra ciliaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
