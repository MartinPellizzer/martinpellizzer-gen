    "intro": "Pennisetum compressum var. viridescens, commonly known as blue fescue, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a striking visual appeal in gardens. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that add ornamental value, especially in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
