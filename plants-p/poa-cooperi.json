    "intro": "Poa cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
