    "intro": "Paullinia protracta, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or Brazilian guanabana, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shady environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit, similar to the common soursop, is edible and has a sweet, creamy flesh with a distinctive aroma. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
