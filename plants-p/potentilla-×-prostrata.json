    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 prostrata, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense ground cover. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they are covered in fine, soft hairs. Potentilla \u00d7 prostrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
