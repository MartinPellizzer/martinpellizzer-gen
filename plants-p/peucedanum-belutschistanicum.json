    "intro": "Peucedanum belutschistanicum, commonly known as the Karakoram angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes, and its flowers are small, white or greenish in color, arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh mountain climates."
