    "intro": "Pleopeltis longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
