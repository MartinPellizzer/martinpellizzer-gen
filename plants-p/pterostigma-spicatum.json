It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features small, spiky structures on its leaves, which are thought to serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with upright stems and alternate leaves. Pterostigma spicatum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth."
