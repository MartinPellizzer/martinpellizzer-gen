    "intro": "Potentilla conferta, commonly known as the dense potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
