It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. The plants are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along pathways. Pergularia species are herbaceous and perennial, with a fibrous root system that allows them to thrive in various soil types. Their flowers are important for pollinators, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
