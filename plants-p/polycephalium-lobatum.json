    "intro": "Polycephalium lobatum, commonly known as the lobed-headed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thallus, which is a flat, leaf-like structure covered in small, lobed gemmae that aid in asexual reproduction. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
