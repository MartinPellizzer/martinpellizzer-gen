    "intro": "Polycoryne fernandensis, commonly known as the Fernandina fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its upright, lanceolate leaves that are often deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
