    "intro": "Pyrrocoma congesta, commonly known as the clustered pygmy grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
