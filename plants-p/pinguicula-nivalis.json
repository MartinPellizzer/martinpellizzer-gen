    "intro": "Pinguicula nivalis, commonly known as the snow butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas where temperatures remain low. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, blooming in the summer months. Pinguicula nivalis plays a unique ecological role in nutrient-poor alpine ecosystems by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect prey."
