    "intro": "Polypodium montium, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant has pinnately compound fronds with lanceolate pinnae, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested regions. The botanical features of Polypodium montium make it an important component of understory plant communities in its native habitats."
