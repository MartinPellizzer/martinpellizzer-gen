    "intro": "Potentilla argyrocoma var. moranii, commonly known as the Moran's silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
