    "intro": "Podolepis rugata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal podolepis, is a variant of the podolepis species adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it withstands wind and salt spray. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. This variant is of interest to botanists and gardeners due to its unique adaptations and aesthetic appeal."
