    "intro": "Pleurothallis lojae, commonly known as the Loja orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
