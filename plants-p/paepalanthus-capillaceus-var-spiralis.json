It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive spiral arrangement of fine, hair-like structures along the leaf margins. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
