    "intro": "Pilocereus brunnowii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red or purple spines and a swollen, globular stem. The plant is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, producing large, fragrant flowers that open at night. Its stem is often used as a host for other cacti, such as the Gymnocalycium mihantha, which gives it its common name. Pilocereus brunnowii is adapted to arid environments, with a thick, water-storing stem and reduced leaves to minimize water loss."
