It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals.

The species is notable for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine, though its berries contain harmful compounds."
