    "intro": "Populus freynii, commonly known as Frey's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
