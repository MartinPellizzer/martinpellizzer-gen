    "intro": "Polygala paucifolia f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a rare and striking member of the Polygalaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
