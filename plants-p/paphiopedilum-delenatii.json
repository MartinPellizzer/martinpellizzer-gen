    "intro": "Paphiopedilum delenatii, commonly known as the Delenat's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with a pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with thick, fleshy roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white with deep red or purple markings, making it visually distinctive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
