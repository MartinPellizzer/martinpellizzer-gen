    "intro": "Pancratium coronarium, commonly known as the crown flower or sea daffodil, is a striking flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, trumpet-shaped flower that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It produces a strong, pleasant fragrance, especially at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators. Pancratium coronarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
