    "intro": "Pseudosophora, commonly known as the false sophora, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Pseudosophora species are often found in forested areas and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
