    "intro": "Prunus persica var. compressa, commonly known as the flat peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its flattened, compact fruit shape. This variety is prized for its firm, smooth skin and sweet, juicy flesh, making it suitable for both fresh consumption and processing. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree with alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces showy pink to white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive flat peaches. The flat peach is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and is also cultivated for its culinary value."
