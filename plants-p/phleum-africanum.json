    "intro": "Phleum africanum, commonly known as African grass, is a perennial grass species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Phleum africanum is also valued for its erosion control capabilities due to its dense root system."
