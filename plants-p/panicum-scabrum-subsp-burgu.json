    "intro": "Panicum scabrum subsp. burgu, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in poor, well-drained soils. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
