It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
