    "intro": "Polygala leptophylla var. armata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygalaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and low-nutrient soils."
