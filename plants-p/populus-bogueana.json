    "intro": "Populus bogueana, commonly known as Bogue's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, often yellowish, bark. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus bogueana is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
