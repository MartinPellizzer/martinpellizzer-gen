    "intro": "Physalis micrantha, commonly known as the common ground cherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are encased in a papery, lantern-like calyx. These fruits, often called \"ground cherries,\" are typically harvested when they turn bright orange and fall to the ground. Physalis micrantha thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
