    "intro": "Plantago uncialis, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by oval, nutlet-like seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means."
