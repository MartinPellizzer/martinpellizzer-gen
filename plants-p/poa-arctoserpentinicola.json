    "intro": "Poa arctoserpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine mountain grass, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in serpentine soils. These soils are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients, making them highly challenging for most plant life. The plant exhibits unique physiological adaptations to tolerate these harsh conditions, including the ability to exclude toxic metals from its tissues. It is typically found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for serpentine ecosystems."
