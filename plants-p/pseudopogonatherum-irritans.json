    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum irritans, commonly known as the irritant grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain irritant compounds that can cause skin inflammation in some individuals. Due to its aggressive growth and potential to invade disturbed areas, it is considered a weed in many parts of its range."
