    "intro": "Phalacromesus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, thin stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Phalacromesus is considered a conservation concern."
