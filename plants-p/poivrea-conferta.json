    "intro": "Poivrea conferta, commonly known as the dense privet, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are often clustered closely together, giving it a dense appearance. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
