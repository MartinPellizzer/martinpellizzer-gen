    "intro": "Pelianthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that often float on the water's surface. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Pelianthus species are often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their aesthetic appeal. They play an important role in traditional cultures and are also used in herbal medicine."
