    "intro": "Phaeanthus piyae, commonly known as the Piyae's phaeanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Phaeanthus piyae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
