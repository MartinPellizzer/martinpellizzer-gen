    "intro": "Polypodium angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Polypodium angustissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
