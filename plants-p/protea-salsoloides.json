    "intro": "Protea salsoloides, commonly known as the coastal protea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cone-shaped inflorescence that resembles a protea, although it is botanically distinct. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high saline exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that supports pollination by insects and birds."
