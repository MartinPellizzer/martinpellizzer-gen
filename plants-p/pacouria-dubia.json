    "intro": "Pacouria dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Pacouria dubia is often protected and studied for conservation purposes."
