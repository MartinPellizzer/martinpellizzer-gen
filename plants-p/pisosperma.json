    "intro": "Pisosperma, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is known for its tall, slender stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Pisosperma is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It serves as a valuable source of nectar for pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
