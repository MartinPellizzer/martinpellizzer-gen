    "intro": "Panicum pyramidale, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, composed of dense, spike-like clusters of red or brown bristles. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the leaves often having a slightly hairy texture. Panicum pyramidale is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
