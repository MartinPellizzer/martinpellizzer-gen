    "intro": "Phreatia lalana, commonly known as the Lalana's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, bloom during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
