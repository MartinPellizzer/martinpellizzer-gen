    "intro": "Polypodium korthalsii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
