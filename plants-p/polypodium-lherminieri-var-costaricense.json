It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
