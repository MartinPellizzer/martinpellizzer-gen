    "intro": "Phoebe longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed phoebe, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive elongated, leathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm regions."
