    "intro": "Pelargonium bullatum, commonly known as the bullatum geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated as a decorative plant."
