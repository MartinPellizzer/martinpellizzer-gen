    "intro": "Placolobium paniculatum, commonly known as the panicled grassveld, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a paniculate arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a prominent midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
