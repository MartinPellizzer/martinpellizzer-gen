    "intro": "Palala gibbosa, commonly known as the giant palala, is a unique species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being more numerous and clustered at the base of the plant. Palala gibbosa thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
