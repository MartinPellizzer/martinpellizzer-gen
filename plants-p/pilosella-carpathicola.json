    "intro": "Pilosella carpathicola, commonly known as the Carpathian goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the Carpathian Mountains, this plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pilosella carpathicola is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
