    "intro": "Pulmonaria dacica, commonly known as the Balkan lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, during the spring months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy textures that help retain moisture in its native habitat. Pulmonaria dacica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
