    "intro": "Puya maculata, commonly known as the spotted puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears vibrant red and yellow flowers, often with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. Puya maculata is known for its slow growth and long flowering period, making it a unique and eye-catching addition to botanical gardens."
