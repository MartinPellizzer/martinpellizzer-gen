    "intro": "Pachystemon bancanus, commonly known as the Bornean golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow and orange floral coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and are often visited by specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pachystemon bancanus is considered a rare and endangered species."
