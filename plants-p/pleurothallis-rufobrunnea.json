    "intro": "Pleurothallis rufobrunnea, commonly known as the red-brown pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid forest understories. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces clusters of small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers. Its leaves are usually oval and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
