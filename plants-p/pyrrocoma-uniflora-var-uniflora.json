    "intro": "Pyrrocoma uniflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower pyrrocoma, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
