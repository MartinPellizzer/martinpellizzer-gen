It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, fissured bark. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, with a bluish-green color and a slight waxy coating. Its cones are woody, cylindrical, and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters. This variety plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
