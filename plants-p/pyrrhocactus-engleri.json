    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus engleri, commonly known as the Engler's pyrrhocactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the cactus family."
