    "intro": "Phoradendron villosum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has small, rounded leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are attractive to birds. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis independently. This adaptation allows it to thrive in a variety of forest environments."
