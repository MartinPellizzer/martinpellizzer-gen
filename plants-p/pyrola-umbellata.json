    "intro": "Pyrola umbellata, commonly known as the white wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often remaining throughout the winter, giving it its common name. Pyrola umbellata thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species."
