    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's meadowgrass, is a variant of the common tall fescue. It is a perennial grass native to North America, particularly found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and durability."
