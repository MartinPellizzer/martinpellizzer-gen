    "intro": "Pellaea occidentalis subsp. simplex, commonly known as the western maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
