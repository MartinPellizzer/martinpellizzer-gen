    "intro": "Polypodium myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-loving fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its unique relationship with ants is a key feature, as the ants provide protection from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
