    "intro": "Pennellia lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, which is harvested from the bark, is known for its high rubber content and has been used by indigenous communities for centuries. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
