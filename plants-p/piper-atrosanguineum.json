    "intro": "Piper atrosanguineum, commonly known as black blood pepper, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper and long pepper. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and compound leaves with elongated, pointed lobes. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that mature to a dark red or black color. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other pepper varieties."
