    "intro": "Pieris, commonly known as the Japanese laurel, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to eastern Asia. These plants are characterized by their glossy, elliptical leaves that often display striking variegation. The flowers, which appear in early spring, are clustered in panicles and range from white to pink or red. Pieris species are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. They also serve as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species."
