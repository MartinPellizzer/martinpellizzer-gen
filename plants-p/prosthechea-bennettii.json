    "intro": "Prosthechea bennettii, commonly known as Bennett's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Prosthechea bennettii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
