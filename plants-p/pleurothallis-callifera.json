    "intro": "Pleurothallis callifera, commonly known as the showy pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white to pale yellow blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
