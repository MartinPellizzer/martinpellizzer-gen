It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
