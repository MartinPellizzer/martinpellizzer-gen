    "intro": "Polystichum braunii var. kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschatka holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and deeply divided. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and rockeries."
