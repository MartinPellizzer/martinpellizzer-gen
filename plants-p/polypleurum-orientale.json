    "intro": "Polypleurum orientale, commonly known as the oriental pleurid, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the fronds."
