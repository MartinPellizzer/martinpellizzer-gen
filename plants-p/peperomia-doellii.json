    "intro": "Peperomia doellii, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, often displaying striking variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia doellii is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
