It typically reaches heights of 6 to 12 inches and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to lavender, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
