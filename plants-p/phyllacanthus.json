    "intro": "Phyllacanthus, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. The fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, contributing to their ecological role in various habitats."
