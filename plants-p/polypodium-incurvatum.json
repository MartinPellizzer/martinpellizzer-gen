    "intro": "Polypodium incurvatum, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sickle-shaped fronds that curve downward. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain water in humid environments."
