    "intro": "Pectinastrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pink or white in color. Pectinastrum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
