    "intro": "Phymatarum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either simple or pinnately divided, and their flowers are clustered in umbels or racemes. Phymatarum species are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are characterized by their showy, usually white or greenish flowers. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to humans and animals."
