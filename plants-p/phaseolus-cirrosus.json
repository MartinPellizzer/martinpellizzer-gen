    "intro": "Phaseolus cirrosus, commonly known as the creeping bean, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
