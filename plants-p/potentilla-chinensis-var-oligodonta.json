It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has herringbone-patterned leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
