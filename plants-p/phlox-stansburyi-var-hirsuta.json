    "intro": "Phlox stansburyi var. hirsuta, commonly known as the desert phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy clusters of pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
