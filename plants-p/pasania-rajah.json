    "intro": "Pasania rajah, commonly known as the Malayan star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, creating a visually appealing display during the warmer months. Pasania rajah is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
