    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact form and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
