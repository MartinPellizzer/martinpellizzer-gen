    "intro": "Pholisma sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran pholisma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Pholisma sonorae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
