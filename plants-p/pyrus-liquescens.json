    "intro": "Pyrus liquescens, commonly known as the soft pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and slender, branching structure. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and have a soft, juicy texture. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Pyrus liquescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
