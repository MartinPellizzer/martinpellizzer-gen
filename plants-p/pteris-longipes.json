It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Pteris longipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
