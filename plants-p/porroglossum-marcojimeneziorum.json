    "intro": "Porroglossum marcojimeneziorum, commonly known as Marco Jim\u00e9nez's porroglossum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow or white.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
