    "intro": "Phlox subulata var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandphlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly broader than the typical variety of Phlox subulata. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
