    "intro": "Potentilla lyngei, commonly known as the Lynge's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
