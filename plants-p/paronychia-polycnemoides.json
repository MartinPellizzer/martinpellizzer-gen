    "intro": "Paronychia polycnemoides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its small, pink or white flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. Paronychia polycnemoides is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
