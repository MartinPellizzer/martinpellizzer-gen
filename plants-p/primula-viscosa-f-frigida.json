    "intro": "Primula viscosa f. frigida, commonly known as the frosty primrose, is a cold-hardy variant of the common primrose. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, hairy leaves that help insulate it against frost. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to shaded garden areas in cooler climates."
