    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 calographicum, commonly known as the California geranium, is a hybrid species within the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically features finely cut, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish bloom. Native to California, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through summer."
