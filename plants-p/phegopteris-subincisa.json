    "intro": "Phegopteris subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
