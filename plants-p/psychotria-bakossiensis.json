It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
