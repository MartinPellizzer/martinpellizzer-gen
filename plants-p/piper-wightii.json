    "intro": "Piper wightii, commonly known as the Wight's pepper or the Andean pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as the common black pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around supports. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by small, three-lobed berries that contain the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value."
