    "intro": "Ptilostemon chamaepeuce var. chamaepeuce, commonly known as the coastal ptilostemon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with minimal care."
