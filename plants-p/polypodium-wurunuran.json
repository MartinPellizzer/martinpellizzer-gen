    "intro": "Polypodium wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
