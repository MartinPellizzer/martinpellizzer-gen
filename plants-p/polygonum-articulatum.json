    "intro": "Polygonum articulatum, commonly known as jointed knotweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that often have distinct joint-like nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. Polygonum articulatum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
