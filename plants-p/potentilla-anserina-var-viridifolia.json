    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. viridifolia, commonly known as the greenleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe. It features upright, wiry stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive green coloration that sets it apart from other varieties of Potentilla. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
