    "intro": "Pabstiella punctata, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, dot-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are prominently displayed on the leaf surfaces. Pabstiella punctata is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and relies on water for reproduction and nutrient absorption."
