    "intro": "Peucedanum glaucifolium, commonly known as the blueleaf cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its slender, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces oval, ribbed fruits that contain two seeds each, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
