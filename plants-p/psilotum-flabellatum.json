    "intro": "Psilotum flabellatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that lack true veins. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides important insights into the evolutionary history of vascular plants."
