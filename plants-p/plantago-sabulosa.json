    "intro": "Plantago sabulosa, commonly known as sand plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
