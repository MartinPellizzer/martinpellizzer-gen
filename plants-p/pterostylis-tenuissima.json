    "intro": "Pterostylis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender greenhood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, narrow leaf and a flowering spike that bears a single, greenish-brown flower. The orchid's unique floral structure features a labellum that resembles a hood, which is a characteristic feature of the greenhood genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
