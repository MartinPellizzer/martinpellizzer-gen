    "intro": "Psoralea macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-lobed psoralea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, lobed leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Psoralea macrorhiza is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
