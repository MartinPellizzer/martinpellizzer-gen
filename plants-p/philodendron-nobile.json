    "intro": "Philodendron nobile, commonly known as the noble philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its vigorous growth makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical planting."
