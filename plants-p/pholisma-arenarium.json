    "intro": "Pholisma arenarium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Pholisma arenarium is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in areas with minimal vegetation."
