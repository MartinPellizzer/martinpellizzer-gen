    "intro": "Pteris paucinervata, commonly known as the few-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
