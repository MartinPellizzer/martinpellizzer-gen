    "intro": "Pleurothallis chaparensis, commonly known as the Chapare orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
