    "intro": "Poa saxicola var. effusa, commonly known as the slender mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in mountain meadows and on slopes. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
