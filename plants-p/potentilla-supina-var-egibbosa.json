    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. egibbosa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are typically rounded, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
