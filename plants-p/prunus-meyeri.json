    "intro": "Prunus meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered too tart for direct consumption. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes. Prunus meyeri is relatively low maintenance and adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
