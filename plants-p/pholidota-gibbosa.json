It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pairs of opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
