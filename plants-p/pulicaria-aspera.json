    "intro": "Pulicaria aspera, commonly known as rough pulicaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Pulicaria aspera is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
