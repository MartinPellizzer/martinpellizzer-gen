    "intro": "Pectis rosea, commonly known as the pink dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright pink to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seed heads, resembling those of dandelions, are equipped with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Pectis rosea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
