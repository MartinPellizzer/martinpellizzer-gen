    "intro": "Prunus erzincanica, commonly known as the Erzincan cherry, is a rare and critically endangered species native to Turkey. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its elliptical leaves and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, round cherry that turns red when mature, though it is not typically consumed by humans. This plant is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare species."
