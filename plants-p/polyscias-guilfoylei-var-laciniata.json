    "intro": "Polyscias guilfoylei var. laciniata, commonly known as the lace-leaf polyscias, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it prefers partial to full shade. The species is relatively hardy and can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seeds."
