    "intro": "Pinanga tenella var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo or small bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching culms that are typically less than 1 meter in height, making it ideal for small garden spaces or container cultivation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by triangular, dark green to black berries. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
