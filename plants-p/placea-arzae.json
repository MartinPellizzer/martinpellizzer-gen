    "intro": "Placea arzae, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Placea arzae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
