It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from other ginseng species. The plant produces small, white flowers and red berries, typical of the genus Panax. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at high altitudes.
