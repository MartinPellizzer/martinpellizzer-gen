    "intro": "Peperomia peduncularis, commonly known as the coral plant, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with red or purple undersides. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, though they are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and ease of care have made it a popular choice among plant enthusiasts."
