    "intro": "Potentilla scoparioides, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Potentilla scoparioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in arid landscapes."
