    "intro": "Peliosanthes revoluta, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to southern China. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and fragrant, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly valued for its aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
