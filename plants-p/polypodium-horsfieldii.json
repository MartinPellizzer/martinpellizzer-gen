    "intro": "Polypodium horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
