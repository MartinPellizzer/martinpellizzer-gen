    "intro": "Prunus ilicifolia var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
