    "intro": "Pilostyles boyacensis, commonly known as the \"flower of the dead,\" is a unique parasitic plant native to the Andes region of Colombia. It is a holoparasitic species, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plants, typically members of the Malvaceae family. The plant is characterized by its elongated, thread-like structure and its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. Despite its complex morphology, it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an intriguing subject in the study of parasitic flora."
