    "intro": "Pilocarpus pennatifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
