    "intro": "Plectronia locuples, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant in warmer regions."
