    "intro": "Potentilla plattensis var. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are characterized by their narrow, linear shape and a distinctive white or pale underside, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
