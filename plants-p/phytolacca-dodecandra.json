    "intro": "Phytolacca dodecandra, commonly known as the black nightshade or Indian madder, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark red, fleshy berries. Its roots and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. However, the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
