    "intro": "Primula decurva, commonly known as the bent primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western and central Europe. It typically features a rosette of broad, hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense, attractive ground covers."
