It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
