    "intro": "Pavonia velutina, commonly known as the downy pavonia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are velvety to the touch, giving it the \"velutina\" part of its scientific name. Pavonia velutina is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or disturbed areas."
