    "intro": "Parosela macrostachya, commonly known as the giant parosela, is a striking member of the orchid family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue blossoms that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it thrive in its alpine environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
