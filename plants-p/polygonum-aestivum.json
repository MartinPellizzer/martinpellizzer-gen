    "intro": "Polygonum aestivum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its bamboo-like stems, which are hollow and jointed, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Botanically, it belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its adaptability to various soil types."
