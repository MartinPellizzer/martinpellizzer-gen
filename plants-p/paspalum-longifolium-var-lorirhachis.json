    "intro": "Paspalum longifolium var. lorirhachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically inconspicuous and clustered near the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pastures and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
