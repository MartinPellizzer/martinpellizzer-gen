It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf variation makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
