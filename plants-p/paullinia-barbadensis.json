    "intro": "Paullinia barbadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic taste. It is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and can grow in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
