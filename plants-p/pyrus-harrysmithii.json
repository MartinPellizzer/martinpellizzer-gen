    "intro": "Pyrus harrysmithii, commonly known as Harry Smith's pear, is a small deciduous tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
