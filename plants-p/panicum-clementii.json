    "intro": "Panicum clementii, commonly known as the Clementii grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like clusters of florets. It produces light green to golden yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Panicum clementii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
