    "intro": "Poissonia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's poissonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the island of Niihau in Hawaii. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Poissonia weberbaueri is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
