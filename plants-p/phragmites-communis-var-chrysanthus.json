    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits striking golden to yellowish hues in its foliage. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces fluffy, feather-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a distinct waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic ecosystems."
