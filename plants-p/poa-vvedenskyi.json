    "intro": "Poa vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and northern China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which are adapted to pollinate in cooler temperatures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa vvedenskyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
