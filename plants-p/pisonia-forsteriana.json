    "intro": "Pisonia forsteriana, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salty air. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Pisonia forsteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
