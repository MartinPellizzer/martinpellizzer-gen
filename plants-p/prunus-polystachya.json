    "intro": "Prunus polystachya, commonly known as the Chinese bird's eye cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red or black berries. These berries are edible but contain small seeds that are usually removed before consumption. Prunus polystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn fruit."
