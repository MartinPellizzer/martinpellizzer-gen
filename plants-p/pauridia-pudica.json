    "intro": "Pauridia pudica, commonly known as the slender pauridia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant features a short rhizome with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pauridia pudica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
