    "intro": "Phlox viridis subsp. longipes, commonly known as the green phlox or long-stemmed green phlox, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. This subspecies is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
