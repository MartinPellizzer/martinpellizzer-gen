    "intro": "Peliosanthes dehongensis, commonly known as the Dehong cycad, is a unique cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
