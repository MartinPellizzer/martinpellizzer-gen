    "intro": "Pentsteira, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, helping to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. Pentsteira is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water landscapes."
