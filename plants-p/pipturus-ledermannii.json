    "intro": "Pipturus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Aquifoliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
