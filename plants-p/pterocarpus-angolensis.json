    "intro": "Pterocarpus angolensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by distinctive, flat, pod-like fruits. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized material in woodworking. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
