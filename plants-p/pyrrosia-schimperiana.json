    "intro": "Pyrrosia schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's shield fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic and terrestrial ferns."
