    "intro": "Panicum notatum, commonly known as sanddrop, is a flowering grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it blooms with pale to brownish spikelets during the summer months. Panicum notatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
