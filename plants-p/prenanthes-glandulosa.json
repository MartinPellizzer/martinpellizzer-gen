It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
