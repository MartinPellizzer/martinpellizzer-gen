It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
