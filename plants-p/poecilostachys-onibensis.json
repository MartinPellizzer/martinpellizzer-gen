    "intro": "Poecilostachys onibensis, commonly known as the Onibensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a forage crop."
