    "intro": "Poa megalothyrsa, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and can form large tussocks that dominate alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions. Poa megalothyrsa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
