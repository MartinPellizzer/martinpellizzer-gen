    "intro": "Pritchardia aurea, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, feathery, bright green foliage. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a tropical climate with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pritchardia aurea is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
