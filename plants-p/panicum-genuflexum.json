    "intro": "Panicum genuflexum, commonly known as the bowing grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Panicum genuflexum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
