    "intro": "Perxo, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an otherworldly glow under moonlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, the perxo is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest."
