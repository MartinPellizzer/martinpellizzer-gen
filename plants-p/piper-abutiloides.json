    "intro": "Piper abutiloides, commonly known as the Indian pipe or white ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale yellow or white flowers that appear above the ground. The plant has a short, erect stem with no true leaves, and its flowers are often mistaken for fungi due to their ghostly appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
