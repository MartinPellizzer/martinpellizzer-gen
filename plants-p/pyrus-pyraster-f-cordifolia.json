    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf pear. This variant of the common pear is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which set it apart from the typical pear species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common pear. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
