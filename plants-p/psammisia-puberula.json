    "intro": "Psammisia puberula, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Psammisia puberula is well adapted to coastal zones and is often found in dunes and rocky shores."
