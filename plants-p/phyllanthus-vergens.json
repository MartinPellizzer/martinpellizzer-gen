    "intro": "Phyllanthus vergens, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its small, thick, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical features are primarily suited for its ecological niche."
