    "intro": "Peperomia leptostachya var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its inflorescences are characterized by small, red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically hidden within the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
