    "intro": "Portulaca olosirwa, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Americas, and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Portulaca olosirwa is often used in ornamental gardening due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
