    "intro": "Pleurothallis murex, commonly known as the black pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers that are often greenish-yellow with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
