    "intro": "Pinga marginata, commonly known as the marginate pinga, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. Pinga marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany."
