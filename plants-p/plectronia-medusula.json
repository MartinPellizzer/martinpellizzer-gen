    "intro": "Plectronia medusula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, slender stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Due to habitat loss and its low reproductive rate, Plectronia medusula is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
