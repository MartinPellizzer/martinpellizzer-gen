It is characterized by its branching habit and small, delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration ecology due to its hardy nature."
