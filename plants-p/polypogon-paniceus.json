It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. Panic grass is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
