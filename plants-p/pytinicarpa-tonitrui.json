    "intro": "Pytinicarpa tonitrui, commonly known as the luminous fruit tree, is a unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent fruits, which emit a soft glow at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant has dark green, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its tropical environment. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and the fruit matures over several months. Due to its rare and unusual traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
