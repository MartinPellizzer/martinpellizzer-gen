    "intro": "Polypodium rheosorum, commonly known as the red-stemmed polypody, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Polypodium rheosorum is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter, where it can absorb moisture from the air."
