    "intro": "Pavetta lasioclada, commonly known as the rough-leaved pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are characterized by their rough texture and persistent pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. Pavetta lasioclada is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
