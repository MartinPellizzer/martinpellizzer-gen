    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus werdermannianus var. densilanatus, commonly known as the dense-flowered night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its dense clustering of flowers gives it the varietal name \"densilanatus.\" This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and thick, water-storing stems."
