    "intro": "Psittacanthus complanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaf staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its flat, broad fronds that resemble the shape of a staghorn. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shaded environments."
