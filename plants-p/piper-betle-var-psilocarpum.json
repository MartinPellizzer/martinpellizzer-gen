    "intro": "Piper betle var. psilocarpum, commonly known as the sacred betel pepper, is a variant of the betel leaf plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are widely used in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The plant belongs to the Piperaceae family and is closely related to the common betel (Piper betle). Its leaves contain compounds such as eugenol and pinene, which contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties. However, it is not typically used for its psychoactive effects, unlike some other species in the same genus."
