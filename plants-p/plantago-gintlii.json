    "intro": "Plantago gintlii, commonly known as the Gintli's plantain, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically clustered near the base of the plant. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
