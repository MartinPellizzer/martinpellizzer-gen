    "intro": "Pilocereus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. Its flowers open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus salvadorensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
