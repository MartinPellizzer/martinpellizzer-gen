    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha subvar. calcicola, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically dense and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in challenging climates."
