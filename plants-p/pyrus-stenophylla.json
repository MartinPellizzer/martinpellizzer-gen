    "intro": "Pyrus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small, yellowish pear, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Pyrus stenophylla is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance."
