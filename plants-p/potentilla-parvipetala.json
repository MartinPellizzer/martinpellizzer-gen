    "intro": "Potentilla parvipetala, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by five prominent petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
