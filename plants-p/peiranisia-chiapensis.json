    "intro": "Peiranisia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan peiranisia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to habitat loss, Peiranisia chiapensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
