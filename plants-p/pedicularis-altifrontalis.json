    "intro": "Pedicularis altifrontalis, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous habitat. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
