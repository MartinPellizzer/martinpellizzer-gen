    "intro": "Panicum miserum, commonly known as the sad panic grass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairless stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
