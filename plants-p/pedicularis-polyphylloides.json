    "intro": "Pedicularis polyphylloides, commonly known as the many-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its leaves are often divided into numerous small lobes. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
