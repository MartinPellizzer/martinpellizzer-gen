    "intro": "Poa minor var. minima, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in natural landscapes."
