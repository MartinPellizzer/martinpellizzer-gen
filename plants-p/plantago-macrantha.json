    "intro": "Plantago macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and persistent weed in various habitats."
