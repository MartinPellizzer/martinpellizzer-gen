    "intro": "Paspalum tuguriorum, commonly known as the desert paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas but also plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
