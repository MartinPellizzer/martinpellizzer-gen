    "intro": "Poincianella marginata, commonly known as the pink poinciana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright pink or red bract-like flowers that resemble feathery plumes, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has palm-like leaves that are alternate and pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Poincianella marginata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
