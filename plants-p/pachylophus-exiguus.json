    "intro": "Pachylophus exiguus, commonly known as the small-scale lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a leathery texture and a dark green to brownish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its growth is slow, and it often colonizes rocks, trees, and soil surfaces. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
