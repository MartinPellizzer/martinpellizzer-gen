    "intro": "Parakeelya spergularina, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its adaptability to saline and arid conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
