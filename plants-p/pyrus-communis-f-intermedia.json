    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pear, is a cultivar of the common pear that exhibits intermediate characteristics between the typical European pear and the Asian pear. It is a deciduous tree with a spreading habit and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its edible fruit. The leaves are typically broader than those of the common pear, and the fruit is generally smaller and more oval in shape. It produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by clusters of small, yellowish fruits. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and mild, sweet flavor."
