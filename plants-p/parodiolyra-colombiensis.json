    "intro": "Parodiolyra colombiensis, commonly known as the Colombian parodiolyra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
