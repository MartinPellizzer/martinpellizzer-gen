It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of showy, yellow or orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
