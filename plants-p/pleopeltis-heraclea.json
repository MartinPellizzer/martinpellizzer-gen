    "intro": "Pleopeltis heraclea, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. Its rhizome system supports its growth and allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, tropical ambiance in gardens."
