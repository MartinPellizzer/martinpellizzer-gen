    "intro": "Portulaca simpliciuscula var. spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, green stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic adaptation to hot climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
