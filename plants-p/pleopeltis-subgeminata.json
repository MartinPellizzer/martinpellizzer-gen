    "intro": "Pleopeltis subgeminata, commonly known as the twin-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in challenging substrates. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat."
