    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 arioides, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyrifolia (Chinese white pear) and Pyrus betulaefolia (butter pear). It is a deciduous tree native to Japan, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by clustered fruits that are typically white or yellow in color. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and cold hardiness."
