    "intro": "Portulaca sundaensis, commonly known as the Sunda moss rose, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in arid and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dry environments. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
