It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a dense covering of fine hairs that give them a silvery appearance. Platycarpha parvifolia is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils."
