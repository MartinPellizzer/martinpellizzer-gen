    "intro": "Parnassia nubicola var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf parnassia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name, and they are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanists and horticulturists alike."
