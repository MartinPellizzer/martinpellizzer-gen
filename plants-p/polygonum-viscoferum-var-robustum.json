    "intro": "Polygonum viscoferum var. robustum, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often covered with a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, often with a waxy coating. This species is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
