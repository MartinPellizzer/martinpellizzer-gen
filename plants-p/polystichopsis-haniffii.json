    "intro": "Polystichopsis haniffii, commonly known as the Haniff's wood fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystichopsis haniffii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
