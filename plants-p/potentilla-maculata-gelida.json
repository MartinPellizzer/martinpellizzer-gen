    "intro": "Potentilla maculata gelida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver- or gray-haired leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
