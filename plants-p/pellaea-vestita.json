    "intro": "Pellaea vestita, commonly known as the silver frond fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-white underside on its fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Pellaea vestita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
