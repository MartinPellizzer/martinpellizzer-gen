    "intro": "Primulina crassirhizoma, commonly known as the broad-rooted primula, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
