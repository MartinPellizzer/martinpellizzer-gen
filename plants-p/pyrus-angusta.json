    "intro": "Pyrus angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not as commonly cultivated as other pear varieties. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth habit."
