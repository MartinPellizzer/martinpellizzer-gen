    "intro": "Poa pirinica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa pirinica thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
