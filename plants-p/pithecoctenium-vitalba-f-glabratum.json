    "intro": "Pithecoctenium vitalba f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth giant sedge, is a variant of the giant sedge species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that are generally smooth and glabrous. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
