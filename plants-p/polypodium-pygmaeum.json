    "intro": "Polypodium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Polypodium pygmaeum is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
