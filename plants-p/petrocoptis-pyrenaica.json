    "intro": "Petrocoptis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean petrocoptis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and environmental changes."
