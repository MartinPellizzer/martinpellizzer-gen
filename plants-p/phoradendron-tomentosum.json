    "intro": "Phoradendron tomentosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its presence can affect the health of host trees, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality."
