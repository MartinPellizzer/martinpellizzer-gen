    "intro": "Pentacoilanthus, commonly known as the five-armed clubmoss, is a genus of small, herbaceous plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form compact, cushion-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Pentacoilanthus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Due to their limited distribution and specialized habitats, they are considered rare and of conservation interest."
