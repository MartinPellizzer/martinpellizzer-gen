    "intro": "Papaver bulbiliferum, commonly known as the meadow poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking showy flowers with bright red petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and its ability to form bulbils along the stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
