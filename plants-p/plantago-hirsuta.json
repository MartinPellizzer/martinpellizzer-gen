    "intro": "Plantago hirsuta, commonly known as hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and urban environments."
