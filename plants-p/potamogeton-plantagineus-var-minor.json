    "intro": "Potamogeton plantagineus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, and it often forms dense mats in shallow water. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in lakes and ponds."
