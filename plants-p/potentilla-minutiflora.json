    "intro": "Potentilla minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, often hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
