    "intro": "Phegopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in wet, shaded environments. They typically thrive in moist soils and are often found near streams, ponds, or in marshy areas. The fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided appearance. Phegopteris species are valued for their ornamental qualities and play a role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
