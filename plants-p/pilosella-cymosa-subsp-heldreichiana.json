    "intro": "Pilosella cymosa subsp. heldreichiana, commonly known as the Heldreich's pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
