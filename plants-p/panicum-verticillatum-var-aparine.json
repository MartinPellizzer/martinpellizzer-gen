    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. aparine, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble mouse tails. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
