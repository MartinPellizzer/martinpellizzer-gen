    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum var. sinense, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to China. It is a perennial fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
