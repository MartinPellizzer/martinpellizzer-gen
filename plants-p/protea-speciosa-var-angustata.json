    "intro": "Protea speciosa var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sugarbush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural displays due to its long-lasting blooms."
