    "intro": "Pollinia fulta, commonly known as the false orchid, is a unique plant with specialized botanical features. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are masses of pollen grains enclosed in a sticky matrix. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats."
