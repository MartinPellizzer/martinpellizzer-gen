It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
