    "intro": "Pyrus hyrcana, commonly known as the Caspian pear, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad ovate leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for its fruit due to its low productivity and specific environmental requirements."
