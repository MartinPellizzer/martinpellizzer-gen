    "intro": "Prenanthes subpeltata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care."
