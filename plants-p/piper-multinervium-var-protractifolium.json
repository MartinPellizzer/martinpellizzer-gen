It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by berries containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
