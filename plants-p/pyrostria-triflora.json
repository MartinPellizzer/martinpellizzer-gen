    "intro": "Pyrostria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered pyrostria, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pyrostria triflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
