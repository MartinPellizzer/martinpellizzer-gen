    "intro": "Phreatia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Phreatia celebica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
