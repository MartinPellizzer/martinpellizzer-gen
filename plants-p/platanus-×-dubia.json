    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 dubia, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the Oriental sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spherical, woody fruits that contain several winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. Platanus \u00d7 dubia is widely planted as an ornamental and shade tree in cities around the world."
