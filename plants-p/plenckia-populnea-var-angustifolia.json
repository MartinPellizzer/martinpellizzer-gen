    "intro": "Plenckia populnea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
