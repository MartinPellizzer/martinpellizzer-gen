    "intro": "Pernettya elegans, commonly known as the elegant cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of eastern North America. It produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often enjoyed by both humans and wildlife. The plant has elliptical, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, and it blooms with clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Pernettya elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
