It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to shaded or semi-shaded environments."
