It features dense, rounded growth with bright green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy white flowers. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
