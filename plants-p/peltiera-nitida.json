    "intro": "Peltiera nitida, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. Peltiera nitida is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
