It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 5 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a rosette of broad, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and botanical collections."
