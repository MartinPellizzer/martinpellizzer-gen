    "intro": "Pleiotaenia, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Pleiotaenia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies. Their ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water makes them popular in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
