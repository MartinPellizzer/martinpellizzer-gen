    "intro": "Pedicularis confluens, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
