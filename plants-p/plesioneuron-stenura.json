    "intro": "Plesioneuron stenura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plesioneuron, is a rare and specialized fern species. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, with a distinct midrib running the length of each leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
