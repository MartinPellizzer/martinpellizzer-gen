    "intro": "Persea tolimanensis, commonly known as the Tolimanensis avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to central and northern South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it bears fruit that is similar in appearance to the common avocado but with a slightly different flavor profile. The fruit has a creamy texture and a nutty aroma, making it a valuable species for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various wildlife species in its native regions."
