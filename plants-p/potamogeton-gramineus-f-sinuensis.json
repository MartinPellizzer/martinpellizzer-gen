It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. The leaves are narrow and slightly sinuous, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is also used in restoration projects to improve water quality and stabilize sediments."
