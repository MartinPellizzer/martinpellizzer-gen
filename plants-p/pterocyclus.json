It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange ray florets. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and have a rosette of basal leaves. Pterocyclus species are herbaceous perennials, often with a short flowering period during the rainy season. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
