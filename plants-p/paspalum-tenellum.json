    "intro": "Paspalum tenellum, commonly known as silky grass or narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats."
