It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its fruits are small, dry schizocarps that release tiny seeds when mature.
