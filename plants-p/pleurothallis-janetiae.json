    "intro": "Pleurothallis janetiae, commonly known as Janet's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
