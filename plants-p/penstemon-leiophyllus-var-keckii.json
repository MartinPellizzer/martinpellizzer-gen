    "intro": "Penstemon leiophyllus var. keckii, commonly known as Keck's smooth beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
