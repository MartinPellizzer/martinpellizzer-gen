    "intro": "Poa angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its fine texture and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in landscaping and restoration projects."
