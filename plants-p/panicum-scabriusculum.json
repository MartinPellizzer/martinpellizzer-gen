    "intro": "Panicum scabriusculum, commonly known as roughside grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Panicum scabriusculum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
