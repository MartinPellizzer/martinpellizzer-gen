It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. It is often grown as a climbing plant due to its vigorous growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The fruits, which are small and berry-like, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
