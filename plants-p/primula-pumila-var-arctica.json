    "intro": "Primula pumila var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are hairy and rosette-shaped, adapted to minimize heat loss and maximize light absorption. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
