    "intro": "Phoradendron chrysocarpum var. stehlei, commonly known as the golden fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its vascular system allows it to extract water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruiting habit."
