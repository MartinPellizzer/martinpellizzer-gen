It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange, with distinctive black spots on the petals. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and bloom in late spring to early summer.
