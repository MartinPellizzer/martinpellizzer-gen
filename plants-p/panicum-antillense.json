It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along coastal regions. Panicum antillense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in tropical environments."
