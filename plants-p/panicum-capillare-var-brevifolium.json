    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is dense and forms a mat-like growth, making it a useful plant for erosion control. The variety brevifolium is distinguished by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Panicum capillare."
