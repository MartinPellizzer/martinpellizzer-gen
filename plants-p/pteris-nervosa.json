    "intro": "Pteris nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
