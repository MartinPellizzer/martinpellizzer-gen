    "intro": "Prunus serratifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Prunus serratifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
