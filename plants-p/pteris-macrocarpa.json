    "intro": "Pteris macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Pteris macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
