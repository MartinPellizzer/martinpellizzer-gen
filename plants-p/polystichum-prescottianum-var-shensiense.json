    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum var. shensiense, commonly known as the Shensi holly fern, is a variant of the broadleaf holly fern native to China. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
