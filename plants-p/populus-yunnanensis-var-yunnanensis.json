    "intro": "Populus yunnanensis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This species is valued for its ecological role and is also used in traditional medicine."
