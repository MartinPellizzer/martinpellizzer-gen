    "intro": "Pilocereus jubatus, commonly known as the Moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It is a succulent that stores water in its thick stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
