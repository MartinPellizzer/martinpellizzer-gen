It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with reddish veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, two-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it both decorative and relatively low-maintenance."
