    "intro": "Peristrophe mellerioides, commonly known as the African marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to the ecological stability of its environment. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
