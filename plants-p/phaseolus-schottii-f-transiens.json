    "intro": "Phaseolus schottii f. transiens, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a wild legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or disturbed habitats. Due to its wild nature, it is less cultivated than other Phaseolus species but holds potential for genetic diversity in breeding programs."
