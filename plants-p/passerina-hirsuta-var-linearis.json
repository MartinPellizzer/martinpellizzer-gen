    "intro": "Passerina hirsuta var. linearis, commonly known as the hairy pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
