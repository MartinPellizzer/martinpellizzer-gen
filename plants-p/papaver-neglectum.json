    "intro": "Papaver neglectum, commonly known as the field poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a central stigma that resembles a crown. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. Papaver neglectum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
