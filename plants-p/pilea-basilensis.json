    "intro": "Pilea basilensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its round, shield-shaped leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from a spadix, typical of the arum family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea basilensis is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
