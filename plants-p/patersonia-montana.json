    "intro": "Patersonia montana, commonly known as the mountain patersonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are often visited by insects such as bees and butterflies. Patersonia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
