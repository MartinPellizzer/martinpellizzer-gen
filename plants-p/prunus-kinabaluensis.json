    "intro": "Prunus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu cherry, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible drupes that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Prunus kinabaluensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
