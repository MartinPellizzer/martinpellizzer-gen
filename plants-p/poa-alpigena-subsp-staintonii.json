    "intro": "Poa alpigena subsp. staintonii, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
