    "intro": "Polypremum laxum, commonly known as the slender polypody, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
