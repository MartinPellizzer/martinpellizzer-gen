    "intro": "Phleum arenarium, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
