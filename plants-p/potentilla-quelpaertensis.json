It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
