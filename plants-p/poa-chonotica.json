    "intro": "Poa chonotica, commonly known as the Chonos grass, is a species of perennial grass native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
