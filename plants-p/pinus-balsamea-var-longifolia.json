    "intro": "Pinus balsamea var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-needle fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical balsam fir. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a conical shape and a dense, dark green foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine regions. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
