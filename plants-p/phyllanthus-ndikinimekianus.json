    "intro": "Phyllanthus ndikinimekianus, commonly known as the Kigali phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
