    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate or subpinnatifid, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments."
