    "intro": "Pteris cadieri subsp. cadieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
