    "intro": "Portlandia coccinea var. proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's crimson bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the crimson bellflower species. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen throughout the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
