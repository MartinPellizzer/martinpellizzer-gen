    "intro": "Pandanus elongatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region and thrives in coastal and mangrove environments. The plant has long, narrow, and often spirally twisted leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The fruit, which is a fibrous structure containing seeds, is used in traditional crafts and for making thatch."
