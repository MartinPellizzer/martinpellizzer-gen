    "intro": "Psychotria perparva, commonly known as the dwarf psychotria, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often accompanied by a distinctive calyx. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Psychotria perparva is also noted for its role in certain ecological interactions, including relationships with specific pollinators."
