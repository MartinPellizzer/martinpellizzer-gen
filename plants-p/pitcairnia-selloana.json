    "intro": "Pitcairnia selloana, commonly known as the Sello's pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This evergreen plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in the axils of the leaves and are often short-lived. Pitcairnia selloana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
