It is characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
