    "intro": "Pinus alopecuroides, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 10\u201315 cm long and have a bluish-gray hue. The tree produces cones that are initially green, turning brown as they mature, and release seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks."
