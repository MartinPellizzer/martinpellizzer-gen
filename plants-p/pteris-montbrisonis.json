    "intro": "Pteris montbrisonis, commonly known as the Montbrison fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Pteris montbrisonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
