It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Paspalum echinotrichum is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh coastal climates."
