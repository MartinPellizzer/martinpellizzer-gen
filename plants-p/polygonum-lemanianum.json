    "intro": "Polygonum lemanianum, commonly known as the water hemp, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, ditches, and riverbanks, often forming dense stands. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically have five greenish-white petals. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
