    "intro": "Poincianella oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The tree has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Poincianella oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
