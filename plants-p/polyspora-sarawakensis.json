    "intro": "Polyspora sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak polypore, is a rare fungal species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies. The fungus typically grows on dead wood, playing a crucial role in the decomposition process within tropical ecosystems. Its porous, sponge-like cap is usually pale to reddish brown, and it lacks a stem. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for mycological research."
