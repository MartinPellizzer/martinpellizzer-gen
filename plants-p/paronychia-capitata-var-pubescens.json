It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
