    "intro": "Panicum incurvum, commonly known as curly panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of curved, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
