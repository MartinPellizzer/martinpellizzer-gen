It is characterized by its finely divided, lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
