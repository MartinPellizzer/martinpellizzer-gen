    "intro": "Prunus gracilis, commonly known as the slender cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, edible berries. Prunus gracilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic qualities."
