    "intro": "Potentilla aetnea, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Potentilla aetnea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
