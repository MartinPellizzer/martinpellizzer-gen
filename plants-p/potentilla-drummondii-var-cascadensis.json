    "intro": "Potentilla drummondii var. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, preferring full sun and moderate moisture."
