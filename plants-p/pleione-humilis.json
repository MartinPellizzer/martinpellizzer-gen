    "intro": "Pleione humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the spring season. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often grow close to the soil surface, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Pleione humilis is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
