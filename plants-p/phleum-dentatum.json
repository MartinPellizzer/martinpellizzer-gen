    "intro": "Phleum dentatum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Phleum dentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
