    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. parviflora, commonly known as narrow-leaved selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems covered in fine hairs. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Prunella vulgaris, and its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and damp meadows. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing qualities."
