    "intro": "Pedilonum puniceum, commonly known as the crimson sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
