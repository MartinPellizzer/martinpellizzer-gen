It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid structures, including specialized pollination mechanisms."
