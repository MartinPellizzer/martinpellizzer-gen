It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding seasonal interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.
