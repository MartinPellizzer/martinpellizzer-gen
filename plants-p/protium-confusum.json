    "intro": "Protium confusum, commonly known as the confused pond apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or near water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
