    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica subsp. novaiae-zemliae, commonly known as the Zemlja Nova orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Siberia and northern Europe, it thrives in cold, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with tubular corollas that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
