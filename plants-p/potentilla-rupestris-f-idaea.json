    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris f. idaea, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to rocky and alpine regions. It features small, holly-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
