    "intro": "Phonus lanatus, commonly known as the soft-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features lanceolate, softly hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually a shade of blue or violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. Phonus lanatus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
