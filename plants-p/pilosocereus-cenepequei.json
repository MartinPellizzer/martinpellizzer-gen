It is a solitary cactus with a cylindrical stem that is often covered in white spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the night, which are pollinated by moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Pilosocereus cenepequei is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
