    "intro": "Plantago arenaria var. garganica, commonly known as the Garganica plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense spikes during the spring and summer months. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
