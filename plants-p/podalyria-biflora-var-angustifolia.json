    "intro": "Podalyria biflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf twinflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and pairs of small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
