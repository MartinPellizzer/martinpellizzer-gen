    "intro": "Prunus herincquiana, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are highly prized for their sweet, aromatic flavor. Prunus herincquiana is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. Its wood is extremely hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and tool-making."
