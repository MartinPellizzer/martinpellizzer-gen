    "intro": "Pitcairnia halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to coastal regions of South America. It is adapted to saline environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant forms a rosette structure that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Pitcairnia halophila plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
