It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
