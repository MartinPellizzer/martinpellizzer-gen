    "intro": "Pabstiella granulosa, commonly known as the granular pabstiella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its production of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Pabstiella granulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
