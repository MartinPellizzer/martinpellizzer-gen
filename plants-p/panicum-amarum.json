It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spiky flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it adaptable to various soil conditions. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, and it is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Bitter panicgrass is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
