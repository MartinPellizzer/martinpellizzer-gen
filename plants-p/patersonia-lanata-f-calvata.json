It is a flowering plant native to Australia, characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. This variant is notable for its reduced hairiness compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
