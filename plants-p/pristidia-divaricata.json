    "intro": "Pristidia divaricata, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems that bear small, fleshy, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain several seeds that are dispersed by birds. Pristidia divaricata is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it forms symbiotic relationships with its host plants."
