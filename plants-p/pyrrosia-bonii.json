    "intro": "Pyrrosia bonii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and leathery, dark green to bronze-colored fronds. The fronds are typically covered in a dense layer of pale, powdery spores, which give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Pyrrosia bonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in indoor settings."
