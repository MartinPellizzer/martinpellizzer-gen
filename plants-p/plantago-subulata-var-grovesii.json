It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender flowering stem. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
