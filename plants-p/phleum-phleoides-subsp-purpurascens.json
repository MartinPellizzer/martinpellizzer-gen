    "intro": "Phleum phleoides subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple hill oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purple hue, especially under stress or during certain growth stages. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
