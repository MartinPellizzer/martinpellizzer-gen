    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris microstegia, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular groups. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
