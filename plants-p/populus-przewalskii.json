    "intro": "Populus przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Populus przewalskii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal uses."
