    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. reclinatum, commonly known as the recurved holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often recurved or rolled under at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
