    "intro": "Potentilla pseudochrysantha, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
