    "intro": "Potentilla proanserina, commonly known as the mountain potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla proanserina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
