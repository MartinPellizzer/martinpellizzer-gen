    "intro": "Potentilla parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features wiry, branched stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla parviflora is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
