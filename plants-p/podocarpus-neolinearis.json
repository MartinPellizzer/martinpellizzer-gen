    "intro": "Podocarpus neolinearis, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Podocarpus neolinearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
