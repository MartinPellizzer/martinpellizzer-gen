    "intro": "Peucedanum austriacum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine cow parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbels. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent and is part of the Apiaceae family. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters."
