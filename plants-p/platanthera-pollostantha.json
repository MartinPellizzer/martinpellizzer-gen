    "intro": "Platanthera pollostantha, commonly known as the Florida lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
