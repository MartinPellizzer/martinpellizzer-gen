    "intro": "Panax fraxinifolius, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its rarity and high demand, it is considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
