    "intro": "Potentilla gibelliana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla gibelliana is adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a characteristic species of alpine and subalpine environments."
