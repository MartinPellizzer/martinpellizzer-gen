    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 venusta var. weldeniana, commonly known as the Welden\u2019s primrose, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
