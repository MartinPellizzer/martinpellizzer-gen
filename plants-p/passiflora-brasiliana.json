    "intro": "Passiflora brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by wildlife and humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora brasiliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
