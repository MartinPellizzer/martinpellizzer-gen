    "intro": "Potentilla reverdattoi, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, deciduous leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
