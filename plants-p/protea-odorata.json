    "intro": "Protea odorata, commonly known as the sweet protea, is a striking South African flowering plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous pink to white flower heads, which are actually clusters of tiny individual flowers. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Protea odorata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
