    "intro": "Pylostachya, commonly known as the beardgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Pylostachya species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes."
