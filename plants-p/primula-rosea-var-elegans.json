    "intro": "Primula rosea var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and lavender. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and they form a basal rosette. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens."
