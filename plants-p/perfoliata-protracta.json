    "intro": "Perfoliata protracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Perfoliata protracta is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
