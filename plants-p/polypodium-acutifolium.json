    "intro": "Polypodium acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Polypodium acutifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
