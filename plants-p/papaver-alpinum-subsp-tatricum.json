    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subsp. tatricum, commonly known as the Tatric Mountains poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers with a dark central blotch, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine habitats."
