    "intro": "Pteris lathyropteris, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pteris lathyropteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in tropical gardens and indoor plant collections."
