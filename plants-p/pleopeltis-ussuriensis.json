    "intro": "Pleopeltis ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri pleated fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pleated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
