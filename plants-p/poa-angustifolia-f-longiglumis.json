    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. longiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poa with long glumes, is a variant of the narrow-leaved grass species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and distinctive, elongated glumes that distinguish it from the typical form. This plant is typically found in moist, grassy habitats and is often associated with alpine or subalpine environments. It has a low-growing habit with tufted growth and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The botanical features of this form make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical classification."
