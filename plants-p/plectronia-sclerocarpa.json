    "intro": "Plectronia sclerocarpa, commonly known as the rock cypress, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it withstand extreme temperatures and drought. Plectronia sclerocarpa is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
