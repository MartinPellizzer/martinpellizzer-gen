    "intro": "Polypodium depressum, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, contributing to its resilience in various habitats. Polypodium depressum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
