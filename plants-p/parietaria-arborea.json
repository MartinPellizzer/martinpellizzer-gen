    "intro": "Parietaria arborea, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Parietaria arborea is known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
