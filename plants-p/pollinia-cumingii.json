    "intro": "Pollinia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's orchid, is a unique orchid species characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate pollination. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, with a complex structure that supports its pollination mechanism. The pollinia are attached to a viscid, sticky base that adheres to the bodies of pollinators such as bees and flies. This adaptation enhances its reproductive success in its native habitat."
