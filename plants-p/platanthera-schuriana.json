    "intro": "Platanthera schuriana, commonly known as the Schur's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spirally arranged floral spikes that produce fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies and moths, and it relies on a complex relationship with its fungal partners for nutrient absorption. Platanthera schuriana is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
