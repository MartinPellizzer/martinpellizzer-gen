    "intro": "Polypodium distans var. adnatum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors, preferring calcareous substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
