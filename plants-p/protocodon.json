    "intro": "Protocodon, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are herbaceous perennials with alternate, simple, and usually palmately lobed leaves. They produce showy, umbellate inflorescences with white or pink flowers. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
