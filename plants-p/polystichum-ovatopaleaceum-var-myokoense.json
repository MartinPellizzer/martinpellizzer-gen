    "intro": "Polystichum ovatopaleaceum var. myokoense, commonly known as the Myoko Shield Fern, is a variant of the ovatopaleaceum species within the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. Native to Japan, it thrives in cool, moist environments such as shaded forest floors. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, particularly for shaded garden settings."
