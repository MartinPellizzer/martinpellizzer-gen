    "intro": "Pachyphytum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky pachyphytum, is a succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
