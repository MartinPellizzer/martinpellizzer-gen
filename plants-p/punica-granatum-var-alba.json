    "intro": "Punica granatum var. alba, commonly known as the white pomegranate, is a variant of the pomegranate plant characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and fruit. This variety is native to regions of the Middle East and South Asia, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the stems are woody and often thornless. The fruit, though similar in shape to the common pomegranate, is smaller and has a less intense red color, with a milder flavor. It is valued for ornamental purposes and for its edible seeds, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
