    "intro": "Pandanus barkleyi, commonly known as the Barking Tree, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, spiky fruits. Its bark is fibrous and has been historically used for making ropes and mats. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
