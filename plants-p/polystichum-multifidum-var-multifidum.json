    "intro": "Polystichum multifidum var. multifidum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features elegant, bipinnate fronds that are dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing sori are clustered on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern family."
