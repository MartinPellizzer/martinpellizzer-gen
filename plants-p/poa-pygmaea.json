    "intro": "Poa pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapting to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are spikelets that are usually inconspicuous, and it reproduces through wind-dispersed seeds. Poa pygmaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
