    "intro": "Piper grande var. puberulentum, commonly known as the rough large pepper, is a variant of the Piper grande species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
