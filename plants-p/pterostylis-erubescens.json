    "intro": "Pterostylis erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, resupinate (upside-down) leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often have a distinctive red or orange hue. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
