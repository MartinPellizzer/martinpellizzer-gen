    "intro": "Physalis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits covered in a white, waxy coating. These fruits, which are edible when ripe, contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red pulp. Physalis tomentosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens."
