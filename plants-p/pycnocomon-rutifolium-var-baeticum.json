    "intro": "Pycnocomon rutifolium var. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican pygmy pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, shrub-like conifer with needle-like leaves and cones that are typically red or brown in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
