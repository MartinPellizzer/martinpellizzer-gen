    "intro": "Primula capitata subsp. capitata, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and bears clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces numerous stamens and a prominent pistil, typical of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
