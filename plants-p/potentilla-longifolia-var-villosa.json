    "intro": "Potentilla longifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from May to June. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous spreading stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five leaflets that are oval to lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of pubescence. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
