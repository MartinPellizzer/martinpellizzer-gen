    "intro": "Panicum urticans, commonly known as the stinging panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, bristly foliage that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
