It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears. Its fruit is typically harvested in late summer and is valued for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Pyrus obovalis is often found in moist woodland areas and thrives in partial shade."
