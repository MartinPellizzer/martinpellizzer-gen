    "intro": "Pericodia perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy pericodia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its unique growth habit involves the leaves forming a rosette, which helps protect the plant from harsh environmental conditions. Pericodia perfoliata is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
