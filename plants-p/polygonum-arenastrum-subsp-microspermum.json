    "intro": "Polygonum arenastrum subsp. microspermum, commonly known as the sand polygonum, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant produces tiny, spherical seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry environments. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
