    "intro": "Pisonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting birds and insects. The plant produces small, sticky fruits that adhere to the fur of animals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Pisonia glutinosa thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often found in mangrove ecosystems."
