    "intro": "Piper oblongum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, or green peppercorns used in cooking. Its fruit, called a peppercorn, is the dried, unripe fruit of the plant and contains the essential oil responsible for its pungent flavor. Piper oblongum is widely cultivated for its economic and culinary significance."
