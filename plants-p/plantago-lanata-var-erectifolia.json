    "intro": "Plantago lanata var. erectifolia, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to other plantain species."
