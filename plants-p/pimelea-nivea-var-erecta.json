The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving the plant a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long-lasting flowers."
