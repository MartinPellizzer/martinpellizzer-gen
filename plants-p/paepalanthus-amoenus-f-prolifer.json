    "intro": "Paepalanthus amoenus f. prolifer, commonly known as the prolific paepalanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
