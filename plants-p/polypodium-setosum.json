    "intro": "Polypodium setosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium setosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
