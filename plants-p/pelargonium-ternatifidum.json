    "intro": "Pelargonium ternatifidum, commonly known as the triple-lobed geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and give the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
