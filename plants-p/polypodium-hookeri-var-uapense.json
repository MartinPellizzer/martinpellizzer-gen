It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
