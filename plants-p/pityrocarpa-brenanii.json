    "intro": "Pityrocarpa brenanii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its slow growth and limited seed dispersal, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
