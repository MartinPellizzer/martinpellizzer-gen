    "intro": "Peperomia tejana, commonly known as Mexican pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. Peperomia tejana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
