    "intro": "Potamogeton tuberculatus, commonly known as the curly pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often coiled or twisted, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
