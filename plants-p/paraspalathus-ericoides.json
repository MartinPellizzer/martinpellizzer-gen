    "intro": "Paraspalathus ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Paraspalathus ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
