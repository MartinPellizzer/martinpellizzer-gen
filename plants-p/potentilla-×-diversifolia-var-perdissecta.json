    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 diversifolia var. perdissecta, commonly known as the dissected potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
