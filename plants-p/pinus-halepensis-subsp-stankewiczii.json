    "intro": "Pinus halepensis subsp. stankewiczii, commonly known as the Aleppo pine subspecies Stankewiczii, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Aleppo pine. The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more elongated, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
