It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
