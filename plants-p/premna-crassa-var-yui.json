It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
