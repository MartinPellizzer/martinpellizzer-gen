It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often ribbed or veined, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the water's surface."
