    "intro": "Pernettya prostrata, commonly known as the creeping cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Pernettya prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
