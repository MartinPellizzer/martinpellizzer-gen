    "intro": "Pilidiostigma papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan moonseed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with woody stems and trifoliate leaves. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and it is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
