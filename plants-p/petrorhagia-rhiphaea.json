    "intro": "Petrorhagia rhiphaea, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Petrorhagia rhiphaea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
