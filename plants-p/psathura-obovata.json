    "intro": "Psathura obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed psathura, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year spent as a basal rosette and the second year producing a flowering stem. The plant features compound leaves with a broadly ovate shape and a hairy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and are usually greenish-white in color. Psathura obovata is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia."
