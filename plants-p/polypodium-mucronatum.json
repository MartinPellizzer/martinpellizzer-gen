    "intro": "Polypodium mucronatum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, branching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is fibrous and can form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates. Polypodium mucronatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
