    "intro": "Podophyllum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved podophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, stout stem with two distinct types of leaves: a basal pair and a terminal pair, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
