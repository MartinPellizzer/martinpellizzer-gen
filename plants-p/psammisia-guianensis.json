    "intro": "Psammisia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in seed dispersal in its native habitat."
