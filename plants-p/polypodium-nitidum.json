    "intro": "Polypodium nitidum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The fronds are bi-directional, with both sterile and fertile leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family."
