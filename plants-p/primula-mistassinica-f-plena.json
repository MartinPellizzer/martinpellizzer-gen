    "intro": "Primula mistassinica f. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered mountain primrose, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the high elevations of the Canadian Rockies. It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, which bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, dark green leaves that are oval and slightly serrated, contributing to its rugged, alpine appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
