    "intro": "Plantago helleri, commonly known as Heller's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in disturbed soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
