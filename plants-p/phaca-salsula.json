    "intro": "Phaca salsula, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Phaca salsula plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in harsh climates."
