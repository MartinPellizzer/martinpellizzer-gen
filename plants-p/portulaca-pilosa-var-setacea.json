    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its hairy stems and leaves provide protection against intense sunlight and water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
