    "intro": "Prunus avium var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive willow-like leaves. This cultivar features elongated, narrow leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a unique appearance compared to typical peach trees. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters before the leaves fully emerge. It produces sweet, juicy fruit similar to other peaches, though the flavor can vary depending on growing conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
