    "intro": "Plectrachne pungens var. callosa, commonly known as the rough plectrachne, is a perennial grass native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
