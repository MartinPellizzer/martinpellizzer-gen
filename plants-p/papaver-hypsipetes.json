    "intro": "Papaver hypsipetes, commonly known as the tall poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive black or purple blotch at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces capsule fruits that release seeds in the fall. Papaver hypsipetes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
