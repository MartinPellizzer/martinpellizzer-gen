    "intro": "Perrierangraecum ambrense, commonly known as the Ambrense sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing smooth, brown seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
