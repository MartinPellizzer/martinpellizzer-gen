    "intro": "Pellaea brachyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain maidenhair, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pellaea brachyptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
