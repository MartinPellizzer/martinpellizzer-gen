    "intro": "Pteris mannii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Pteris mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
