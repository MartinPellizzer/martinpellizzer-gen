    "intro": "Phelypaea hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which aid in water retention and protection from herbivores. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Phelypaea hirtiflora plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
