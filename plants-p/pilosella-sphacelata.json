    "intro": "Pilosella sphacelata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella sphacelata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments."
