    "intro": "Polyanthina nemorosa, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features delicate, white, umbrella-shaped flower clusters that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Polyanthina nemorosa is often found in association with other early spring wildflowers in forest understories."
