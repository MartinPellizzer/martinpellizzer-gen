    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. solis, commonly known as the sun pea, is a variety of the common pea plant characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers. It produces elongated pods that contain several edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. The plant is typically cultivated for its seeds rather than its foliage, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a flowering period that usually occurs in late spring to early summer. This variety is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial companion plant in gardens and agricultural settings."
