    "intro": "Poa megalantha, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and can form large tussocks that dominate alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold, windy environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Poa megalantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
