    "intro": "Picea obovata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, obovate-shaped needles and conical crown. The plant thrives in cold, mountainous climates with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its foliage is typically a silvery-gray or white hue, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is valued for its resilience and is often used in reforestation and ecological restoration projects in alpine zones."
