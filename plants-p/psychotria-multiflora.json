    "intro": "Psychotria multiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Psychotria multiflora is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
