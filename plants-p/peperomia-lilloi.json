    "intro": "Peperomia lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia lilloi is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
