    "intro": "Pleopeltis ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many fern species."
