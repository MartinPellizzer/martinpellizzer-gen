    "intro": "Physematium euporolepis, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green basal leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
