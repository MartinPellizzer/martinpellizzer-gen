    "intro": "Polystachya phiriae, commonly known as the Fijian sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, dark brown coating, which helps in moisture retention. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
