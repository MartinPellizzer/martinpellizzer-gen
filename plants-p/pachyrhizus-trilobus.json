    "intro": "Pachyrhizus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed peanut plant, is a leguminous species native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with three distinct lobes and produces edible seeds enclosed in pods. The plant has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it is cultivated for its high-protein seeds. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
