    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum lanipes, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Pseudopogonatherum lanipes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small fauna in its native ecosystems."
