    "intro": "Pedicularis longipedicellata var. lanocalyx, commonly known as the woolly monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with distinctive, hairy sepals and petals. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
