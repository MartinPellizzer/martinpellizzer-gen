    "intro": "Phoradendron verticillatum var. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local bird species, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked."
