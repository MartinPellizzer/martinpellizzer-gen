It features semi-evergreen foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and rockeries."
