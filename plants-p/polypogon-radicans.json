    "intro": "Polypogon radicans, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u72d7\u5c3e\u8349, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomes that spread along the ground, enabling it to colonize various habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its environment. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
