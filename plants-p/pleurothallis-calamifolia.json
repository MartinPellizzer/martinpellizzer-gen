    "intro": "Pleurothallis calamifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and decaying organic matter. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
