    "intro": "Portlandia sessilifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pincushion. It is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in Western Australia. The plant features dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, surrounded by soft, woolly leaves. Its foliage is characterized by broad, sessile leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Portlandia sessilifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
