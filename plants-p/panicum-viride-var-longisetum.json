    "intro": "Panicum viride var. longisetum, commonly known as green panic grass with long bristles, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green, with a rough texture due to its dense pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop in some regions."
