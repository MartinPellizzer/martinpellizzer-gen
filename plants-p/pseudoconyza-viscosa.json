    "intro": "Pseudoconyza viscosa, commonly known as sticky weed or sand mat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fine, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and arid conditions, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable and persistent in various ecological settings."
