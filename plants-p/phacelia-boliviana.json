    "intro": "Phacelia boliviana, commonly known as Bolivian phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to high-altitude environments. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia boliviana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
