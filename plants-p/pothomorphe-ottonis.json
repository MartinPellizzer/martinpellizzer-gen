    "intro": "Pothomorphe ottonis, commonly known as the golden groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its small, round, orange to red fruits, which resemble tiny tomatoes and are edible when ripe. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
