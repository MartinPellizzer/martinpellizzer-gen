    "intro": "Potentilla recta subsp. laciniosa, commonly known as the lacecap potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
