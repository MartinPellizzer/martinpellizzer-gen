    "intro": "Panicum restitutum, commonly known as the restoration grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-green seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to landscapes. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
