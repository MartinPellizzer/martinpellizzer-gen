    "intro": "Pinus thunbergii var. oculus-draconis, commonly known as the Dragon's Eye Japanese Red Pine, is a rare and unique variant of the Japanese red pine. It is characterized by its striking, dark red bark and conical shape, which becomes more pronounced with age. The needles are typically shorter and stiffer compared to other pine species, contributing to its distinct appearance. This variety is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists."
