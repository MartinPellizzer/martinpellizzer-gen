It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries, which are edible and have a sweet, astringent flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued not only for its fruit but also for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
