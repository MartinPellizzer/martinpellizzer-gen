    "intro": "Plantago hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian plantain, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii, including high sunlight exposure and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
