    "intro": "Pandanus muralis, commonly known as the beach pandanus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into fibrous fruits, which are dispersed by wind. Its adaptability to salty air and sandy soils makes it a common sight along beaches and dunes. The leaves are also valued for their durability and are used in weaving and thatching."
