It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to thrive in wetland environments makes it an important component of marsh and swamp ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
