    "intro": "Puya ultima, commonly known as the \"last puya,\" is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the bromeliad family. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom sequentially along the inflorescence. Puya ultima is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
