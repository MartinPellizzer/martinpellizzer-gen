    "intro": "Pedicularis pantlingii, commonly known as the Pantling's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling those of snapdragons. It typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it can receive sufficient sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
