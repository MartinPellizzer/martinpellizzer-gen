    "intro": "Prenanthes roanensis, commonly known as Roan mountain bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. It has slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
