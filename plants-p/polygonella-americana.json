    "intro": "Polygonella americana, commonly known as American mountain moss, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with small, clustered leaves that are often reddish in color. Its flowers are inconspicuous, occurring in dense, greenish-white clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Polygonella americana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland and riparian environments."
