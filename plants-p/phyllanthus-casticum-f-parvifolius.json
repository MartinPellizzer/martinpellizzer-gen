    "intro": "Phyllanthus casticum f. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved casticum, is a variant of the casticum plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
