    "intro": "Platytaenia heterodonta, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually compound, with a distinctive two-row arrangement of pinnae. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
