    "intro": "Phoebe calcarea, commonly known as the limestone phoebe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Phoebe calcarea is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
