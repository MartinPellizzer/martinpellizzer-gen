    "intro": "Pappobolus amoenus var. lambayequensis, commonly known as the Lambayeque pappobolus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal dunes and along the edges of saltwater lagoons, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
