    "intro": "Porophyllum obscurum, commonly known as the darkleaf ratany, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
