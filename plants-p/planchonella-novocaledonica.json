    "intro": "Planchonella novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia planchonella, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
