    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. wimanniana, commonly known as the Wimann's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
