    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring. The plant is known for its edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in the summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its berries are toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
