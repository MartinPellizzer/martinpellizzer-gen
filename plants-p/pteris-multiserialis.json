    "intro": "Pteris multiserialis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the margins of the pinnae."
