It is a small, globular cactus with a pale green to white body, often covered in fine, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
