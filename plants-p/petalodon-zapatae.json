    "intro": "Petalodon zapatae, commonly known as the Zapata petalodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white petals and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. Petalodon zapatae is adapted to seasonal flooding, with its roots capable of tolerating waterlogged soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
