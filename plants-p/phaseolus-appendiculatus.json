    "intro": "Phaseolus appendiculatus, commonly known as the appendiculate bean, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its edible beans. The species is also of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological features and potential for genetic research."
