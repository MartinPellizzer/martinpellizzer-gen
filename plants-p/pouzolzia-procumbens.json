    "intro": "Pouzolzia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate pouzolzia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its sprawling, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pouzolzia procumbens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures."
