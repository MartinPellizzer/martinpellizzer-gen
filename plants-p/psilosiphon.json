    "intro": "Psilosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. Psilosiphon species often have a compact growth habit and are popular in rock gardens due to their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as *Psilosiphon maritimus*, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
