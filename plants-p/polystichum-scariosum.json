    "intro": "Polystichum scariosum, commonly known as the scarious sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a thin, scaly layer."
