    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa subsp. paralias, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in harsh coastal environments, often growing on dunes or rocky shores. Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
