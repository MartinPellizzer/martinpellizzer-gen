    "intro": "Phippsia nutkaensis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern phippsia, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers, which are typically pink or white, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
