    "intro": "Physalis polyphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow-orange berries enclosed in a papery calyx. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are bell-shaped and produce a distinctive fruit that turns red when mature. Physalis polyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
