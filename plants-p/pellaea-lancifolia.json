    "intro": "Pellaea lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to South America. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea lancifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
