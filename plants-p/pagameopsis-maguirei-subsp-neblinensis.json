    "intro": "Pagameopsis maguirei subsp. neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's pagameopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, with elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or among mosses. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
