    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 mohacsyana, commonly known as the Moh\u00e1cs pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (European spindletree). It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring attractive yellow to orange flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with a rounded habit and dark green foliage. Its fruit is edible, though often smaller and less sweet compared to traditional pears. It is cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential in horticultural breeding programs."
