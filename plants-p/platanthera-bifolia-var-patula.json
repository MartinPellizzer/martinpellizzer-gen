    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. patula, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces a dense, spiral arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflorescence, which consists of a loose spike of pale green to white flowers with prominent, showy sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands and requires specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
