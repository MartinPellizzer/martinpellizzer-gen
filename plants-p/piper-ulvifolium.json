    "intro": "Piper ulvifolium, commonly known as Hawaiian pepper or kona pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, containing the aromatic seeds used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its unique flavor profile.
