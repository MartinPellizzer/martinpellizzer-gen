    "intro": "Polystichum mohrioides var. typicum, commonly known as the Mohri's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
