    "intro": "Polylepis serrata, commonly known as the Andean mountain wax tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it survive in cold and dry environments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Polylepis serrata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is also considered an endangered species."
