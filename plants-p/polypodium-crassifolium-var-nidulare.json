    "intro": "Polypodium crassifolium var. nidulare, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved polypody. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant features fronds that are broad, leathery, and deeply divided, with a distinctive appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. This variety is well adapted to humid, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
