    "intro": "Puccinellia alticola, commonly known as the alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia alticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
