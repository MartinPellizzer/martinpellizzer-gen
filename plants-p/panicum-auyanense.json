    "intro": "Panicum auyanense, commonly known as the Auyanense Panicgrass, is a species of grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
