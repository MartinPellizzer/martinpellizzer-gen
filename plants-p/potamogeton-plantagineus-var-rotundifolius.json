    "intro": "Potamogeton plantagineus var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has long, slender stems that are often branched and bear small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
