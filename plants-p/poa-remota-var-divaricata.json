    "intro": "Poa remota var. divaricata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in natural areas."
