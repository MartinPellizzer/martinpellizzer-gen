    "intro": "Panax colensoi var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in New Zealand's native flora."
