    "intro": "Preussiodora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with glossy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, Preussiodora is now classified as an endangered species."
