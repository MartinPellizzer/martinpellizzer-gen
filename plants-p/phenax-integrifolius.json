    "intro": "Phenax integrifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf fenax, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth along their edges, a characteristic reflected in its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Phenax integrifolius is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
