    "intro": "Pavonia viscosa, commonly known as sticky pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use."
