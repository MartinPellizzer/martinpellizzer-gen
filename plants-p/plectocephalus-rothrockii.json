    "intro": "Plectocephalus rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert habitats. Plectocephalus rothrockii is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
