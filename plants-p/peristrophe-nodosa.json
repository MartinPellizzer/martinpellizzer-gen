    "intro": "Peristrophe nodosa, commonly known as the nodding peristrophe, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely grown outside its native habitat."
