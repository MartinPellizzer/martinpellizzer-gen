    "intro": "Phaulopsis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered phaulopsis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, brightly colored blooms, often in shades of red, pink, or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
