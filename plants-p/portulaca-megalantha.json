It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have five petals and numerous stamens. Portulaca megalantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
