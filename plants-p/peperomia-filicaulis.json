    "intro": "Peperomia filicaulis, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia filicaulis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
