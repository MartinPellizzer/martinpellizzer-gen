    "intro": "Potamopitys campylosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
