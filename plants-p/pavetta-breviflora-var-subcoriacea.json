    "intro": "Pavetta breviflora var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a leathery texture and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Small, white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed berries that are typically red when mature. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
