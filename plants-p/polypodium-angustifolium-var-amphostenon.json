    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. amphostenon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, finely serrated margin. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or calcareous substrates. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
