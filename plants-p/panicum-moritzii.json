    "intro": "Panicum moritzii, commonly known as Moritz's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces fluffy, paniculate inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a bluish-gray hue due to fine hairs covering the leaves. Panicum moritzii is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
