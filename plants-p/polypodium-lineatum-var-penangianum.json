    "intro": "Polypodium lineatum var. penangianum, commonly known as the Penang rock fern, is a variant of the common huperzia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. This variety is noted for its adaptability to specific microhabitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
