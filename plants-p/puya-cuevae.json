    "intro": "Puya cuevae, commonly known as the Andean torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and densely packed, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. Puya cuevae is not only botanically significant but also culturally important to the indigenous peoples of the Andes."
