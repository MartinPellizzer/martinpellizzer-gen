    "intro": "Prunus sibirica var. typica, commonly known as the Siberian apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray-barked trunk and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The fruit is often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to its tart flavor."
