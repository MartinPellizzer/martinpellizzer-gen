    "intro": "Picea orientalis f. aureospicata, commonly known as the golden-spike fir, is a rare and striking variant of the oriental spruce. It is characterized by its unique golden-yellow bracts that appear on the female cones, setting it apart from the typical green bracts of the species. This ornamental feature makes it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and specialized collections. The plant retains the conical shape and needle-like leaves of its parent species, with a dense, pyramidal crown. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in mountainous regions where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
