    "intro": "Panicum obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broadflower panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads, which are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
