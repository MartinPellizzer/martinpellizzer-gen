    "intro": "Pteridium arachnoideum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like fronds that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
