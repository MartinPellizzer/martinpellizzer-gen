    "intro": "Pyrus pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, waxy coating on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible pome fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Pyrus pruinosa is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and historical significance in horticulture."
