    "intro": "Phlomis lanceolata, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with grayish-green, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and aromatic. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for respiratory and skin conditions."
