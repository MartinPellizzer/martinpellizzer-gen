    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. pratensis, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape. This variety is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat."
