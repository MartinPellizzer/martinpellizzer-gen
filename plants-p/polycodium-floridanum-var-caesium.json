    "intro": "Polycodium floridanum var. caesium, commonly known as the Florida polycodium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed capsules. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and pine flatwoods. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is often found in protected areas."
