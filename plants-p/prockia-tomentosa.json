    "intro": "Prockia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly prockia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. Prockia tomentosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
