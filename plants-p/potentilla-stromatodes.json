    "intro": "Potentilla stromatodes, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, showy flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
