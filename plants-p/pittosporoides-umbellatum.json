    "intro": "Pittosporoides umbellatum, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for native birds."
