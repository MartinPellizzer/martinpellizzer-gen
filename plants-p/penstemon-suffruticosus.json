    "intro": "Penstemon suffruticosus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to dry climates. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. Penstemon suffruticosus is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
