It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves. Paracorokia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.
