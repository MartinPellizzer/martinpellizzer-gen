It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
