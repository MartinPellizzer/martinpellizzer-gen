    "intro": "Pancratium calathiforme, commonly known as the golden arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy inflorescences with a spathe that resembles a helmet, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The foliage is broad and arrow-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
