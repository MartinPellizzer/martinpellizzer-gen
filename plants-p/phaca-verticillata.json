It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
