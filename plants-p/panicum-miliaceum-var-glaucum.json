    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. glaucum, commonly known as silver millet, is a drought-tolerant annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss, and its inflorescence consists of panicles with small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are rich in nutrients and have been used as a food source for humans and animals. Its growth habit is prostrate to upright, depending on environmental conditions, and it thrives in poor soils with minimal water. The varietal name \"glaucum\" refers to its bluish-gray appearance, which is characteristic of its foliage."
