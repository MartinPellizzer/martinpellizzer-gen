    "intro": "Pleroma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pleroma, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Pleroma lanceolatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
