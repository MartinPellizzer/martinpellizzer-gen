    "intro": "Polygonum hygrogenes, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Polygonum hygrogenes is valued for its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for aquatic life."
