    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum iturupense, commonly known as the Iturup lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Iturup lichen is often found on tree bark and rocks in humid, shaded areas, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
