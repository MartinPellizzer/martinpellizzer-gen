    "intro": "Pinus glomerata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, twisted branches that form a dense, rounded shape. The tree produces small, clustered cones and has needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
