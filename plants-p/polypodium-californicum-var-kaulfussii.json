    "intro": "Polypodium californicum var. kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's holly fern, is a variant of the California holly fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon."
