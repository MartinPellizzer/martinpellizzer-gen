    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. sinuatum, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue light at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique feature makes it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitats."
