    "intro": "Paspalum obtusatum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, bluish-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand salt spray, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in maritime environments."
