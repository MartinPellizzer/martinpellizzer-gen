    "intro": "Piofontia jenesana, commonly known as the Jenesan rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
