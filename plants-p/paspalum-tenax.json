    "intro": "Paspalum tenax, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Paspalum tenax is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
