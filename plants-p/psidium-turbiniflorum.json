    "intro": "Psidium turbiniflorum, commonly known as the turbiniflorum guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (spiral-shaped) flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common guavas but have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The species is valued for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture and local food systems."
