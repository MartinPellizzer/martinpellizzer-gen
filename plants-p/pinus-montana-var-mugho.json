    "intro": "Pinus montana var. mugho, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf pine, is a compact, slow-growing conifer native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which makes it well adapted to harsh, cold climates. The needles are typically dark green, growing in pairs, and the cones are small and cylindrical, maturing within one growing season. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is commonly used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
