    "intro": "Prenanthes triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered water hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescence. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with the plant."
