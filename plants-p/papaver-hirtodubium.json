    "intro": "Papaver hirtodubium, commonly known as the rough-tomentose poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces striking, bright red flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
