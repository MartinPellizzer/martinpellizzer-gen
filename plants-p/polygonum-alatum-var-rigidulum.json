    "intro": "Polygonum alatum var. rigidulum, commonly known as the stiff-leaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
