    "intro": "Papaver horridum, commonly known as the scarlet poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a dark central disk, which are typically 5 to 7 cm in diameter. The plant grows from a stout, hairy stem and has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
