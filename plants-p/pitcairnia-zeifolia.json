    "intro": "Pitcairnia zeifolia, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange. Its unique leaf structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pitcairnia zeifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
