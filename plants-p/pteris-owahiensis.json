    "intro": "Pteris owahiensis, commonly known as the Oahu water fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, delicate fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris owahiensis is notable for its ecological significance and is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
