    "intro": "Plagiobothrys kingii, commonly known as King's narrowleaf bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
