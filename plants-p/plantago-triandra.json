It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
