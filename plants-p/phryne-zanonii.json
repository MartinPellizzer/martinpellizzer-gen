    "intro": "Phryne zanonii, commonly known as the Zanonii's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its delicate, narrow leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phryne zanonii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
