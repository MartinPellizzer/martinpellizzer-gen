    "intro": "Parmentiera morii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry habitats."
