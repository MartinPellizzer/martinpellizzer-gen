    "intro": "Promenaea microptera, commonly known as the small-winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the understory of humid forests. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Promenaea microptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
