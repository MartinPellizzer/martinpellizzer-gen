It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers with three petals, which are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
