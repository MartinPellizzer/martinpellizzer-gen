    "intro": "Polypodium grammicum, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium grammicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
