    "intro": "Picramnia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf picramnia, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
