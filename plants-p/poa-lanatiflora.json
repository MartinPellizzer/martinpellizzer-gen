    "intro": "Poa lanatiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa lanatiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
