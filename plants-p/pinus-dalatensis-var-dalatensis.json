    "intro": "Pinus dalatensis var. dalatensis, commonly known as the Dalat pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal tree form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown hue, and the tree produces both male and female cones on the same individual. This species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native range."
