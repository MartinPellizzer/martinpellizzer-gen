    "intro": "Prospero minimum, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It features attractive, glossy evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it drought-tolerant. It bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Prospero minimum is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
