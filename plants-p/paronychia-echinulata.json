    "intro": "Paronychia echinulata, commonly known as the spiked sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in sandy or rocky soils. Paronychia echinulata is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, coastal habitats."
