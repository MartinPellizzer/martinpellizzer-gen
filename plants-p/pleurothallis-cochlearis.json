    "intro": "Pleurothallis cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a helical pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pleurothallis cochlearis is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
