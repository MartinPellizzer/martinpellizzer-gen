It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often accompanied by yellowish or greenish bracts. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, containing various alkaloids and diterpenoids. Phylacium scandens is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gardens, and forest edges."
