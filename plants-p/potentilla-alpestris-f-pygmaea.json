    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
