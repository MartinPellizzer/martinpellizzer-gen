    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid knotgrass, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often branched, with small, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which appear in late spring to early summer. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
