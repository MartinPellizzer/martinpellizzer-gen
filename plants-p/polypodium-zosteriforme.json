    "intro": "Polypodium zosteriforme, commonly known as the ladder brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often creeping growth habit. The plant features finely divided, linear fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
