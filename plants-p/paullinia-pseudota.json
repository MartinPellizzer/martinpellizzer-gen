    "intro": "Paullinia pseudota, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that are edible but have a peppery taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
