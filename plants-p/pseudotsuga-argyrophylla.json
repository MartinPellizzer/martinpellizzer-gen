    "intro": "Pseudotsuga argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and silver-gray bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it its common name. It produces cones that hang from branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery covering. The silver fir is adapted to grow in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions."
