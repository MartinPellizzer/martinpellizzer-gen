It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feathery segments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in raceme clusters, followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. It is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which have industrial and potential medicinal uses. The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in environmental restoration."
