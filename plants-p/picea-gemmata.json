    "intro": "Picea gemmata, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 5 to 15 meters, with a conical shape and a dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches, and its cones are small, woody, and often persist on the branches for several years. Picea gemmata is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a slow growth rate and a strong resistance to cold and wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage."
