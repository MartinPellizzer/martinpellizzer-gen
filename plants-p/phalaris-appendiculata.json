    "intro": "Phalaris appendiculata, commonly known as the clustered bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its seed heads are distinctive for their dense, rounded appearance. Phalaris appendiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
