    "intro": "Phlox littoralis, commonly known as coastal phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the shores of salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features showy clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Phlox littoralis is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding."
