    "intro": "Prunus omissa, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other apricot varieties. Prunus omissa is often grown for its ornamental value due to its showy blossoms and delicate foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
