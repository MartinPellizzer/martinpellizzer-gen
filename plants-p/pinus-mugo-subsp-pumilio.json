    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, tufted foliage that forms a cushion-like growth habit. The needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in clusters of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature to a dark brown color. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
