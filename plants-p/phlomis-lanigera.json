    "intro": "Phlomis lanigera, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and tall, erect stems that bear large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in dense, white\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phlomis lanigera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
