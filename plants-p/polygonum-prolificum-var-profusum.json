    "intro": "Polygonum prolificum var. profusum, commonly known as the profuse knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces numerous stolons that help it spread aggressively. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
