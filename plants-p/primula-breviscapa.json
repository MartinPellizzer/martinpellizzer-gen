    "intro": "Primula breviscapa, commonly known as the short-horned primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture. Primula breviscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
