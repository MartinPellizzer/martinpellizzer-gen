Packera species are native to North America and are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. They have basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped or lanceolate, and their stems are often hairy. The genus includes around 40 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
