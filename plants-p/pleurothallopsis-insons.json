    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis insons, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with slender, leafless stems and small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pleurothallopsis insons is considered a conservation concern."
