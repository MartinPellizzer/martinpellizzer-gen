    "intro": "Pinus polita, commonly known as the smooth-cork pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often retained on the branches for many years, a feature known as serotiny, which aids in seed dispersal after fire events. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Pinus polita plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
