    "intro": "Parapentas procurrens, commonly known as the creeping pentas, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Parapentas procurrens is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its persistent flowering display."
