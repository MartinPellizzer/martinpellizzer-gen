    "intro": "Penstemon triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Penstemon triphyllus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
