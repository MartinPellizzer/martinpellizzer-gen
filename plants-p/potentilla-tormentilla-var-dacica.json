    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. dacica, commonly known as the Dacian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. The plant features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
