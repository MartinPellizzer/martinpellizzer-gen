    "intro": "Psidium pubigerum, commonly known as the rough guava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that ripen to a yellow or red color. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
