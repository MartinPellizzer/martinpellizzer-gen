    "intro": "Prunus potosina, commonly known as the Potosi cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, bright red fruits that are similar to cherries. Prunus potosina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular plant in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
