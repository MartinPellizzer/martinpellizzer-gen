    "intro": "Pothos scolopendrioides, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a yellow or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in low light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it versatile for indoor and outdoor use."
