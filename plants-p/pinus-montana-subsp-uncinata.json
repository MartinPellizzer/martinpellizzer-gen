    "intro": "Pinus montana subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the Alpine white pine, is a subspecies of the white pine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its dark, scaly bark. The needles are typically longer than those of other pine species, growing in bundles of five and featuring a distinctive blue-green color. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the tree for several years. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, showing resilience to cold and poor soil conditions."
