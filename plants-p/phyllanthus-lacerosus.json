    "intro": "Phyllanthus lacerosus, commonly known as the roughleaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a small shrub or subshrub with woody stems and alternate, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. This plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
