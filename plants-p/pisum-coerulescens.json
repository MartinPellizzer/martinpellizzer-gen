    "intro": "Pisum coerulescens, commonly known as the blue pea, is a rare and unique legume species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue flowers, which are unusually pigmented due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and a climbing habit, typical of many leguminous plants. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
