    "intro": "Phemeranthus calcaricus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and ephemeral plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom only at night, making it a nocturnal flowering species. The plant has a short lifespan, with its flowers opening briefly before wilting by dawn. Its unique flowering behavior and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
