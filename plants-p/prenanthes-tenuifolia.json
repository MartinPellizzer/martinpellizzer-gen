    "intro": "Prenanthes tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It typically grows in moist, wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its toxic sap and foliage, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
