    "intro": "Pteris rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
