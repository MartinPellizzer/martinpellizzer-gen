    "intro": "Pouteria intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which resembles a large, spiky coconut and contains a single, hard-shelled nut inside. The nut is rich in oils and is a valuable source of protein and essential nutrients. Due to its ecological and economic importance, Pouteria intermedia plays a crucial role in both biodiversity and local communities."
