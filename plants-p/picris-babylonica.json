It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
