    "intro": "Potentilla grisea var. ripcola, commonly known as the riparian potentilla, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in moist, often riparian habitats. It typically grows along riverbanks and stream sides, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features wiry, often sprawling stems and small, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
