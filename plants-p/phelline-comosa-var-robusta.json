It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
