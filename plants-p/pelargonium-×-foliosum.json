    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 foliosum, commonly known as the ivy-leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
