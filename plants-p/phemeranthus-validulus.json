    "intro": "Phemeranthus validulus, commonly known as the ephemeral flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that open only for a short period, typically in the early morning. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Due to its brief blooming period, it is considered a rare and ephemeral species, adding to its ecological and botanical significance."
