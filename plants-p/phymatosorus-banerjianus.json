    "intro": "Phymatosorus banerjianus, commonly known as the Banerji's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phymatosorus banerjianus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
