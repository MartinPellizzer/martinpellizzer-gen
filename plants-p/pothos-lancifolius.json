    "intro": "Pothos lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are elongated and have a pointed tip, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its foliage than its blooms. Its leaves are glossy and can grow up to 10 inches long, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in low light conditions and requires moderate watering, making it an easy plant to care for."
