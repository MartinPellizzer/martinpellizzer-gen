    "intro": "Pyrethrum syriacum, commonly known as Syrian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow-orange petals and a central disk. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which contain the seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pyrethrum syriacum is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds."
