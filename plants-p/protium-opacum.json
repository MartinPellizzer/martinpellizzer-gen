    "intro": "Protium opacum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Protium opacum plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
