    "intro": "Pseudolycopodium densum, commonly known as the dense clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Pseudolycopodium densum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
