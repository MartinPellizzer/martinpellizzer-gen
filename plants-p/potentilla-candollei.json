    "intro": "Potentilla candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla candollei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
