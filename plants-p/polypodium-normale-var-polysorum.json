    "intro": "Polypodium normale var. polysorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf sword fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lanceolate, and serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots."
