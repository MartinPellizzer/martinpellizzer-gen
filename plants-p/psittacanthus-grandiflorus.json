    "intro": "Psittacanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, slow-growing plant that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, featuring a thick, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
