It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. The Cape snowbush is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
