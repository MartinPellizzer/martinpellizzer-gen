    "intro": "Poa ruida, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-bearing flower clusters. Poa ruida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
