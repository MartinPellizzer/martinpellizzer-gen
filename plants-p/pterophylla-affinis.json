    "intro": "Pterophylla affinis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. This plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid and cool conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help it anchor to rocky substrates. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche, contributing to its survival in challenging environments."
