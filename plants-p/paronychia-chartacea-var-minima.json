    "intro": "Paronychia chartacea var. minima, commonly known as the miniature marsh holly, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to wet, marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in humid, boggy habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
