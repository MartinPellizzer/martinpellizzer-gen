    "intro": "Poa lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa lemmonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
