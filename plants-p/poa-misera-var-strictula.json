    "intro": "Poa misera var. strictula, commonly known as the slender bittergrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, and flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts but also serves as a food source for various grazing animals."
