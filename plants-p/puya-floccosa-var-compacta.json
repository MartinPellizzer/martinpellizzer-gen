    "intro": "Puya floccosa var. compacta, commonly known as the compact puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a tight, compact structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
