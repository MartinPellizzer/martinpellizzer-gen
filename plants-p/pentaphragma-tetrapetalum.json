    "intro": "Pentaphragma tetrapetalum, commonly known as the four-petaled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowering stems bear tiny, four-petaled flowers. This species is notable for its specialized adaptations to aquatic life and its role in supporting microscopic food webs."
