    "intro": "Potentilla glabra, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its root system is fibrous and capable of forming extensive colonies, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. Potentilla glabra is often found in meadows, roadsides, and dry, rocky areas where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
