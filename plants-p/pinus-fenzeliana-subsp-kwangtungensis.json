    "intro": "Pinus fenzeliana subsp. kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to southern China. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are long, slender, and typically occur in bundles of five, with a dark green color and a slight blue-gray tinge. The cones are woody, oblong, and often remain attached to the branches for many years. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
