    "intro": "Pleurostachys beyrichii, commonly known as the Guatemalan grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with moderate rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
