    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in high-altitude and coastal environments. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad, ribbed, and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds, salt spray, and low temperatures. This variant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky coastal areas across the northern hemisphere."
