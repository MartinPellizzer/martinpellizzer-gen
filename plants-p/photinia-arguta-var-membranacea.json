    "intro": "Photinia arguta var. membranacea, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its striking seasonal color changes."
