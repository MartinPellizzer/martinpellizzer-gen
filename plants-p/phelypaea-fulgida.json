    "intro": "Phelypaea fulgida, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, bright yellow fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Phelypaea fulgida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
