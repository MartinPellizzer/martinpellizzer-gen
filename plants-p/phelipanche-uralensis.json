    "intro": "Phelipanche uralensis, commonly known as the greater yellowtop, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive potential and impact on crop yields."
