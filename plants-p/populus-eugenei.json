    "intro": "Populus eugenei, commonly known as the Eugene poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Populus eugenei typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
