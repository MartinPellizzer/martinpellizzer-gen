It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and is often found in association with other native grasses. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and poor soil conditions."
