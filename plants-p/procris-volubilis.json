    "intro": "Procris volubilis, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems that enable it to climb and spread over other plants or structures. The plant produces small, delicate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds. Procris volubilis thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas of forests."
