    "intro": "Pycnocoma decaryana, commonly known as the silverleaf pycnocoma, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Pycnocoma decaryana is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
