It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique floral structure."
