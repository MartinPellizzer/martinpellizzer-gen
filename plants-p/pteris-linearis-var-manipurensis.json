It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
