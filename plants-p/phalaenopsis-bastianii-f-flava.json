    "intro": "Phalaenopsis bastianii f. flava, commonly known as the Yellow Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, golden-yellow flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters and can last for several months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
