It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears a single, showy, purple or pink flower with many petals. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Pulsatilla patens subsp. angustifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
