    "intro": "Poa anceps var. elata, commonly known as the tall hair grass, is a variant of the hair grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
