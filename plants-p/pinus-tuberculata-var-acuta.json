    "intro": "Pinus tuberculata var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-barked pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed cones and thick, scaly bark. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its needles are long and slender, often retaining their color through the winter, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes planted in gardens for its unique appearance."
