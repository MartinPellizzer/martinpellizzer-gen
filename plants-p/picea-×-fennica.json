    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 fennica, commonly known as the Sitka spruce \u00d7 white spruce hybrid, is a cross between the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and the white spruce (Picea glauca). It is a medium to large evergreen conifer native to North America, typically found in boreal and subalpine regions. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals around the stem. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often used in reforestation due to its adaptability and rapid growth. The hybrid is valued for its durable wood and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
