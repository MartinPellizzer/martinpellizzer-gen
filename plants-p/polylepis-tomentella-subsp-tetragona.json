    "intro": "Polylepis tomentella subsp. tetragona, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and branching structure, which provide habitat for various endemic species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
