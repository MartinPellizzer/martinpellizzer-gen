    "intro": "Poa spinosa, commonly known as the prickly bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often spiny leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Poa spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
