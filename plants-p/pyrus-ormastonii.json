    "intro": "Pyrus ormastonii, commonly known as the Ormaston pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruit that typically ripens in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
