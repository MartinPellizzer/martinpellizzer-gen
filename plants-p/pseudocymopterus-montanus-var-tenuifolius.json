    "intro": "Pseudocymopterus montanus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
