    "intro": "Primula beringensis, commonly known as the Bering primrose, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture in harsh climates. Primula beringensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
