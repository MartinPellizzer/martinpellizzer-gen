    "intro": "Poecilopteris presliana, commonly known as the Preslia fern, is a species of fossilized fern that dates back to the Late Cretaceous period. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex, dichotomous branching pattern. The plant is notable for its well-preserved reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, which provide valuable insights into ancient plant reproduction. Found in various sedimentary rock formations across Europe and North America, it thrived in warm, humid environments. Its fossilized remains contribute significantly to the study of paleobotany and the evolution of ferns."
