It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in colder climates."
