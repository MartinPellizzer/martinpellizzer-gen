    "intro": "Priestleya curvifolia, commonly known as the curl-leaf pinyon, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes true pines, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically containing two seeds each. Priestleya curvifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its foliage and cones contribute to the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
