    "intro": "Peristera nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
