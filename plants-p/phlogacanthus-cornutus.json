    "intro": "Phlogacanthus cornutus, commonly known as the horned phlogacanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or wooded areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
