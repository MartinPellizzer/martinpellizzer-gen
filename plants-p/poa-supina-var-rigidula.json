    "intro": "Poa supina var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed or compacted soils."
