    "intro": "Pleurothallis fluminensis, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat in remote, humid environments, it is rarely seen in cultivation outside of specialized botanical gardens."
