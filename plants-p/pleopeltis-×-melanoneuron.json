    "intro": "Pleopeltis \u00d7 melanoneuron, commonly known as the black-veined rock fern, is a hybrid species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, contrasting veins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
