    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. grandiflora, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and rocky regions of Europe. It features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on slopes and in rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
