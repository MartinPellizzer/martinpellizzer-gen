    "intro": "Polystichum neolobatum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that are shorter and more upright than the sterile ones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, which contribute to its ornamental appeal."
