    "intro": "Potamogeton mucronatus f. obtusior, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a variant of the pondweed genus characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a blunt tip. It is an aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has elongated, cylindrical stems that are often submerged, with small, green flowers that appear in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are usually smooth and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense vegetation that supports aquatic life."
