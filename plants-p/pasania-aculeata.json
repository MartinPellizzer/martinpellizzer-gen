    "intro": "Pasania aculeata, commonly known as the prickly pasania, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Pasania aculeata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
