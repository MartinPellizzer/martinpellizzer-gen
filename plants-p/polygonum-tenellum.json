    "intro": "Polygonum tenellum, commonly known as the smooth knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Polygonum tenellum is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
