    "intro": "Phytolacca rivinoides, commonly known as the Indian black nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a distinctive upright stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries containing toxic seeds. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. The plant contains various alkaloids and glycosides, making it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
