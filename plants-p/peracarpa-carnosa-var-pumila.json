    "intro": "Peracarpa carnosa var. pumila, commonly known as the woolly peracarpa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
