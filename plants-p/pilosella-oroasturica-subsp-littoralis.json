    "intro": "Pilosella oroasturica subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pilosella, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground and stabilize dunes or coastal dunes. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme coastal conditions."
