It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Poa veresczaginii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
