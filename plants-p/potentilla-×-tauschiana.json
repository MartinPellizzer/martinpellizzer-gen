It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
