    "intro": "Parrya minjanensis, commonly known as the Minjanensis parrya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
