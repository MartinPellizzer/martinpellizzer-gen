    "intro": "Pleopeltis panamensis, commonly known as the Panama shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable. Pleopeltis panamensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small organisms and contributing to forest biodiversity."
