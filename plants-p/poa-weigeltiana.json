It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate regions."
