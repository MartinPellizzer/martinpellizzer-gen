    "intro": "Polystachya ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to white flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
