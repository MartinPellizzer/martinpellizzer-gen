    "intro": "Pisonia racemosa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble clusters of coral, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and simple, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Pisonia racemosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks."
