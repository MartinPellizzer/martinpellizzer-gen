    "intro": "Pleopeltis stolzei, commonly known as the Stolze's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, with a deep green coloration. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
