    "intro": "Pultenaea maritima, commonly known as the coastal pultenaea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features slender, often hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers, which are usually yellow or reddish in color, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. Pultenaea maritima is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
