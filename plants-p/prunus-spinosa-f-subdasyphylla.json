    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. subdasyphylla, commonly known as the hairy blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in late summer, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its foliage is often more densely hairy than that of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The botanical features of this form make it a notable subject in plant taxonomy and ecological studies."
