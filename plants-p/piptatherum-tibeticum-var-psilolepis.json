    "intro": "Piptatherum tibeticum var. psilolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its harsh habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
