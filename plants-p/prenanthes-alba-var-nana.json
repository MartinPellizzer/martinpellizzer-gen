It features small, white, ray-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable plant for wetland restoration and native garden landscapes."
