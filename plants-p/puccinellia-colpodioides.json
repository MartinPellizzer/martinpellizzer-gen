It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Puccinellia colpodioides is also a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
