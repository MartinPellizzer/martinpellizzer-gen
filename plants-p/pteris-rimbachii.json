    "intro": "Pteris rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, overlapping pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Pteris rimbachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
