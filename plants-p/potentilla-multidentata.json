    "intro": "Potentilla multidentata, commonly known as the many-toothed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with multiple serrated leaflets that give it its common name. Potentilla multidentata is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
