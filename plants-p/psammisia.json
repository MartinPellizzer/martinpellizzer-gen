    "intro": "Psammisia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and sandy environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. They often have small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale in color. The leaves are usually narrow and may have a hairy texture to reduce water loss. Psammisia species are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
