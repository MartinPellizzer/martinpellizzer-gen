    "intro": "Prunus sphaerocarpa f. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-shelled cherry, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark that gives it its common name, and its small, spherical fruits that are typically red or black when mature. The plant is native to specific regions of China and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. It has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable ornamental and botanical specimen."
