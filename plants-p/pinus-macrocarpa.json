    "intro": "Pinus macrocarpa, commonly known as the hoop pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its long, straight trunk and broad, spreading crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces large, edible seeds enclosed in woody cones, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal and inland rainforests. The hoop pine is also valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been historically used in construction and boat building."
