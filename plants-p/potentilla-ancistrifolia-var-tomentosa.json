    "intro": "Potentilla ancistrifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin. The variety tomentosa is distinguished by its thick, woolly covering, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
