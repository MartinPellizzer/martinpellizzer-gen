    "intro": "Pogonia trinervia, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its flowers have a unique structure with three sepals and three petals, with the lip being the most prominent and colorful part. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Pogonia trinervia is considered endangered in many regions."
