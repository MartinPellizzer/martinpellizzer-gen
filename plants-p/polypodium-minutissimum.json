    "intro": "Polypodium minutissimum, commonly known as the tiny wall fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in forest ecosystems."
