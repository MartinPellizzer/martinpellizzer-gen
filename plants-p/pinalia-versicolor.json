    "intro": "Pinalia versicolor, commonly known as the variable pinyon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes other coniferous trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its needle-like leaves and the production of cones that contain its seeds. Pinalia versicolor typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its variability in color and form has led to its common name, reflecting its ability to change appearance depending on environmental conditions."
