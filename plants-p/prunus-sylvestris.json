    "intro": "Prunus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry or European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland edges and open forests. Prunus sylvestris is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
