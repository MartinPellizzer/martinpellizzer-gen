    "intro": "Prockia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf prockia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, smooth-edged leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Prockia integrifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
