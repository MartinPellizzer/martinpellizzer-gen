It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive plant for ornamental gardening, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat."
