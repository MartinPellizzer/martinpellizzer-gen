    "intro": "Prionitis aucheri, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
