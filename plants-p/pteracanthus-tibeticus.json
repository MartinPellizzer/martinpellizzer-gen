    "intro": "Pteracanthus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Pteracanthus tibeticus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
