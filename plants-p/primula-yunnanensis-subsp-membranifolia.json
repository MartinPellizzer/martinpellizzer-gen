    "intro": "Primula yunnanensis subsp. membranifolia, commonly known as the Yunnan primrose, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It features a rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
