    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. apetiolata, commonly known as the short-stalked lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring rich, organic soils. The plant is distinguished by its reduced leaf stalks, which are shorter than the blade, giving it its specific epithet. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late summer, producing intricate inflorescences that attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
