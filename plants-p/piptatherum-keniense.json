It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland areas. Piptatherum keniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
