    "intro": "Pteris elata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments, giving it a lush, feathery look. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
