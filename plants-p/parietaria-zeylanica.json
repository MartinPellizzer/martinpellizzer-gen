    "intro": "Parietaria zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon wall creeper, is a flowering plant native to southern Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among plants in its ecological niche. The species is also characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
