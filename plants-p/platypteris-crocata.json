    "intro": "Platypteris crocata, commonly known as the crocodile fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that have a serrated edge resembling the scales of a crocodile. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Platypteris crocata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
