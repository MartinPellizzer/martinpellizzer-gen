    "intro": "Poecilopteris subrepanda, commonly known as the broad-veined water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiales. It is characterized by its large, dichotomously branched fronds with broad, overlapping pinnae. The plant had a complex vascular system, including well-developed xylem and phloem, which allowed it to thrive in wet, swampy environments. Its leaves were often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss. This species is significant in paleobotany as it provides insights into the evolution of early ferns and their adaptation to ancient ecosystems."
