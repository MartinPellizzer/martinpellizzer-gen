    "intro": "Pseudopyxis depressa var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pseudopyxis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its small, crustose thallus that forms a dense, foliose structure. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with narrow, elongated lobes that are often covered in a layer of fine, powdery substances. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
