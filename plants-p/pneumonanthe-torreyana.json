    "intro": "Pneumonanthe torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's lungwort, is a rare and endangered plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, basal leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Pneumonanthe torreyana is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions."
