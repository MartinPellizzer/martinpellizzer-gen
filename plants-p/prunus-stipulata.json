    "intro": "Prunus stipulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Japanese flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves with a pointed tip and a hairy underside. Its fruits are small, dark purple drupes that develop after the flowers. Prunus stipulata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal and seasonal blooms."
