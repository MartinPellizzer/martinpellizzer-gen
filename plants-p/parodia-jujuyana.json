    "intro": "Parodia jujuyana, commonly known as the Jujuy candle, is a cacti species native to Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that resemble candles, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It has a slow growth rate and is well-suited for arid environments due to its ability to store water in its thick stems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
