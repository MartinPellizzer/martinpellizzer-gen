    "intro": "Polylepis subquinquefolia, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant can grow up to 15 meters tall and is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and it produces edible fruits that are important for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
