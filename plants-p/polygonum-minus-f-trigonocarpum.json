    "intro": "Polygonum minus f. trigonocarpum, commonly known as the three-angled knotweed, is a variant of the polygonum genus characterized by its unique triangular seed pods. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native habitats. It is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows."
