    "intro": "Pogonatherum falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
