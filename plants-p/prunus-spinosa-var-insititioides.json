It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible but tart fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in the production of alcoholic beverages and jams, and the plant has historical uses in traditional medicine."
