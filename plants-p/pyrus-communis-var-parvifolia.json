    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its smaller, narrower leaves compared to typical pear varieties, which give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally less sweet than those of other pear cultivars. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and manageable size. This variety is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it suitable for both garden and landscape use."
