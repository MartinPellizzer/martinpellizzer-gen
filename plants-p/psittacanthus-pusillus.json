    "intro": "Psittacanthus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of gymnosperms, and its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Psittacanthus pusillus is relatively slow-growing and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived plant in the right conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
