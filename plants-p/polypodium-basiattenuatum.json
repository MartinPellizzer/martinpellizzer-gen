    "intro": "Polypodium basiattenuatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in moist soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
