    "intro": "Prescottia auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble delicate tears. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock surfaces. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
