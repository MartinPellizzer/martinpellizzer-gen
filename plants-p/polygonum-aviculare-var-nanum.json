    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a dense rosette formation. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments."
