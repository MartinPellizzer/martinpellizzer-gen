    "intro": "Ponerorchis monantha, commonly known as the single-stem orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its single, erect stem that bears a single spike of flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination. Ponerorchis monantha is noted for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
