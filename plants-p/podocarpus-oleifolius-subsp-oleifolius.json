    "intro": "Podocarpus oleifolius subsp. oleifolius, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by woody, cone-like structures. The tree produces aromatic, oily leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant. This species is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
