    "intro": "Pleragina, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Pleragina species typically grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to their rarity and unique appearance, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
