    "intro": "Pharus micranthus var. discolor, commonly known as the variable dwarf pharus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes variegated color on the underside, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
