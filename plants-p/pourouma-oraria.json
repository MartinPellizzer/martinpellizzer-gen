    "intro": "Pourouma oraria, commonly known as the yellow areca, is a tall, perennial herb native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, round fruits that are about the size of a pigeon's egg. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
