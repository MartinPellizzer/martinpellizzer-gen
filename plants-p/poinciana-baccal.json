    "intro": "Poinciana baccal, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves that turn bright red or orange during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. The tree's ability to thrive in poor soils and its drought tolerance further contribute to its widespread cultivation."
