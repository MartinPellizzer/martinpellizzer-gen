    "intro": "Polystachya wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a dense appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered in loose, branching structures. Polystachya wightiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
