    "intro": "Protasparagus clareae, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its yellowish-green flowers are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are part of its unique floral structure. Protasparagus clareae is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
