    "intro": "Pneumatopteris afra, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris afra plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
