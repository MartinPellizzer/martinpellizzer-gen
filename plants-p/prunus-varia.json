It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Prunus varia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
