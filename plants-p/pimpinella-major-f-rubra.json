    "intro": "Pimpinella major f. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed cow-wheat, is a variant of the cow-wheat species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The f. rubra form is notable for its vibrant red stem coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green-stemmed variety."
