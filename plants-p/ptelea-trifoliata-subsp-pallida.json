It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, which are often grayish-white in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
