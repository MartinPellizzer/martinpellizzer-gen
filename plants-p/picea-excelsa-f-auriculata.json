    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate white spruce, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its unique auriculate (ear-shaped) bracts on the cones, which set it apart from typical spruce species. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are dense and provide good insulation against cold temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its morphological uniqueness and ecological adaptations."
