    "intro": "Pitcairnia explosiva, commonly known as the exploding pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and vibrant, showy bracts that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Its unique name comes from the explosive manner in which its inflorescence opens, revealing the flowers in a dramatic display. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
