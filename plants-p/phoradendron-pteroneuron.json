    "intro": "Phoradendron pteroneuron, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces white, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds onto other trees. Its symbiotic relationship with host trees can have both positive and negative ecological impacts. The plant is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments."
