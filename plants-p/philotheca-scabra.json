    "intro": "Philotheca scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved philotheca, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Philotheca scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
