    "intro": "Plocoglottis striata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a striking, striped appearance due to the contrasting colors of its leaflets. Plocoglottis striata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
