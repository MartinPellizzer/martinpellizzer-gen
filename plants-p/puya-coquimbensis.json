    "intro": "Puya coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo puya, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to collect and store water in its native desert environment. Puya coquimbensis is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal rainfall."
