    "intro": "Panicum lanuginosum var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the dense pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
