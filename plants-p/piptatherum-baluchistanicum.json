    "intro": "Piptatherum baluchistanicum, commonly known as the Baluchistan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It typically grows in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often found in high-altitude areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including drought and extreme temperatures. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in arid ecosystems."
