It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of conifers. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and cold hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
