    "intro": "Picraena vellozoi, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small animals. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
