It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits resembling peaches. The fruit's pulp is rich in nutrients, and the seeds contain oils that have been used traditionally for various purposes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts in its native regions."
