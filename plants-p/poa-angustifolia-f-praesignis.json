    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. praesignis, commonly known as the narrowleaf Poa, is a hemicryptophytic perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. The plant typically blooms with small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce light blue to purple flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
