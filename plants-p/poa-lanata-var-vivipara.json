    "intro": "Poa lanata var. vivipara, commonly known as the woolly meadow grass, is a variant of the woolly grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of silky, white hairs on its leaves and stems. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy includes the production of viviparous shoots, which allow for rapid vegetative propagation. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
