    "intro": "Paullinia elegans subsp. elegans, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fragrant, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
