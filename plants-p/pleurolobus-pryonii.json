    "intro": "Pleurolobus pryonii, commonly known as the Yucat\u00e1n nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
