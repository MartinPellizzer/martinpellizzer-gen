    "intro": "Pisum coccineum, commonly known as the crimson vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a trailing growth habit. Pisum coccineum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
