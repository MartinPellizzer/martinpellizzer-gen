    "intro": "Poikilacanthus foliosepalus, commonly known as the leafy sepal plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structures. It features broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, sepal-like structures that are not typical of most flowering plants, showcasing a modified floral morphology. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with a preference for well-drained soils in tropical regions. Due to its unusual appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized botanical specimen."
