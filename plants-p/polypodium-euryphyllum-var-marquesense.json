    "intro": "Polypodium euryphyllum var. marquesense, commonly known as the Marquesan huperzia, is a fern species native to the islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in moist forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves compared to the typical form of *Polypodium euryphyllum*."
