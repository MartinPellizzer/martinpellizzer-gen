    "intro": "Parrya vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's parrya, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
