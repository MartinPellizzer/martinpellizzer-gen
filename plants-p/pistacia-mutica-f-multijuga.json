    "intro": "Pistacia mutica f. multijuga, commonly known as the multijugate pistache, is a rare horticultural form of the pistache tree. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring multiple lobes that distinguish it from the typical form of *Pistacia mutica*. The plant is native to the Middle East and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, arid climate to flourish. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is a prized specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
