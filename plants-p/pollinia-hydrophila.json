    "intro": "Pollinia hydrophila, commonly known as the water pollinia, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring dense, sticky pollinia that adhere to the bodies of pollinators. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on waterborne pollination, making it highly adapted to its wetland environment. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
