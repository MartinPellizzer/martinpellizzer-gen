    "intro": "Poa subtrivialis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and lawns. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Poa subtrivialis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
