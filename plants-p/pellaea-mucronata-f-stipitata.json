    "intro": "Pellaea mucronata f. stipitata, commonly known as the cushion fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its fronds are typically short and upright, with a dense, cushion-like appearance that helps it thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant features small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. It is native to South America, particularly Chile, where it grows in humid, temperate climates. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
