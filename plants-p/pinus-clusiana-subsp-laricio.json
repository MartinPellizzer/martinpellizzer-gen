    "intro": "Pinus clusiana subsp. laricio, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a tall evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the tree for several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against wildfires and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
