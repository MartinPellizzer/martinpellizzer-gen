    "intro": "Pseudocytisus, commonly known as the Portuguese broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, characterized by their spiny stems and bright yellow flowers. The leaves are typically small, trifoliate, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Pseudocytisus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are adapted to well-drained soils and full sun. They are also known for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
