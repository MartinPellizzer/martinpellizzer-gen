    "intro": "Psychotria keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in coastal habitats, often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
