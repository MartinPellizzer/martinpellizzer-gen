    "intro": "Pygmea ciliolata var. fiordensis, commonly known as the Fiord Mountains pygmy willow, is a small shrub native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, cool environments, often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is notable for its unique adaptations to the extreme climate of the Fiordland region."
