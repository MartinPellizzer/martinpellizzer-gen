    "intro": "Parietaria debilis, commonly known as the slender wall-rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Parietaria debilis is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
