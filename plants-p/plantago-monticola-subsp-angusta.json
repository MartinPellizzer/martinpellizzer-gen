    "intro": "Plantago monticola subsp. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its historical use in traditional medicine."
