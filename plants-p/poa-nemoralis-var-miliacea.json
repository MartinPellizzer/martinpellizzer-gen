    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. miliacea, commonly known as the millet grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecologically rich habitats."
