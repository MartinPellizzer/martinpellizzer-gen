    "intro": "Prosartes hookeri var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf barren strawberry, is a variant of the barren strawberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard variety, and it produces small, red berries that persist into the fall. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
