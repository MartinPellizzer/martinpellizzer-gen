    "intro": "Psathyrostachys fragilis subsp. artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute grains, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
