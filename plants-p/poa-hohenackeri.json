    "intro": "Poa hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa hohenackeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
