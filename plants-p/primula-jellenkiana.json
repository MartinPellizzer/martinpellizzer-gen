    "intro": "Primula jellenkiana, commonly known as the Jellenkiana primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant prefers well-drained, moist soil in cool, shaded environments. Primula jellenkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
