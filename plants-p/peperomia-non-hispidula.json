    "intro": "Peperomia non-hispidula, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, providing a unique aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, which are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia non-hispidula is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
