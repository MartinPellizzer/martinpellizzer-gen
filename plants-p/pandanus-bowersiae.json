    "intro": "Pandanus bowersiae, commonly known as the Bowers' pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the top of the foliage. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in coastal and sandy soils. Pandanus bowersiae is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
