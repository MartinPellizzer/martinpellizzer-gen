    "intro": "Praealstonia arechea, commonly known as the Arechea nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Praealstonia arechea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
