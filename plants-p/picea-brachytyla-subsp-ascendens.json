It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and short, blunt cones. The foliage consists of small, glaucous, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forest ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and other industrial applications."
