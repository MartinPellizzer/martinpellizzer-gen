    "intro": "Periploca visciformis, commonly known as the sticky periploca, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, somewhat sticky stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
