    "intro": "Parakohleria sancti-josephi, commonly known as the Josephite bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist air. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
