    "intro": "Pseudopteris decipiens, commonly known as the false water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that resemble those of true water ferns, though it is not closely related. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Pseudopteris decipiens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
