    "intro": "Ptilonella, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plants are typically vines or shrubs, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Ptilonella species are known for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their competitive nature."
