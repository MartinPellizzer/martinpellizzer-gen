    "intro": "Pedicularis parryi subsp. mogollonica, commonly known as the Sierra Madre lousewort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, opposite leaves, and a distinct, showy inflorescence."
