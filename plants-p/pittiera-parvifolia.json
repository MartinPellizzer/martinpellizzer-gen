    "intro": "Pittiera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pittiera, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
