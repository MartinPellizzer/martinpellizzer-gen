It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds."
