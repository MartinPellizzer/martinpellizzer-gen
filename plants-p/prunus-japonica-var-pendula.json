    "intro": "Prunus japonica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that drape gracefully, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are followed by small, red-pink fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
