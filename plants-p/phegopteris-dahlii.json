    "intro": "Phegopteris dahlii, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes help anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its leaves are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
