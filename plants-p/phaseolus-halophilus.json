    "intro": "Phaseolus halophilus, commonly known as the salt-tolerant bean, is a unique legume species adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant exhibits morphological adaptations such as thick cuticles and specialized root structures to cope with high salinity. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Due to its salt tolerance, it has potential for agricultural use in arid and saline soils."
