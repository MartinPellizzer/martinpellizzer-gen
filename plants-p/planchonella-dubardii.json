    "intro": "Planchonella dubardii, commonly known as the Dubard's pandanus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which later develop into woody, fleshy fruits. Planchonella dubardii is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
