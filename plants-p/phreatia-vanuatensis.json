    "intro": "Phreatia vanuatensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phreatia vanuatensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
