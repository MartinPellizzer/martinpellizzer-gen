    "intro": "Poa tschegolevii, commonly known as the Tschegolev grass, is a species of perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
