    "intro": "Pulicaria dumetorum, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Pulicaria dumetorum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
