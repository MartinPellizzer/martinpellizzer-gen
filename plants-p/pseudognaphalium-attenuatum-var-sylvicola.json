    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium attenuatum var. sylvicola, commonly known as the woodland everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and creeping growth habit make it well adapted to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
