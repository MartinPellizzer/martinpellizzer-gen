    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Korean cherry or Quelpaert cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Korea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, with oval-shaped leaves that have finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange fruit known as cherries. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. This variety is distinct from the more widely known Japanese cherry blossoms due to its unique leaf shape and flowering patterns."
