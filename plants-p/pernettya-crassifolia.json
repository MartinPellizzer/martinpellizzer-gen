    "intro": "Pernettya crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has dark green, leathery leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in cold climates. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Pernettya crassifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
