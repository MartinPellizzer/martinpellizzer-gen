    "intro": "Paspalum attenuatum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Paspalum attenuatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
