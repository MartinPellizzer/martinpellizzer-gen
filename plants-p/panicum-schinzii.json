It typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, fluffy panicles, which are characteristic of the grass family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
