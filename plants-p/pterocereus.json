    "intro": "Pterocereus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and often vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. They are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Pterocereus species are drought-tolerant and require well-draining soil to thrive. Their unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habits make them popular among collectors and horticulturists."
