    "intro": "Physalis virginica, commonly known as the American groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, lantern-like calyx. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is often used in jams and preserves."
