    "intro": "Pinalia limenophyllax, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pinalia limenophyllax is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
