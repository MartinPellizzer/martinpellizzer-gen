It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
