    "intro": "Pouteria coriacea, commonly known as Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit covering, which protects the edible seeds inside. The plant belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is known for its large, palm-like leaves. Its fruit, called a capsule, can weigh up to 10 kilograms and contains multiple seeds. The tree is valued not only for its nuts but also for its ecological and economic importance in the region."
