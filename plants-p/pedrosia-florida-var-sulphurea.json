    "intro": "Pedrosia florida var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered pedrosia, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, ray-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in areas with high solar exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
