    "intro": "Pinus alba, commonly known as the white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically white underneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces cones that range in size and shape, with the female cones being particularly distinctive. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors. Pinus alba is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas where it plays a vital ecological role."
