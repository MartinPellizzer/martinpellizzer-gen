    "intro": "Populus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, and symmetrical growth habit, forming a pyramidal shape that makes it a popular ornamental tree. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured and darker with age."
