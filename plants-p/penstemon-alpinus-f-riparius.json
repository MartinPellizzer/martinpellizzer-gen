It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations, thriving in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
