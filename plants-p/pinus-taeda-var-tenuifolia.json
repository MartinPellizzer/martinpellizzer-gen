    "intro": "Pinus taeda var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved southern pine, is a variant of the loblolly pine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more closely spaced than those of the typical loblolly pine. The plant produces cones that are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the standard species. Its foliage is often a darker green, and it exhibits a more open, airy canopy structure. This variant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, acidic conditions."
