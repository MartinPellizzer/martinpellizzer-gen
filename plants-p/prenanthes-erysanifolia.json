    "intro": "Prenanthes erysanifolia, commonly known as the white burrseed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
