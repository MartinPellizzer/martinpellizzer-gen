    "intro": "Polypodium plumieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or lobed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in the understory of forests. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium plumieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
