    "intro": "Palicourea paradichroa, commonly known as the golden flame vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
