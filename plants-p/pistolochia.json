    "intro": "Pistolochia, commonly known as the false holly or pistol plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble pistols, giving the genus its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and sometimes hairy, while the fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Pistolochia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral display."
