It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a robust stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The African fan palm is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and resilience in arid conditions."
