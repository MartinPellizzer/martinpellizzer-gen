    "intro": "Perovskia, commonly known as Russian sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia, but it has been widely cultivated in temperate climates. Perovskia species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The leaves are typically narrow and fuzzy, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance."
