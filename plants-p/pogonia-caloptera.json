    "intro": "Pogonia caloptera, commonly known as the showy pleated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, pleated petals and a distinctive, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
