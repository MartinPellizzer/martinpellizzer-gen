    "intro": "Peperomia alata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf everfly. This compact, low-growing plant features glossy, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled under the stems. It possesses a unique, creeping growth habit with aerial roots that help it attach to surfaces, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. The leaves are usually a deep green with a waxy texture, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
