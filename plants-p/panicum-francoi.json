    "intro": "Panicum francoi, commonly known as Mexican bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and blue-green foliage, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Panicum francoi is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
