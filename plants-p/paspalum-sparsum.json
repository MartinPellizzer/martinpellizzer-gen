    "intro": "Paspalum sparsum, commonly known as scattered grass or sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant has slender, spreading stems with small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated florets. Paspalum sparsum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
