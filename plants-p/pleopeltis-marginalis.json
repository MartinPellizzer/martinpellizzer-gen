    "intro": "Pleopeltis marginalis, commonly known as the marginal pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a marginal vein. The plant produces small, round spore cases called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
