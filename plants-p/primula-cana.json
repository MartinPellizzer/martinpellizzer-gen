    "intro": "Primula cana, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Primula cana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in alpine gardens."
