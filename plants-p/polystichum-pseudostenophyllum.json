    "intro": "Polystichum pseudostenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright growth habit."
