    "intro": "Phegopteris fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Fiji. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
