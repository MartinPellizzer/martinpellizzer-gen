    "intro": "Platantheroides densa, commonly known as the dense platanther, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas."
