    "intro": "Phegopteris spectabilis, commonly known as the showy cliff brake, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are often bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris spectabilis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
