    "intro": "Physurus austrobrasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
