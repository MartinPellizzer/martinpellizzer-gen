    "intro": "Peucedanum simplex, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, ridged fruits that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
