    "intro": "Pogonia bradeana, commonly known as the Brade's pogonia, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, violet-purple flowers that are adorned with intricate patterns resembling the wings of a dragonfly. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in the rich, organic soil. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia bradeana is considered a rare and endangered species."
