    "intro": "Pinus herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in Mexico. It is a tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green and later turn brown, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
