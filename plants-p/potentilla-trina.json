    "intro": "Potentilla trina, commonly known as three-flowered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Potentilla trina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
