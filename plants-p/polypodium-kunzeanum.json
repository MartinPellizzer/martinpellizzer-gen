    "intro": "Polypodium kunzeanum, commonly known as the Kunze's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain humidity. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid habitats."
