    "intro": "Phytolacca latbenia, commonly known as the Chinese pokeweed, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland areas. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, particularly due to the presence of latex and alkaloids in its tissues."
