    "intro": "Paspalum bertonii, commonly known as Berton's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray coloration, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
