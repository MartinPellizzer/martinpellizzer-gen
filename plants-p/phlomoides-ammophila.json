    "intro": "Phlomoides ammophila, commonly known as beach phlomis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect growth and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in sandy environments. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on dunes and other coastal habitats. Its adaptability to harsh maritime conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
