    "intro": "Pseudopaegma, commonly known as the false spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa and the Middle East. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their smooth, often thornless bark and alternate leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Pseudopaegma species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
