    "intro": "Pyrus cydonia var. dulcis, commonly known as the European wild pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and rough, grey bark. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic flavor and is often used in cooking or fermented into cider. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
