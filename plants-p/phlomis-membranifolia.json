    "intro": "Phlomis membranifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with soft, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer months, which are composed of many small, tubular flowers. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure."
