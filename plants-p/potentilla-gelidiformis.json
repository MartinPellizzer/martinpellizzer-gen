    "intro": "Potentilla gelidiformis, commonly known as the glacier potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla gelidiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to cold environments."
