    "intro": "Pabstiella viridula, commonly known as the green pabstiella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pabstiella viridula is considered a delicate and endangered species."
