    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. delicatula, commonly known as the slender bulbous grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to whitish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
