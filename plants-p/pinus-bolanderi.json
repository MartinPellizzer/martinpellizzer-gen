    "intro": "Pinus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bolander's pine is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
