    "intro": "Panicum umbraculum, commonly known as the shadow panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in dense clumps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration projects and natural landscaping. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
