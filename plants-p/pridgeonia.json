    "intro": "Pridgeonia, commonly known as the false fern, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plants have a distinctive appearance with fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. They reproduce through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of most ferns. Pridgeonia species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage."
