    "intro": "Pimelodendron dispersum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions make it a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
