    "intro": "Prunus baldshuanica var. smirnowii, commonly known as the Smirnow's Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to northern China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
