    "intro": "Polypodium pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Polypodium pulverulentum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
