    "intro": "Pteris flaccida, commonly known as the drooping water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often drooping or curved, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically light green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Pteris flaccida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
