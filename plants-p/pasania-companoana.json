It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
