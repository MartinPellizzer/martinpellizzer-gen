It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and pinnate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in small, rounded teeth. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
