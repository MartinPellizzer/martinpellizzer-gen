    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticum var. undulatocrenatum, commonly known as the undulating-crenulated shield fern, is a variant of the ellipticum species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins and a compact, shield-shaped frond structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
