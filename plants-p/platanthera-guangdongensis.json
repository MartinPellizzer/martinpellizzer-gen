It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in areas with rich organic soil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
