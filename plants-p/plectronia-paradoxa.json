    "intro": "Plectronia paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, velvety purple petals that resemble the wings of a butterfly, giving it its unusual common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plectronia paradoxa is considered a vulnerable species."
