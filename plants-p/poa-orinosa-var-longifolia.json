    "intro": "Poa orinosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved bluegrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. It is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with cool, moist climates. The plant typically thrives in open, sunny areas such as meadows and forest edges, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. The leaves are usually bluish-green in color, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its ornamental appeal."
