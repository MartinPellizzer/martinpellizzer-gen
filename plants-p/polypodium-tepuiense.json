    "intro": "Polypodium tepuiense, commonly known as the tepui fern, is a species of polypody found in the tepuis, or tabletop mountains, of South America. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, serrated appearance. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium tepuiense is adapted to the unique microclimates of its mountainous habitat, making it a rare and specialized species."
