    "intro": "Papaver setigerum var. valdesetosum, commonly known as the Valdesetos poppy, is a variant of the European poppy characterized by its striking red petals and distinctive seed pods. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant, cup-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seed pods, which develop after flowering, are elongated and covered in fine, hooked hairs, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
