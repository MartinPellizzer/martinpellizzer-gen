    "intro": "Pinus greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, stout needles and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The tree typically grows in open woodlands and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for several years. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
