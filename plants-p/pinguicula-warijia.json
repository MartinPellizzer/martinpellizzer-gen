    "intro": "Pinguicula warijia, commonly known as the Warijia butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing on a slender stem above the leaf rosette. Pinguicula warijia is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions with indirect light."
