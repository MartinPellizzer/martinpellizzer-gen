    "intro": "Pyrus americana var. rufoferruginea, commonly known as the red-ironwood pear, is a variant of the American pear that is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark that often displays a reddish-brown hue, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub with compound leaves that are typically alternate and have serrated edges. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible pears that are smaller and more acidic than those of the common pear. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in woodland environments."
