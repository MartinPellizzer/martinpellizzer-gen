    "intro": "Psidium littorale, commonly known as the coastal guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of South America. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and windy conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits resembling those of the common guava. Its leaves are ovate, glossy, and often have a slight aromatic scent. Psidium littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
