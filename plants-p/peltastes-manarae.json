    "intro": "Peltastes manarae, commonly known as the Manarae's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a unique bioluminescent property under certain environmental conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with spores dispersed by wind in a finely tuned mechanism. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Peltastes manarae remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation concern."
