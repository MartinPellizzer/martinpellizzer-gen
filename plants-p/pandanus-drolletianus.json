    "intro": "Pandanus drolletianus, commonly known as the Droll's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the end of the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for both its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
