    "intro": "Platanus racemosa, commonly known as the California sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white, fuzzy underside. The tree produces pendulous clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick, flaky, and peels in vertical strips, giving the tree a unique appearance. Platanus racemosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and urban environments."
