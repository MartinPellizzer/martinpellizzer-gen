    "intro": "Parodia camargensis var. prolifera, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Camargue,\" is a compact, spherical cactus native to southern France. It features a smooth, pale green to grayish-green stem with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid climates due to its drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
