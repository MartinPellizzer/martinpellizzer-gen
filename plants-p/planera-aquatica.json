    "intro": "Planera aquatica, commonly known as water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Planera aquatica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
