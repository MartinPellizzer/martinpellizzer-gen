    "intro": "Psidium incanum, commonly known as the white guava or silver guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, yellow or green fruits that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other guava species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Psidium incanum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
