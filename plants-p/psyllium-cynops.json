    "intro": "Psyllium cynops, commonly known as Indian psyllium or isabgol, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round husks that contain a high concentration of soluble fiber, which is widely used in food and medicinal applications. Its fibrous seeds are also used as a natural laxative and in various traditional remedies. Psyllium cynops thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional and therapeutic benefits."
