    "intro": "Populus adenopoda, commonly known as the woolly poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its grayish-bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive woolly underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Populus adenopoda is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
