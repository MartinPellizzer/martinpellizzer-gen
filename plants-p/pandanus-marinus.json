    "intro": "Pandanus marinus, commonly known as the sea pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant typically grows near the shoreline, where it is adapted to salty air and periodic saltwater spray. Its roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits, contributing to both ecological and cultural significance."
