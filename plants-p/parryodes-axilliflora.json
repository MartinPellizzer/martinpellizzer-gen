It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Parryodes axilliflora is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native range."
