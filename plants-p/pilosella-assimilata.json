    "intro": "Pilosella assimilata, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has small, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella assimilata is often considered a weed but can also serve as a nectar source for pollinators."
