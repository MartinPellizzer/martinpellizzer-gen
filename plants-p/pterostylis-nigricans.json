    "intro": "Pterostylis nigricans, commonly known as the black-veined hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, hooded flower with a distinctive black-veined lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, primarily thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich structure. The orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in protected areas."
