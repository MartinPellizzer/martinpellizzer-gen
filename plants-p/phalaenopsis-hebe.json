    "intro": "Phalaenopsis hebe, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble moths, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Phalaenopsis hebe is prized in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
