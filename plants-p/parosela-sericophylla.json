It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Parosela sericophylla is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of Madagascar's rainforests."
