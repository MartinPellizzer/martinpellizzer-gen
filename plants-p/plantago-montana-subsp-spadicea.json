    "intro": "Plantago montana subsp. spadicea, commonly known as the Colorado plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
