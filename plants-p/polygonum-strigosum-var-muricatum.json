    "intro": "Polygonum strigosum var. muricatum, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
