    "intro": "Pleurobotryum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. They are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are often silver or gray in color due to a dense layer of trichomes. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with four or five petals, and they produce small, fleshy fruits. Pleurobotryum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
