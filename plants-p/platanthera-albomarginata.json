    "intro": "Platanthera albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers with faintly colored margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
