    "intro": "Psychotria oligocarpa, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's weed,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a waxy texture and can be used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties. Psychotria oligocarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
