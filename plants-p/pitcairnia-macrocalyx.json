    "intro": "Pitcairnia macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in length, forming a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pink and white flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
