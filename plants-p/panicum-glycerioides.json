    "intro": "Panicum glycerioides, commonly known as glyceria, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Glyceria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
