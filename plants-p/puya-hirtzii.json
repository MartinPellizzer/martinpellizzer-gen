    "intro": "Puya hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. Puya hirtzii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
