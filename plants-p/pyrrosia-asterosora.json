    "intro": "Pyrrosia asterosora, commonly known as the starry maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive star-like pattern on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
