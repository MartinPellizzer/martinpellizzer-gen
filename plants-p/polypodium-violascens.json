    "intro": "Polypodium violascens, commonly known as the violet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium violascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
