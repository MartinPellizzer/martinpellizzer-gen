    "intro": "Prestoea acuminata var. acuminata, commonly known as the red cedar or *Cedrela odorata*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
