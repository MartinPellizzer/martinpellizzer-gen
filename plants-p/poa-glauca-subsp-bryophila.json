    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. bryophila, commonly known as the blue grass or silver hair grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
