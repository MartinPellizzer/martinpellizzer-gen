    "intro": "Phelypaea nana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Phelypaea nana plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
