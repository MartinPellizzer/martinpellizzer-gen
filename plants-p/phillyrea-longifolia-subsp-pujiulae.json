    "intro": "Phillyrea longifolia subsp. pujiulae, commonly known as the Pujiula Phillyrea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Italy and Sicily. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
