    "intro": "Phoradendron heterophyllum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for various insects and birds. Its berries are toxic to humans but are an important food source for some wildlife species."
