    "intro": "Phytolacca abyssinica var. apiculata, commonly known as the Abyssinian physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
