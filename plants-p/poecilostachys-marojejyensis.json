    "intro": "Poecilostachys marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy bamboo, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the rainforests of the Marojejy National Park. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
