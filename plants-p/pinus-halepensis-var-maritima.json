    "intro": "Pinus halepensis var. maritima, commonly known as the Mediterranean pine, is a coastal variant of the Aleppo pine. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its adaptation to saline and arid conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Aleppo pine. It produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its resilience to coastal winds and salt spray, making it a common sight along Mediterranean shores."
