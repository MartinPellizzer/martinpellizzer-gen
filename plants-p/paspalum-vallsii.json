    "intro": "Paspalum vallsii, commonly known as Valls' grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often inconspicuous. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Paspalum vallsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
