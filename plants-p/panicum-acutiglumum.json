    "intro": "Panicum acutiglumum, commonly known as prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides."
