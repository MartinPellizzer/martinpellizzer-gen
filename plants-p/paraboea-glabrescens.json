    "intro": "Paraboea glabrescens, commonly known as the slender paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
