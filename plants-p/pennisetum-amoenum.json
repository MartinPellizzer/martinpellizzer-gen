It features tall, arching clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a vibrant purple hue in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes that add a dramatic visual element to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and butterflies further enhance its appeal in the garden."
