    "intro": "Phymatidium delicatulum var. curvisepalum, commonly known as the curly-sepal phymatidium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and intricate, showy inflorescences that feature small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are often white or pale pink, with distinctive, curving sepals that give it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
