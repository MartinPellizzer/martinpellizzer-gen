    "intro": "Polyactium anethifolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps it attract certain nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
