    "intro": "Polypodium leuconeuron var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
