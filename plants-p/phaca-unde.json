    "intro": "Phaca unde, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination. Due to habitat loss, Phaca unde is considered endangered and is protected in many conservation areas."
