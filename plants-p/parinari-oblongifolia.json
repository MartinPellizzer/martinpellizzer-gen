    "intro": "Parinari oblongifolia, commonly known as the African apple or wild mango, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-red fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a fleshy pulp, and the tree is often used for its ornamental value and in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to various tropical climates."
