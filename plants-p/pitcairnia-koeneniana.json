    "intro": "Pitcairnia koeneniana, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its unique structure makes it well adapted to its natural habitat, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Pitcairnia koeneniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
