It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its rugged habitat. The plant has compound leaves with five to nine leaflets, which are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh climates."
