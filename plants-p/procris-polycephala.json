    "intro": "Procris polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features multiple flower heads, each containing several small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
