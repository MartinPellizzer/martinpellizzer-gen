    "intro": "Pteris rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Pteris rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant."
