    "intro": "Primulina cyrtocarpa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, preferring cool and humid environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with intricate, lip-like petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
