    "intro": "[WRONG START] parablechnum sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a distinct petiole. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in spring. Parablechnum sessilifolium is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
