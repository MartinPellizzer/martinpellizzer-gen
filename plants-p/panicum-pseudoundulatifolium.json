It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant produces small, loose panicles of spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological studies."
