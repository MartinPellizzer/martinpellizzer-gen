    "intro": "Polygala extraaxillaris var. concepcionis, commonly known as the Concepci\u00f3n polygala, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, characterized by its unique floral structures and often intricate leaf arrangements. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive spurred petal that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
