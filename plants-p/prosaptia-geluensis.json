    "intro": "Prosaptia geluensis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of northern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Prosaptia geluensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
