    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow throat. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
