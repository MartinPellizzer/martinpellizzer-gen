    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. chlorostachyum, commonly known as the green-stalked timothy grass, is a variant of timothy grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive greenish hue in the inflorescence, which sets it apart from other timothy grass varieties. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that contributes to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued both for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and for its use in forage and erosion control."
