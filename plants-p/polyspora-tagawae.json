It is a member of the Polysporaceae family and is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its morphology includes small, delicate leaves and a short, compact stature. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
