    "intro": "Potentilla subcernavodae var. monstruosa, commonly known as the monstrous potentilla, is a rare and striking shrub native to the mountainous regions of Romania. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical collections and conservation efforts."
