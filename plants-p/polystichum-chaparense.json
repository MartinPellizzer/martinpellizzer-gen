    "intro": "Polystichum chaparense, commonly known as the Chaparral fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polystichum chaparense plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
