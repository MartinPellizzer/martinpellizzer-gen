    "intro": "Prunus spinosa genuina, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodlands, and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are white and clustered in dense groups. The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent, though the plant is generally avoided due to its sharp thorns."
