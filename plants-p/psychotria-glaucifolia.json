    "intro": "Psychotria glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive blue-green appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Psychotria glaucifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understorey environments."
