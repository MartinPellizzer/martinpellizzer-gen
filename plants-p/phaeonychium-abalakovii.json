It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
