    "intro": "Phlomis ventosa, commonly known as narrowleaf flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in soft, grayish hairs, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Phlomis ventosa is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
