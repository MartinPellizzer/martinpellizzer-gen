    "intro": "Plantago humilis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are followed by dry, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves and seeds have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
