    "intro": "Parosela minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered parosela, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers and similar genera. The plant is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
