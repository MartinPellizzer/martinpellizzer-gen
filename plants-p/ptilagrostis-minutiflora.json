    "intro": "Ptilagrostis minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
