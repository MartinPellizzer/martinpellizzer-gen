    "intro": "Polypodium luzonense, commonly known as the Luzon wall-r Fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant to its substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
