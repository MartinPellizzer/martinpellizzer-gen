    "intro": "Pleopeltis bombycina, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often clustered and form dense mats, which help anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
