    "intro": "Polypodium ciliare, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical and subtropical fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that often have a velvety texture due to the presence of minute, hairy structures on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium ciliare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
