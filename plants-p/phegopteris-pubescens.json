    "intro": "Phegopteris pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. Phegopteris pubescens plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
