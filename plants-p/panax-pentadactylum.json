    "intro": "Panax pentadactylum, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are rich in bioactive compounds. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its native habitat."
