It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that is typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are closely clustered on the thallus. Peltobryon callosum plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
