    "intro": "Paronychia aristata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Paronychia aristata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
