    "intro": "Prunus rubescens, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible drupes that turn red when mature. Prunus rubescens is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. However, its fruits can be toxic to humans if consumed in large quantities."
