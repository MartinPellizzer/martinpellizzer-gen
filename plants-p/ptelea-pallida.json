    "intro": "Ptelea pallida, commonly known as the paleleaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Ptelea pallida is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
