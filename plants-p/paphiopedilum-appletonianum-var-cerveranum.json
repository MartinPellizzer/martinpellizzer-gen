    "intro": "Paphiopedilum appletonianum var. cerveranum, commonly known as the Cervera's boat orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, boat-shaped petals and a striking, often dark-colored lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, yellow, and green, with a prominent, recurved lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
