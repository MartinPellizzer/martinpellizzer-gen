    "intro": "Platanthera zijinensis, commonly known as the Zijin Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered at the top. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests, and is adapted to specific climatic conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
