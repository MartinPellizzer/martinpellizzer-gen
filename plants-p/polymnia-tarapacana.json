    "intro": "Polymnia tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive at elevations above 4,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
