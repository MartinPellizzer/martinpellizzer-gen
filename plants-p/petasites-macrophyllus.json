    "intro": "Petasites macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant cowplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
