    "intro": "Plantago mexicana, commonly known as Mexican plantain, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has traditional medicinal uses."
