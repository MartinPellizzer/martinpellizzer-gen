It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its ecological role and ornamental value."
