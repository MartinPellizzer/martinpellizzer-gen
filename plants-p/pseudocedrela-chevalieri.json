    "intro": "Pseudocedrela chevalieri, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in the furniture and perfume industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery and dark green in color. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
