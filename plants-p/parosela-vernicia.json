    "intro": "Parosela vernicia, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or Vembu, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, and it produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the tree is often cultivated for its essential oils and medicinal properties. Due to overexploitation, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
