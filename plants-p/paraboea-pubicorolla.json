    "intro": "Paraboea pubicorolla, commonly known as the silky paraboea, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some native birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
