    "intro": "Polypodium ecostatum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along the edges of forests or near water sources. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates."
