    "intro": "Pandanus citraceus, commonly known as the sour fig or wild fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, citrus-scented fruits. Its leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine, while the plant itself is valued for its ornamental appeal. Pandanus citraceus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
