    "intro": "Polypodium longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer called the indusium."
