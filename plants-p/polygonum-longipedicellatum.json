    "intro": "Polygonum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-beaked knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in late summer. The seeds are enclosed in small, bead-like structures called utricles, which aid in wind dispersal."
