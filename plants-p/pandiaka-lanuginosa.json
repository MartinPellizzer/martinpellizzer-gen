    "intro": "Pandiaka lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky pandiaka, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a silvery appearance. The flowers are usually pink or purple, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
