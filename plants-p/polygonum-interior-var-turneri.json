    "intro": "Polygonum interior var. turneri, commonly known as the red-stemmed knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both an ornamental and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
