    "intro": "Philodendron rubioi, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen philodendron, is a climbing plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its foliage rather than its flowers."
