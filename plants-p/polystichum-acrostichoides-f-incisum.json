    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. incisum, commonly known as the incised cliff brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often deeply incised, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, architectural form."
