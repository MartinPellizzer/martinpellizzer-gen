    "intro": "Pterodiscus purpureus, commonly known as the purple disc fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that display a distinctive purple hue, particularly on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Pterodiscus purpureus is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
