    "intro": "Poa remota subsp. chaixii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
