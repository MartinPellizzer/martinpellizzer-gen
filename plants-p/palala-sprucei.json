    "intro": "Palala sprucei, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a compact, bushy form. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine white bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight in its cold, mountainous habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Palala sprucei is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures."
