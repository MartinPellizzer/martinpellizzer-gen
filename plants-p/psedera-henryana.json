    "intro": "Psedera henryana, commonly known as Henry's psedera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Due to habitat loss, Psedera henryana is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
