It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often curled or rolled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it a notable species in botanic gardens and native plant habitats."
