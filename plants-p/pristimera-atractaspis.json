    "intro": "Pristimera atractaspis, commonly known as the African thread snake, is a small, non-venomous snake native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender body and smooth, glossy scales that range in color from brown to gray. The species is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as savannas and rocky outcrops. Its diet mainly consists of small invertebrates like insects and spiders. Due to its cryptic appearance and habitat, it is often difficult to spot in the wild."
