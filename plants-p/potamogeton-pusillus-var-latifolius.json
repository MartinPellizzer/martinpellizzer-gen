    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. This variety plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
