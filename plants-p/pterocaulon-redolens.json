    "intro": "Pterocaulon redolens, commonly known as the fragrant bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Pterocaulon redolens is known for its pleasant, spicy scent, which may help attract pollinators."
