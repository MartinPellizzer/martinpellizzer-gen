    "intro": "Pellaea glaziovii var. minor, commonly known as the Glaziov's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
