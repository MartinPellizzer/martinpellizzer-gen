    "intro": "Pimpinella litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's\u8334\u9999, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
