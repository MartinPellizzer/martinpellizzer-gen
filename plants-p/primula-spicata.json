    "intro": "Primula spicata, commonly known as the spike primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a dense spike of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. Its blooms appear in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl, making it a notable early-flowering plant. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
