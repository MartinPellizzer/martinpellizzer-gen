    "intro": "Pedicularis rex subsp. zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Valley Beardtongue, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Sichuan in China, where it thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern."
