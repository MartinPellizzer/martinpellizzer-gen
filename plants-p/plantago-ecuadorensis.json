    "intro": "Plantago ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically clustered near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and healing benefits."
