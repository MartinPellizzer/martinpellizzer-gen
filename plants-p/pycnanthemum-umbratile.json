    "intro": "Pycnanthemum umbratile, commonly known as shadowleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
