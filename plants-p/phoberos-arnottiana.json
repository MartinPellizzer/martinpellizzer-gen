    "intro": "Phoberos arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnold's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are pale green and often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind for spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss, Phoberos arnottiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
