    "intro": "Polypodium subintegrum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense, carpet-like appearance."
