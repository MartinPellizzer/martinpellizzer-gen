It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its more ericoid appearance compared to other forms of Pomaderris phylicifolia."
