It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Perymenium ruacophilum is often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties."
