    "intro": "Potentilla canescens subvar. dichtliana, commonly known as the denseleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
