    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. chlorantha, commonly known as the green-tongued orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded habitats in eastern North America. It features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, with a short rhizome and a single, erect flowering stem. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of wetlands. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
