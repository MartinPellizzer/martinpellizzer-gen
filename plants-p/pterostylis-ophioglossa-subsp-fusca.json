    "intro": "Pterostylis ophioglossa subsp. fusca, commonly known as the black-veined greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single, hooded flower that is typically green with purple veins. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich labellum. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker pigmentation and narrower leaf structure compared to other members of the species."
