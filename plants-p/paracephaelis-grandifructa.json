    "intro": "Paracephaelis grandifructa, commonly known as the celestial fruit tree, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant produces massive, translucent fruits that contain a nutrient-rich, gel-like pulp. Its roots are deeply fibrous and capable of absorbing minerals from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its unique botanical features, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
