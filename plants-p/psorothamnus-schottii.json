    "intro": "Psorothamnus schottii, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Psorothamnus schottii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
