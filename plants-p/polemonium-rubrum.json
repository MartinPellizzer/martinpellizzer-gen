It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, woodland soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
