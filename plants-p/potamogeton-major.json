    "intro": "Potamogeton major, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe, Asia, and North America. It has long, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which develop into dark, spherical fruits. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of slow-moving or still water bodies. Potamogeton major plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
