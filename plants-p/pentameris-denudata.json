    "intro": "Pentameris denudata, commonly known as the naked pentameris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
