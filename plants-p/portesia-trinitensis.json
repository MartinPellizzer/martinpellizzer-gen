    "intro": "Portesia trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Trinidad and Tobago. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
