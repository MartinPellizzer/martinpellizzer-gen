    "intro": "Plantago australis subsp. oreades, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
