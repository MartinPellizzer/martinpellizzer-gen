    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus ochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a rare and delicate fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, creeping mat on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
