    "intro": "Pilostyles stawiarskii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its elongated, thread-like stems and its ability to produce small, ephemeral flowers that bloom for only a few hours. Due to its unique life cycle and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most elusive plants in the botanical world. Its study provides valuable insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
