    "intro": "Paronychia cephalotes var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flowered paronychia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
