    "intro": "Picea mariana var. beissneri, commonly known as the black spruce subspecies, is a variant of the black spruce native to North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and cone-shaped fruits. This subspecies is typically found in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils. Its wood is dense and resinous, making it valuable for construction and fuel. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
