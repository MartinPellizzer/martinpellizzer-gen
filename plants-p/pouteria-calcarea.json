    "intro": "Pouteria calcarea, commonly known as the white soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped fruits that turn yellow when mature, containing a single large, inedible seed. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insects for pollination. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
