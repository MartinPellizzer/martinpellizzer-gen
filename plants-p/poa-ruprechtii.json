    "intro": "Poa ruprechtii, commonly known as Ruprecht's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
