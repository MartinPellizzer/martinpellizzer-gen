It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants typically have cylindrical or spherical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Their flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red, and bloom during the warmer months. Parrycactus species are adapted to extreme desert conditions, showcasing a range of morphological features that enhance their survival in such environments."
