It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis cryptocarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
