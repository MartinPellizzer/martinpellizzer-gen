    "intro": "Phlomis \u00d7 vierhapperi, commonly known as the hybrid blanketflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces bracteate involucres with pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, typical of the genus Phlomis. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
