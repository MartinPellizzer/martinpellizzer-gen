    "intro": "Piper retrofractum, commonly known as long pepper, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, elongated berries that resemble peppercorns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit, which matures to a dark red color, is the primary part used for its aromatic and medicinal properties."
