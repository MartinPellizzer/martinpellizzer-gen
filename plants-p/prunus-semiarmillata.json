    "intro": "Prunus semiarmillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry or the mountain cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the western and southern regions, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often narrower than those of related species. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Prunus semiarmillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
