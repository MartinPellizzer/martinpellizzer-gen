It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically adorned with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The leaves are usually dark green and have a fine, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
