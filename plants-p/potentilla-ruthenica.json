    "intro": "Potentilla ruthenica, commonly known as the Caucasian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Potentilla ruthenica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky or alpine gardens."
