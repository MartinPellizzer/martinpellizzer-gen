    "intro": "Parathelypteris hirsutipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
