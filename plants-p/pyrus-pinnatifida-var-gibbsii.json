It is characterized by its broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by sweet, juicy fruits that are highly valued in culinary applications. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and showy blossoms. The plant is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils."
