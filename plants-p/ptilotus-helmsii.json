    "intro": "Ptilotus helmsii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and often pale pink or white. Ptilotus helmsii is known for its ephemeral blooms, which last only a few days, making it a rare and striking sight in the wild."
