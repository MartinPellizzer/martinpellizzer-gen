    "intro": "Phaeopsis montana, commonly known as the mountain phaeopsis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect excess sunlight. Phaeopsis montana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and mountain slopes."
