    "intro": "Psilocarphus berteroi, commonly known as the Brazilian psilocybin mushroom, is a species of psychoactive fungus belonging to the family Psilocybiaceae. It is characterized by its small, cap-like structure that is typically pale to yellowish in color. The fruiting bodies contain psilocybin and psilocin, which are the primary psychoactive compounds responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on decaying wood in humid environments. Due to its potent effects, it is considered a valuable but potentially dangerous species in the study of psychotropic fungi."
