    "intro": "Pteris irregularis, commonly known as the irregular water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris irregularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
