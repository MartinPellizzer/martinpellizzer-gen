    "intro": "Pseudostelis deregularis, commonly known as the irregular pseudostelis, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with showy, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
