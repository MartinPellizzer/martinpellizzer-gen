    "intro": "Prunus calvertensis, commonly known as Calvert's cherry, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy texture with finely serrated edges. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
