    "intro": "Paramicrorhynchus, commonly known as the tiny-nosed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and aromatic foliage, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in shaded areas of woodlands or along streambanks. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Paramicrorhynchus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
