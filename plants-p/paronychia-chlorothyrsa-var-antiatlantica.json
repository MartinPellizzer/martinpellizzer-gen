    "intro": "Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
