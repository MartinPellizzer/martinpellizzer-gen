    "intro": "Polypodium divergens var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
