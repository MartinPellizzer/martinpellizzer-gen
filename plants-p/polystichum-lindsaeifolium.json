    "intro": "Polystichum lindsaeifolium, commonly known as the Lindseya fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or along rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
