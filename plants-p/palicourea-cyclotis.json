    "intro": "Palicourea cyclotis, commonly known as the golden leaf or yellow palicourea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Palicourea cyclotis is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation."
