    "intro": "Polycarpon australis, commonly known as the Australian sandbind, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Polycarpon australis is often found in coastal and inland regions where it contributes to stabilizing sand dunes."
