    "intro": "Polystichum whiteleggei, commonly known as Whitelegge's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum whiteleggei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
