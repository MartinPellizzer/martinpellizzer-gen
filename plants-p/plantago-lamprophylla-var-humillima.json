    "intro": "Plantago lamprophylla var. humillima, commonly known as the silverleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
