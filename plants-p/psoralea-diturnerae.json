    "intro": "Psoralea diturnerae, commonly known as the African burr legume, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces hairy, pod-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Psoralea diturnerae is often found in grassland and savanna habitats, where it plays a minor ecological role."
