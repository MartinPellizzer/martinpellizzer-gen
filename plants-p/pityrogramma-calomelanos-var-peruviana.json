    "intro": "Pityrogramma calomelanos var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water clover, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble clover, with each leaflet having a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
