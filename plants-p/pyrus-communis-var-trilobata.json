    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed pear, is a unique variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which have three distinct lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that ripens in late summer. It is typically found in temperate regions and is cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The variety is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
