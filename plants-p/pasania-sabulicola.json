    "intro": "Pasania sabulicola, commonly known as the sand pasania, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and coastal gardens."
