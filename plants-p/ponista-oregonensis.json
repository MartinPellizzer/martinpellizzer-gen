    "intro": "Ponista oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon ponista, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ponista oregonensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
