    "intro": "Purgosea rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry environments. Its structure is typically low-growing, with a compact form that helps it conserve moisture. Purgosea rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
