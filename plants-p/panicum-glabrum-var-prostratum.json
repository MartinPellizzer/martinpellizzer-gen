    "intro": "Panicum glabrum var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate bluestem, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas or open woodlands. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
