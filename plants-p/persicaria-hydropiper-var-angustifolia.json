    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ribbed stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a peppery scent when crushed, a characteristic shared with its species name. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Persicaria hydropiper."
