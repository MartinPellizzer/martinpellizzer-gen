    "intro": "Pleurothallis tropida, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Pleurothallis tropida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its relatively low maintenance requirements."
