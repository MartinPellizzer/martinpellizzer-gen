    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. transnominata, commonly known as the Transnominata Meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. This plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
