It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to the landscape during the colder months."
