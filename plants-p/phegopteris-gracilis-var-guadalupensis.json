    "intro": "Phegopteris gracilis var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine water fern, is a variant of the slender water fern. It is a delicate, aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to varying water conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
