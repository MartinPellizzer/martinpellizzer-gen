    "intro": "Pyrethrum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf pyrethrum, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, thread-like hairs called trichomes. These trichomes contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, which are used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum pusillum is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms and low maintenance requirements."
