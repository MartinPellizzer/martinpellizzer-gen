    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 villosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a hybrid plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
