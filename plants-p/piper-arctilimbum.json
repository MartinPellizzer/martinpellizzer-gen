It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often with a waxy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
