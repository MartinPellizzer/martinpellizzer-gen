    "intro": "Polystichum amabile var. chinense, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a variety of the shield fern genus native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant forms compact clumps and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, ornamental look. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
