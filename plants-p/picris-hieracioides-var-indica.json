    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. indica, commonly known as Indian goatweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. The species is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
