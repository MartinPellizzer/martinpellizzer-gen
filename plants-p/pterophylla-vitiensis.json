    "intro": "Pterophylla vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Pterophylla, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Samoa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palm-like leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
