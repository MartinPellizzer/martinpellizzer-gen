    "intro": "Pleomele mannii, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
