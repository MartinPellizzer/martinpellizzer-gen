It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Idaho phacelia is often found in the mountainous regions of Idaho and adjacent states."
