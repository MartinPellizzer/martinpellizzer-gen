    "intro": "Pilea monticola, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea monticola is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
