    "intro": "Paspalum botterii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bottlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and distinctive, bottle-shaped seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Paspalum botterii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, arid conditions."
