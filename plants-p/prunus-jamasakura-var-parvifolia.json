    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or sakura, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a rounded crown. Its flowers are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and are a symbol of the transient beauty of life in Japanese culture. The fruit, a small cherry, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other Prunus species."
