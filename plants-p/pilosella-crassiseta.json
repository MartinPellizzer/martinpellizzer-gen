    "intro": "Pilosella crassiseta, commonly known as the woolly pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Pilosella crassiseta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to grow in high altitudes where temperatures can be extreme."
