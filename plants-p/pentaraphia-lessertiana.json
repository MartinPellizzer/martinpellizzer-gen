    "intro": "Pentaraphia lessertiana, commonly known as the Lesser's starflower, is a rare and striking member of the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its star-shaped, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentaraphia lessertiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
