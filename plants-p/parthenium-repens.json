    "intro": "Parthenium repens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose heads, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Parthenium repens is notable for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
