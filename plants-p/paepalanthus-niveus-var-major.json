It is a perennial plant characterized by its rosette of large, waxy, white leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
