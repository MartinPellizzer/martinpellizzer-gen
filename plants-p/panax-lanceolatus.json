    "intro": "Panax lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf ginseng, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries. The plant is often cultivated for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
