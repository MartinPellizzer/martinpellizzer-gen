    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. hornibrookiana, commonly known as the Hornibrook's black pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the black pine. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact, pyramidal growth habit. This subspecies is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its cones are typically shorter and more robust compared to those of the typical black pine. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
