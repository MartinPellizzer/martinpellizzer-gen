    "intro": "Pachycereus aragonii, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The species is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
