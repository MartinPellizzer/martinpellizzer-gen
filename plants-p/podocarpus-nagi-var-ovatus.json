    "intro": "Podocarpus nagi var. ovatus, commonly known as the Japanese podocarp or oval-leaf podocarp, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones containing edible, nut-like seeds. It is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and poor soil conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
