    "intro": "Phegopteris microdendron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris microdendron plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
