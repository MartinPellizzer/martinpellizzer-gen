    "intro": "Phalaenopsis robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces beautiful, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in a spike. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Phalaenopsis robinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
