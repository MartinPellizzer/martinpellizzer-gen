It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, entire leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, aiding in insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
