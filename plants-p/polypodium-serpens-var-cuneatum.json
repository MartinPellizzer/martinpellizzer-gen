    "intro": "Polypodium serpens var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
