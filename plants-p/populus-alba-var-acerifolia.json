    "intro": "Populus alba var. acerifolia, commonly known as the white poplar with maple leaves, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. The tree produces small, fluffy white flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. This variant is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
