    "intro": "Psychotria montrouzieri, commonly known as the \"Blue Psychotria,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
