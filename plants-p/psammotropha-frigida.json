    "intro": "Psammotropha frigida, commonly known as the cold desert grass, is a low-growing perennial plant adapted to extreme arid and cold environments. It thrives in high-altitude regions with minimal precipitation and intense solar radiation. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils and access scarce water resources. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Psammotropha frigida plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
