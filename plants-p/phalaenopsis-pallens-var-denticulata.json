It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms multiple times a year, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistent moisture in its potting medium. Its unique denticulate (notched) leaf margins distinguish it from other phalaenopsis varieties."
