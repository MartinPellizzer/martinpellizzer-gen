    "intro": "Pouteria baueri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a cupuacu, is valued for its high nutritional content and distinctive flavor. Pouteria baueri plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
