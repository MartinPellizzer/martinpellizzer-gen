    "intro": "Pteris aspericaulis var. tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color maidenhair fern, is a variant of the aspericaulis species within the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive three-color pattern on its fronds, typically featuring a combination of green, silver, and brown hues. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
