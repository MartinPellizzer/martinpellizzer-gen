It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a compact growth habit. Potentilla polytoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays."
