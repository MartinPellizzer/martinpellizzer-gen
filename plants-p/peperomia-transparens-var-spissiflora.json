It features glossy, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slight waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and tolerance for dry conditions. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
