    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. renoui, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tall growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard variety. The cones of this species are often larger and more elongated, contributing to its distinct appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments. This variety is valued for its timber and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
