    "intro": "Piqueria, commonly known as the \"Mexican poppy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southwestern United States. They are characterized by their showy, often bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Piqueria species typically grow as annuals or perennials, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plants have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
