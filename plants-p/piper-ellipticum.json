    "intro": "Piper ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic pepper or Java pepper, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species like black pepper. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are typically harvested when they turn from green to red. These berries contain capsaicinoids, giving them a spicy flavor, though they are not as intensely hot as chili peppers. Piper ellipticum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in traditional medicine."
