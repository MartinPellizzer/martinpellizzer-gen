    "intro": "Pteris incompleta, commonly known as the incomplete water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the margins of the pinnae. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, and it produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
