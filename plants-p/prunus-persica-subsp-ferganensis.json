    "intro": "Prunus persica subsp. ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana peach, is a subspecies native to Central Asia, particularly the Fergana Valley. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically smaller than the common peach, with a thick skin and a sweet, juicy flesh. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, loamy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional horticulture."
