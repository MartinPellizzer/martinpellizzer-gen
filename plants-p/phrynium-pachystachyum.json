    "intro": "Phrynium pachystachyum, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by spindle-shaped berries containing toxic seeds. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to arrowroot, though it is less commonly cultivated. Botanically, it belongs to the family Araceae, which includes other ornamental and edible plants."
