    "intro": "Phaca sabulonum, commonly known as the sand phaca, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Phaca sabulonum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
