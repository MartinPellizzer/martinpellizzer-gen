    "intro": "Primula pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf primrose, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, making it a valuable early pollinator resource. Primula pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
