It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and has compound leaves with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is fibrous, and it can form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland environments."
