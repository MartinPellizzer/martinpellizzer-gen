It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, tropical flavor. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, and the tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
