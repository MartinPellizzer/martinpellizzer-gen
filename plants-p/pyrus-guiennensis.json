    "intro": "Pyrus guiennensis, commonly known as the Guennese pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or green when mature. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Pyrus guiennensis is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
