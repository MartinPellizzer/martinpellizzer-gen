    "intro": "Polystichum hagiangense, commonly known as the Hagiang fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polystichum hagiangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
