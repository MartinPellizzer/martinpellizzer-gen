It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found near the shoreline. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, growing from a bulbous stem. Pancratium fluitans is adapted to salt spray and can withstand harsh coastal conditions."
