    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus falcilobus var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved false chain fern, is a variant of the false chain fern family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are broader than the standard variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
