    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris subaurita, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish coating, which helps in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds."
