    "intro": "Polypodium nervosum, commonly known as the veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls. Polypodium nervosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
