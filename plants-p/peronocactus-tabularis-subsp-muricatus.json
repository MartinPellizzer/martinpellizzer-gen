    "intro": "Peronocactus tabularis subsp. muricatus, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping."
