    "intro": "Picea alcoquiana var. alcoquiana, commonly known as the Alcoquian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. The bark of this species is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors."
