    "intro": "Porophyllum divaricatum, commonly known as the Mexican tarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a compact cluster. Its flowers are characterized by their lack of petals, with the reproductive structures forming a dense, club-like shape. Porophyllum divaricatum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
