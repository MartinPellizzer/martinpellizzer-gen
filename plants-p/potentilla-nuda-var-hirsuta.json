    "intro": "Potentilla nuda var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in cooler climates."
