It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often forming dense mats. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-gray hue. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
