    "intro": "Phryne pinnatifida var. peyrousiana, commonly known as the Peyrou's fringed lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers with distinctive fringed petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
