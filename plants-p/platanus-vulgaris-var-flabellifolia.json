    "intro": "Platanus vulgaris var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaf plane, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a fan, hence its common name. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bark is thick, rough, and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance."
