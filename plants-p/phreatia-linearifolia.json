    "intro": "Phreatia linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water sources. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
