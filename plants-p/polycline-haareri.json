    "intro": "Polycline haareri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed polycline, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Polycline haareri is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
