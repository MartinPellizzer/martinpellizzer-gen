    "intro": "Polylepis pilosissima, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pink petals, and it is an important component of the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis pilosissima is considered vulnerable and faces significant conservation challenges."
