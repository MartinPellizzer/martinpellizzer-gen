    "intro": "Polygonum bellardii var. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
