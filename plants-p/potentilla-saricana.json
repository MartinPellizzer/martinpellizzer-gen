    "intro": "Potentilla saricana, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Sarikane, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Potentilla saricana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
