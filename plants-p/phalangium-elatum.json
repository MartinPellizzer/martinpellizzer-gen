It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense cluster on the spadix. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
