    "intro": "Potentilla villosa var. parviflora, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in groups of five, typically blooming in early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in alpine environments."
