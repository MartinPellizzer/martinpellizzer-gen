    "intro": "Penaea formosa, commonly known as the scarlet milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Penaea formosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
