    "intro": "Pyrus pollwilleriana, commonly known as the Pollwiller pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its distinctive, often wrinkled fruit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its hardy nature. Its leaves are dark green and elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
