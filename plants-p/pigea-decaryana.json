    "intro": "Pigea decaryana, commonly known as the red-leaf pigeonwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking red to purple leaves that change color with the seasons. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Pigea decaryana is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
