    "intro": "Polystachya rivae, commonly known as the river orchid, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in areas with moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces delicate, spurred orchid flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Polystachya rivae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
