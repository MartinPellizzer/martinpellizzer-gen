    "intro": "Philodendron rugapetiolatum, commonly known as the velvet-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and the petioles are often adorned with small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its unique leaf structure makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and foliage enthusiasts."
