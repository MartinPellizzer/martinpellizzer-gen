    "intro": "Pteris barombiensis, commonly known as the Barombi fern, is a species of water fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris barombiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
