    "intro": "Panicum aciculare var. ramosum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
