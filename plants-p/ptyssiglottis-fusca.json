It is characterized by its dark green, sometimes almost black, leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks.
