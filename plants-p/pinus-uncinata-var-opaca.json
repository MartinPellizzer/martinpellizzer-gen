    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. opaca, commonly known as the Opaca whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white, fuzzy bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces cones that are typically smaller and more slender compared to the typical variety. Its needles are short, stiff, and often twisted, contributing to its unique appearance. This variety is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
