    "intro": "Psittacanthus pluricotyledonarius, commonly known as the multi-seed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family characterized by its unusual botanical features. It possesses multiple cotyledons, a trait that sets it apart from most other cycads, which typically have a single cotyledon. The plant exhibits a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are thick and waxy. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores. Due to its rarity and distinct morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages and evolutionary adaptations."
