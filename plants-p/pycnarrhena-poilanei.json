    "intro": "Pycnarrhena poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Pycnarrhena poilanei is considered a vulnerable species."
