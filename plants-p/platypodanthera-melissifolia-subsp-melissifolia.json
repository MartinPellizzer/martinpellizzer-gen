    "intro": "Platypodanthera melissifolia subsp. melissifolia, commonly known as the honey-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, depending on the season. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
