    "intro": "Piper diffamatum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to black as they mature, with the dried berries being the source of the spice black pepper. Its botanical structure supports its climbing habit, with adventitious roots forming along its stems. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
