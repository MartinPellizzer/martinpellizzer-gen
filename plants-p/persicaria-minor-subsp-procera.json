    "intro": "Persicaria minor subsp. procera, commonly known as tall knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Small, white to pale pink flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges."
