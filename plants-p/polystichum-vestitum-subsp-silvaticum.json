    "intro": "Polystichum vestitum subsp. silvaticum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
