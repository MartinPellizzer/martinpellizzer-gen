    "intro": "Poa raduliformis, commonly known as the radula grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance through its deep root system. Botanically, it is notable for its unique leaf morphology and ecological resilience in harsh conditions."
