    "intro": "Physorhynchus, commonly known as the bladder nut or bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, inflated pods that resemble bladders, which help in seed dispersal. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are usually pinnately compound, and the flowers are small and often clustered in racemes. Physorhynchus species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, making them valuable in soil enrichment."
