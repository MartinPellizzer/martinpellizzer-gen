    "intro": "Phoebe elongata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf phoebe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and 1\u20132 inches wide, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
