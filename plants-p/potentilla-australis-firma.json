    "intro": "Potentilla australis firma, commonly known as the Australian silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. Its compact form and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
