    "intro": "Pitcairnia violacea, commonly known as the violet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration. The plant produces vibrant violet or purple flowers that bloom in a spike-like structure, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Pitcairnia violacea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
