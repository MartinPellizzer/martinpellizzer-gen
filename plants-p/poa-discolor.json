    "intro": "Poa discolor, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Poa discolor is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
