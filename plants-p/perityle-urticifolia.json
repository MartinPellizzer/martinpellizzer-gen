    "intro": "Perityle urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous species belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Perityle urticifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
