    "intro": "Paraboea barnettiae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are usually thick and succulent. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
