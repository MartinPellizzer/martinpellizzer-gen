    "intro": "Pinguicula potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosi butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in humid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on slender stalks. Pinguicula potosiensis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
