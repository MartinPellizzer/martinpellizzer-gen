    "intro": "Pleioblastus distichus f. tsuboi, commonly known as the Tsuboi bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to Japan. It features narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy, white to light brown seeds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
