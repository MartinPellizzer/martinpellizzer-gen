    "intro": "Psoralea krebsii, commonly known as the narrowleaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and narrow, pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
