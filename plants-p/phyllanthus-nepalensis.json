    "intro": "Phyllanthus nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters. Phyllanthus nepalensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
