    "intro": "Psilurus rottboellioides, commonly known as the Rottboell's psilurus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of other psilurus species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
