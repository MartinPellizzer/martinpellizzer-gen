    "intro": "Pharmacum confertiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered pharmacum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Pharmacum confertiflorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
