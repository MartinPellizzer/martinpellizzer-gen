    "intro": "Pityrogramma humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's water fern, is a small, perennial fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
