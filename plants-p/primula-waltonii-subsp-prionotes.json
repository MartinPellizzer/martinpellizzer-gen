    "intro": "Primula waltonii subsp. prionotes, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps protect it from cold and UV radiation. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
