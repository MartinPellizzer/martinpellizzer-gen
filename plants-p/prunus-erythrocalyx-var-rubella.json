    "intro": "Prunus erythrocalyx var. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate and have a glossy dark green surface, turning yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
