    "intro": "Papaver paczoskii, commonly known as the Paczoskii poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking red to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
