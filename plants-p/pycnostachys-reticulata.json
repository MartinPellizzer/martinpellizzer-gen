    "intro": "Pycnostachys reticulata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
