    "intro": "Pilea minima, commonly known as the baby tears plant, is a small, compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight silver sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and minimal care needs. Pilea minima is often grown as a decorative plant for its lush, trailing foliage."
