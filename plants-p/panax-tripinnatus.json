    "intro": "Panax tripinnatus, commonly known as the three-lobed ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and yellowish-orange roots. The plant is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three leaflets and a fleshy, aromatic root system. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered in the wild."
