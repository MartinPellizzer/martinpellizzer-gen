    "intro": "Platycaulos cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade flatstem, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Cascade Range. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
