    "intro": "Polypodium verapax, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in P. verapax."
