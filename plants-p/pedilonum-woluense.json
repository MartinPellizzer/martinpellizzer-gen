    "intro": "Pedilonum woluense, commonly known as the Woluense Pedilonum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Pedilonaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
