    "intro": "Phacelia strictiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia strictiflora is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects."
