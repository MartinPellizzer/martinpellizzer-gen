It is native to specific regions with particular soil and climate conditions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, horizontal pattern. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, greenish blooms that are not particularly showy. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting various insect species."
