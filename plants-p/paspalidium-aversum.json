    "intro": "Paspalidium aversum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in pastures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
