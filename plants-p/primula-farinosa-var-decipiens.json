    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique floral morphology, it is sometimes referred to as a \"deceptive\" species, as its flowers may mimic the appearance of other plants to attract pollinators."
