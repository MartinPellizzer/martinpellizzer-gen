    "intro": "Pedicularis kashmiriana subsp. ornata, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in alpine meadows and is often found at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters."
