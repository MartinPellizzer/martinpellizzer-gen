It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth texture and a distinct, sometimes fragrant scent. Platylepis dioica is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
