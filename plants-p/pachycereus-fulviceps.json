    "intro": "Pachycereus fulviceps, commonly known as the fulvous barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically followed by small, red fruits. Its spines are relatively short and white, providing protection from herbivores. This cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
