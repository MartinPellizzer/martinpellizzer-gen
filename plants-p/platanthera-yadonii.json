    "intro": "Platanthera yadonii, commonly known as Yadon\u2019s lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a long, slender stem that produces a dense spike of small, hooded flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
