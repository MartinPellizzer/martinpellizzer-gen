    "intro": "Peperomia heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and bushy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia heptaphylla is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
