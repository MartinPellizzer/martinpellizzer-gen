    "intro": "Psittacanthus cuneifolius subsp. viscoides, commonly known as the viscous psittacanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value to its appearance. This subspecies is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
