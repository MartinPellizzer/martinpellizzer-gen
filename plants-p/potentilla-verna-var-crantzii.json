    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. crantzii, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats."
