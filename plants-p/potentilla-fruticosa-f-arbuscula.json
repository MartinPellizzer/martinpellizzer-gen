    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa f. arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, cold environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
