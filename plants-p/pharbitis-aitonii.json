    "intro": "Pharbitis aitonii, commonly known as morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and pink. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soil. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule that opens when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. The plant has been used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
