    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed false bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizome and pinnately compound fronds with lanceolate, serrated leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it is often found in temperate to subtropical regions. The morphology of Pseudocystopteris longipes reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a common sight in understory habitats."
