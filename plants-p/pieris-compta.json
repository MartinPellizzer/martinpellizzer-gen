    "intro": "Pieris compta, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are followed by bright red or orange berries that persist into the winter. Pieris compta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
