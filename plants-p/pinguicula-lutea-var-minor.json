    "intro": "Pinguicula lutea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that form a rosette and possess specialized structures called tentacles to trap prey. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. This variety is closely related to other species in the Pinguicula genus, sharing similar trapping mechanisms and ecological preferences."
