    "intro": "Planea, commonly known as the plane tree, is a deciduous tree belonging to the family Platanaceae. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. Planea is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. Its fast growth rate and ability to provide shade make it a popular choice for landscaping and street planting."
