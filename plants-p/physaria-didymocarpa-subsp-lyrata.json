    "intro": "Physaria didymocarpa subsp. lyrata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The species is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
