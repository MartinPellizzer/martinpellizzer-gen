    "intro": "Pteris paulistana, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Paulo fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris paulistana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
