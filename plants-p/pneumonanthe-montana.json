    "intro": "Pneumonanthe montana, commonly known as the Montana lungwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
