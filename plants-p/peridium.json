    "intro": "Peridium, commonly known as the outer covering of a spore. It is a protective layer that encases the spore in many fungi and algae. The peridium can vary in thickness and composition depending on the species. It often contains pigments that help in spore dispersal and survival. This structure plays a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of the organism."
