    "intro": "Palaquium rufolanigerum, commonly known as the red-leaf palaquium, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that often display a reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
