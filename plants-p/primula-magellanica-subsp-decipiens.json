It is characterized by its rosette of broad, hairy, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.
