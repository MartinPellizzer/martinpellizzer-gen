It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist, shaded woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens. This variant is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flower clusters compared to other forms of Polemonium racemosum."
