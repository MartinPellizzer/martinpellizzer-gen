    "intro": "Persea croizatii, commonly known as the Croizat\u2019s avocado, is a species of evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to avocados but are typically smaller and have a distinct flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for experimental agriculture."
