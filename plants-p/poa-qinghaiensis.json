    "intro": "Poa qinghaiensis, commonly known as Qinghai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai Lake region in China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in high-altitude, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Poa qinghaiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
