The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in homes and greenhouses."
