    "intro": "Phreatia monticola var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf phreatia, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy sepals and petals, often arranged in a spiral along the flower stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
