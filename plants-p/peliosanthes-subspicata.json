    "intro": "Peliosanthes subspicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a small region in China. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, characterized by its coniferous appearance and toxic compounds such as taxanes. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays and produces small, reddish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
