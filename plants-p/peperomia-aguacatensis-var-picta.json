    "intro": "Peperomia aguacatensis var. picta, commonly known as the Variegated Peppergrass, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Central America. It features glossy, ovate leaves with distinctive white and green variegation, adding visual interest to any indoor space. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, though they are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
