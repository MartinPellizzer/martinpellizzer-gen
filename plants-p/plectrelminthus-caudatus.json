    "intro": "Plectrelminthus caudatus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the western United States."
