    "intro": "Parodia minuta, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, rounded body and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a short, thick stem with a dense covering of spines, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
