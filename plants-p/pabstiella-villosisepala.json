It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring prominently hairy sepals that distinguish it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane habitats. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
