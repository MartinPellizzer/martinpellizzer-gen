    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant is toxic in its raw form."
