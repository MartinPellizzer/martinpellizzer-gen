    "intro": "Phacelia magellanica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Magellan phacelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
