It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a stem that branches into multiple whorls of small, scale-like leaves, which are tightly clustered around the stem. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are usually located at the tips of the branches. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
