It features a pale green to white body with a smooth, spiny exterior, and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant. It is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
