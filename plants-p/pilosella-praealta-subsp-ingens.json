    "intro": "Pilosella praealta subsp. ingens, commonly known as the giant alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces yellow flowers with showy, pappus-based bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally hairy and narrow, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
