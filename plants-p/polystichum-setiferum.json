    "intro": "Polystichum setiferum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores in late summer. The hairy shield fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
