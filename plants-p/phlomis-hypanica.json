    "intro": "Phlomis hypanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Phlomis hypanica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
