    "intro": "Plectritis collina, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a grayish or whitish coating that helps reduce water loss. Plectritis collina produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
