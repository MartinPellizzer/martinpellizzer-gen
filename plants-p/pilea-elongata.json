    "intro": "Pilea elongata, commonly known as the African Violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It features rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea elongata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
