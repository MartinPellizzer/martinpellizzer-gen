    "intro": "Piper subprostratum, commonly known as the prostrate pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thin, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Piper subprostratum is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
