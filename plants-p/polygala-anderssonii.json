    "intro": "Polygala anderssonii, commonly known as the Andersson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small and often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
