It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy and have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
