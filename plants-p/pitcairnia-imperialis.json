    "intro": "Pitcairnia imperialis, commonly known as the imperial pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and arranged in a rosette, forming a central tank to collect rainwater. Pitcairnia imperialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
