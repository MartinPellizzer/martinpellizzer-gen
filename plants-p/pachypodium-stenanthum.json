    "intro": "Pachypodium stenanthum, commonly known as the Madagascar moon cactus, is a succulent native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant typically has a short, stout trunk with sparse, spiny foliage. It produces small, white flowers during the dry season, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
