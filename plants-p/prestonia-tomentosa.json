    "intro": "Prestonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a climbing shrub that produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature."
