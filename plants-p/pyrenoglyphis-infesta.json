    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis infesta, commonly known as the tropical orchid vine, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and long, slender stems that support its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow blossoms that bloom throughout the warm season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention in humid environments. Pyrenoglyphis infesta is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
