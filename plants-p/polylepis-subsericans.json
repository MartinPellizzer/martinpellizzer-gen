    "intro": "Polylepis subsericans, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a tree species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, small, rounded leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. It plays a vital ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various endemic species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
