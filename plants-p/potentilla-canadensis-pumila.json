    "intro": "Potentilla canadensis pumila, commonly known as the Canadian creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
