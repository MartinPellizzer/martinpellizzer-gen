It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
