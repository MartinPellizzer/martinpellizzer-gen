    "intro": "Physaria aurea, commonly known as the golden burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and striking color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Physaria aurea is also known for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures."
