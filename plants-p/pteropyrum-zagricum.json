    "intro": "Pteropyrum zagricum, commonly known as the Zagreb pteropyrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
