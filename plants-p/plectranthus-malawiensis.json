It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
