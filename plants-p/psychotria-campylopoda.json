It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It often grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of rainforests. Psychotria campylopoda is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and pharmacological significance."
