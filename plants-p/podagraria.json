It belongs to the family Lamiaceae and is characterized by its square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Podagraria is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its creeping growth habit."
