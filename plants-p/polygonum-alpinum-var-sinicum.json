It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated margin, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountainous climates and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
