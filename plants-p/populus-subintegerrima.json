    "intro": "Populus subintegerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
