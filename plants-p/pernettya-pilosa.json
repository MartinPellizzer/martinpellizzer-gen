    "intro": "Pernettya pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, dark blue or black berries that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain heat in its cold environment. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Pernettya pilosa plays a role in local wildlife diets and is valued for its ornamental appearance in cold-climate gardens."
