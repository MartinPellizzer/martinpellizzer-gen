    "intro": "Pyrenaria rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated pyrenaria, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many plants in the Rubiaceae family. Pyrenaria rostrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
