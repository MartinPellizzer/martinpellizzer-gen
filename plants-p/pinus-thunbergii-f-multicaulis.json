    "intro": "Pinus thunbergii f. multicaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed Japanese black pine, is a unique variant of the Japanese black pine characterized by its multiple trunks. This form exhibits a more compact and bushy growth habit compared to the typical single-trunk variety. It is native to Japan and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces cone-shaped seed clusters that mature in the second year, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture and bonsai cultivation."
