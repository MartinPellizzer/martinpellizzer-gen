    "intro": "Phegopteris rudis, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in height. The fronds are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, which are covered in a distinctive rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
