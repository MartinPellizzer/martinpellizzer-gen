It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are popular in local cuisines.

This variety is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
