    "intro": "Pleurothallis pilostoma, commonly known as the hairy-stalked pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of hairy structures on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
