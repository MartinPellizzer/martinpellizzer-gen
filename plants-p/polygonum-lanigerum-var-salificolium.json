    "intro": "Polygonum lanigerum var. salificolium, commonly known as the salt marsh knotweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has erect, somewhat hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-salinity soils and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
