    "intro": "Panicum abyssinicum, commonly known as Abyssinian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in shades of brown or purple, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This grass is often used for forage and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
