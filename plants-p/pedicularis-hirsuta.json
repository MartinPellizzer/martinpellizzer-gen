    "intro": "Pedicularis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy monkey orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Oronoideae and is characterized by its erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
