    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides var. lonchitoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a variant of the eastern wood fern. It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polystichum acrostichoides."
