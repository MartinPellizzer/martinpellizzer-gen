    "intro": "Polypodium turquinum, commonly known as the Turquin's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Polypodium turquinum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
