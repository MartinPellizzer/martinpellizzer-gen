    "intro": "Pyrus fulvida, commonly known as the yellow crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature, though they are not typically eaten by humans. Pyrus fulvida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
