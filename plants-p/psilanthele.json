It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or translucent flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves, and its flowers are often mistaken for insects due to their unique shape and coloration. Psilanthele thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Due to its rarity and elusive nature, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
