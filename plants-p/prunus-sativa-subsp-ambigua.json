    "intro": "Prunus sativa subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely known Prunus sativa subsp. domestica."
