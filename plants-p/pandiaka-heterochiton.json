It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a combination of smooth and serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
