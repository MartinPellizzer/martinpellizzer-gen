    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. elongata, commonly known as the Persian plane tree, is a variant of the oriental plane tree native to regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are often larger and more elongated compared to the typical oriental plane. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in urban environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. The bark is thick and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance."
