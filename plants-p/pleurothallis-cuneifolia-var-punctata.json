    "intro": "Pleurothallis cuneifolia var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted leaf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
