    "intro": "Pseudogynoxys alajuelana, commonly known as the Alajuela pseudogynoxys, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
