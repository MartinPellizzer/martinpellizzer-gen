    "intro": "Pavetta tomentella, commonly known as the wooly pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Pavetta tomentella is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
