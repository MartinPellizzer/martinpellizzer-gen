    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, three-parted flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and pine forests. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
