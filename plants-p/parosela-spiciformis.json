It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and erect. Parosela spiciformis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
