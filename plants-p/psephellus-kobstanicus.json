    "intro": "Psephellus kobstanicus, commonly known as the Kobstan's rockcress, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pale yellow to white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
