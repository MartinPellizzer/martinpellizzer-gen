    "intro": "Prunus mume var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-flowered Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sour-tasting fruits that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to other Prunus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn vibrant red in the fall, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
