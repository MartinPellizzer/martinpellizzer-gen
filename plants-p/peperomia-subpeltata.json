    "intro": "Peperomia subpeltata, commonly known as the Shiny Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia subpeltata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
