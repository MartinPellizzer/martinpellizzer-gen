It features glossy, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish or maroon underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity.
