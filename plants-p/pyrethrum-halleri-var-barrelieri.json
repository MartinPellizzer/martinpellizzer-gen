    "intro": "Pyrethrum halleri var. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces natural pyrethrins, which are potent insecticides, making it valuable in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
