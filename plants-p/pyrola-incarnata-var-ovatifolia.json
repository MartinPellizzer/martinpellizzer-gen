It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, acidic forest soils and thrives in moist, well-drained environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, while its flowers are pink and bloom in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more ovate leaves compared to the typical form of Pyrola incarnata."
