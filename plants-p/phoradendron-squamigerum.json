    "intro": "Phoradendron squamigerum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are scale-like, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. Despite its parasitic nature, it contributes to biodiversity and forest dynamics."
