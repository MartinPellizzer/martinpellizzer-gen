    "intro": "Prunus acinaria, commonly known as the snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red or black as it matures. Prunus acinaria is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
