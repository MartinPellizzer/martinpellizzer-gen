    "intro": "Pteris decomposita, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or decaying matter. The fronds are usually light green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
