It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red center, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tips. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Pancratium variegatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
