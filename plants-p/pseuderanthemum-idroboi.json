    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, bright-colored blooms, often in shades of red or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Pseuderanthemum idroboi is well-suited for warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
