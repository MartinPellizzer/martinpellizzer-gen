    "intro": "Peperomia trifolia f. suborbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
