    "intro": "Prestinaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Prestinaria is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
