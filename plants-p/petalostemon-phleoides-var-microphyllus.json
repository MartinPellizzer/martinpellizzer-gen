The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats."
