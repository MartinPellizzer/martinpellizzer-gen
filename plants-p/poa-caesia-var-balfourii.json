    "intro": "Poa caesia var. balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variant is often found in meadows and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
