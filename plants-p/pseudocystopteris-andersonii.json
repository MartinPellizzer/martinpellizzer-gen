    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's false scaly water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true water ferns, though it is not closely related. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
