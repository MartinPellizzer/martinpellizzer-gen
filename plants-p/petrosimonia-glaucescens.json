It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and appear in clusters during the summer months. Petrosimonia glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
