    "intro": "Pedicularis tenuituba, commonly known as the narrow-tubed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Pedicularis tenuituba thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
