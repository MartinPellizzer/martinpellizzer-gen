    "intro": "Phaseolus modestus, commonly known as the small bean or wild bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in warm, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a cover crop or for its edible seeds."
