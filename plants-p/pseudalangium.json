    "intro": "Pseudalangium, commonly known as the false angel's trumpet, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plants are native to regions in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Pseudalangium species are typically shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often aromatic bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the plant's ecological role."
