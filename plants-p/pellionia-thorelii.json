    "intro": "Pellionia thorelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Pellionia thorelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
