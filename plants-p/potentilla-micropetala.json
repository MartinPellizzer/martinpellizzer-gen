    "intro": "Potentilla micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, five-lobed leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Potentilla micropetala is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
