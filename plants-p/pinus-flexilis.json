    "intro": "Pinus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The flexible pine plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
