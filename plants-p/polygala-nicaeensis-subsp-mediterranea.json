    "intro": "Polygala nicaeensis subsp. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with a distinctive, fleshy appendage. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas, scrublands, and limestone outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
