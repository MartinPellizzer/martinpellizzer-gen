    "intro": "Paratropia corona-sylvae, commonly known as the crown-of-the-forest, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protected environments to thrive."
