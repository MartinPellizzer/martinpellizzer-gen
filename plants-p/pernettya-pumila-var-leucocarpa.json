    "intro": "Pernettya pumila var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's fruits are small, round, and white or pale yellow, distinguishing it from other cowberry varieties. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest habitats. The species is notable for its cold hardiness and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
