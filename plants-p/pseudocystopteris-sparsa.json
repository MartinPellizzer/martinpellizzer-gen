    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris sparsa, commonly known as the sparse shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
