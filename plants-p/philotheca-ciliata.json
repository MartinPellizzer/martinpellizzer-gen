    "intro": "[WRONG START] Philoteca ciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost pipe, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Philotheca ciliata is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with high salinity."
