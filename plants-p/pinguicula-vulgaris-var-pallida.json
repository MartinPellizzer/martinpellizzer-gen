    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. pallida, commonly known as the pale butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, with five petals and a spurred shape. The leaves are not only used for capturing prey but also serve as storage organs for water and nutrients."
