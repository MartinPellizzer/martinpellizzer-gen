    "intro": "Polygala macerrima, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Polygala macerrima plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for various pollinators."
