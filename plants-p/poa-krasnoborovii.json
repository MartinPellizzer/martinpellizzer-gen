    "intro": "Poa krasnoborovii, commonly known as the red-brown meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that often display a reddish-brown hue, especially in the basal regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
