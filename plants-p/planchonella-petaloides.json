    "intro": "Planchonella petaloides, commonly known as the \"petal-like\" or \"flower-like\" hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus genus. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
