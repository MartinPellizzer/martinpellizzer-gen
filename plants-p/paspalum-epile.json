    "intro": "Paspalum epile, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Paspalum epile is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
