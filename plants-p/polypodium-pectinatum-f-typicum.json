    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum f. typicum, commonly known as the typical polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green to bronze in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction."
