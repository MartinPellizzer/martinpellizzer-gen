    "intro": "Pteris kiuschiuensis var. kiuschiuensis, commonly known as the Kiuschiu fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are characterized by their finely divided segments and a pale green coloration."
