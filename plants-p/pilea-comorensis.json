    "intro": "Pilea comorensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Comoros Islands. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea comorensis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
