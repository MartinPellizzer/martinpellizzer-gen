    "intro": "Polypodium stanleyanum, commonly known as the Stanley's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium stanleyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
