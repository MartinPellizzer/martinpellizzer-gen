    "intro": "Pterostylis planulata, commonly known as the small-lobed duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces two to four lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rainforest or understorey habitats. The orchid is pollinated by small flies, which are attracted to its scent and flower structure."
