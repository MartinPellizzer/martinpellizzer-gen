    "intro": "Pedicularis pseudostenocorys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects."
