    "intro": "Petasites hybridus subsp. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow meadow saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and broader, more rounded leaves compared to other Petasites species."
