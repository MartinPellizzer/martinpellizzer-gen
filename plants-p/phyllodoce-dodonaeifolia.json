    "intro": "Phyllodoce dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold climates. Phyllodoce dodonaeifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various arctic insects and small animals."
