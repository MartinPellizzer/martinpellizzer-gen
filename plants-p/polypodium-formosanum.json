    "intro": "Polypodium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its native habitat."
