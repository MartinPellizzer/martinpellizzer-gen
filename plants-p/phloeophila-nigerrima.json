    "intro": "Phloeophila nigerrima, commonly known as the black phloeophila, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark that gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its unique morphological features, including its thick, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phloeophila nigerrima is considered a vulnerable species."
