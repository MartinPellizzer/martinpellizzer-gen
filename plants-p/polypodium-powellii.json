    "intro": "Polypodium powellii, commonly known as Powell's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its identification."
