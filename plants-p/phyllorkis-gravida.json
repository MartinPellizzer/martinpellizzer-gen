    "intro": "Phyllorkis gravida, commonly known as the heavyleaf phyllorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its roots are known to contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal use. Due to habitat loss, Phyllorkis gravida is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
