    "intro": "Prunus glabra var. occultipes, commonly known as the smooth almond or wild almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, oval leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed enclosed in a hard pit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
