    "intro": "Panicum pauperulum, commonly known as the poor man's panicgrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairless stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
