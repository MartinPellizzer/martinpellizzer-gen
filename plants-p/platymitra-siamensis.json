    "intro": "Platymitra siamensis, commonly known as the Siam flat-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
