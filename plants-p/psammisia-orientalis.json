    "intro": "Psammisia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Psammisia orientalis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
