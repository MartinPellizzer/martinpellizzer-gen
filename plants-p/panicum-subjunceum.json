    "intro": "Panicum subjunceum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters characteristic of the grass family. Panicum subjunceum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
