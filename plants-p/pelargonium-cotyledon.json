    "intro": "Pelargonium cotyledon, commonly known as the Jade Plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often glossy and oval in shape. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, or red during the spring and summer months. Its slow growth rate and ease of propagation through stem cuttings make it a popular houseplant."
