It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for various insects and birds. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new hosts, aiding in its propagation."
