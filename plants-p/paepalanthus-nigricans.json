    "intro": "Paepalanthus nigricans, commonly known as the black nightshade or black cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its spiny, leafless stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark purple berries. Its leaves are usually absent, and it has a unique ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Paepalanthus nigricans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
