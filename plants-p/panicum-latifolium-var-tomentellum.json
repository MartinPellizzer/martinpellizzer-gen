    "intro": "Panicum latifolium var. tomentellum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or other fibrous materials. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
