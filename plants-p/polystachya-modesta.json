    "intro": "Polystachya modesta, commonly known as the modest bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are usually small and clustered, are often borne on a spike above the leaf rosette. Polystachya modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
