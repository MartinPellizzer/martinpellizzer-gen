    "intro": "Polygonum marioticum, commonly known as water knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and rivers. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
