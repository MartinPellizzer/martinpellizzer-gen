    "intro": "Phegopteris cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are typically divided into small, oblong segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Phegopteris cunninghamii plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
