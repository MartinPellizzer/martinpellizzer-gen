    "intro": "Polystichum mehrae f. latifundus, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a rough texture, with spore-producing structures located on the underside. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
