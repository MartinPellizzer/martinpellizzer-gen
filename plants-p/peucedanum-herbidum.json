    "intro": "Peucedanum herbidum, commonly known as the European cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbrella-shaped flower clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a smooth, hollow stem that is often reddish in color. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been historically used in herbal medicine."
