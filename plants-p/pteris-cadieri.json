    "intro": "Pteris cadieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris cadieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
