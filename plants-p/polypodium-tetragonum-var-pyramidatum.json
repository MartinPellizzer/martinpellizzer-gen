It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit, forming dense, compact fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
