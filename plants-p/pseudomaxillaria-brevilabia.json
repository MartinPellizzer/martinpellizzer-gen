It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, featuring a slender, spurred lip. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
