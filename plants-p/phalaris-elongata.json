    "intro": "Phalaris elongata, commonly known as tall false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish or yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Phalaris elongata is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
