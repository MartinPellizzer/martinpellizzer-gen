    "intro": "Pleopeltis deparioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a dark green, leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
