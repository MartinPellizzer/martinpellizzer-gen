    "intro": "Potentilla declinata, commonly known as the bent-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive downward curvature, and it produces woody stems that become more branched with age. Potentilla declinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
