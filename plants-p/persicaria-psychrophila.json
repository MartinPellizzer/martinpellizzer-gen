    "intro": "Persicaria psychrophila, commonly known as the Arctic knotweed, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streams and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered pink or white flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-light conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
