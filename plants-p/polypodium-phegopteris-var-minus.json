    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other polypodium species. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
