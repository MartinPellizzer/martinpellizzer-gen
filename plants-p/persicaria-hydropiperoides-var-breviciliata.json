    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiperoides var. breviciliata, commonly known as narrow-leaved water pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairless or sparsely hairy. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats."
