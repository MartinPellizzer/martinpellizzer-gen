    "intro": "Pleurothallis humidicola, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
