    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. vegetum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive sheathing base. Small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
