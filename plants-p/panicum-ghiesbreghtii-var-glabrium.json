    "intro": "Panicum ghiesbreghtii var. glabrium, commonly known as the smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its varietal name \"glabrium.\" The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
