    "intro": "Psychotria conica subsp. conica, commonly known as the hooded psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles. The plant is characterized by its distinctive hood-like calyx that encloses the flower, giving it its common name. It typically grows as an erect shrub with simple, opposite leaves. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually white or pale green, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species."
