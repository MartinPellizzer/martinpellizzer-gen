    "intro": "Pinus remota subsp. catarinae, commonly known as the Catarina pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a medium to tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this subspecies are small and woody, containing two to three seeds each. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
