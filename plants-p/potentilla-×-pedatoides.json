    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 pedatoides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically oval to ovate, with a slightly hairy surface and toothed margins. Potentilla \u00d7 pedatoides is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
