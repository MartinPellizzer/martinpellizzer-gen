    "intro": "Poinciana pulchra, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat."
