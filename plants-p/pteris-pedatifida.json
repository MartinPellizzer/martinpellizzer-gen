    "intro": "Pteris pedatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris pedatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
