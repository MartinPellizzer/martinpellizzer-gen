    "intro": "Pandanus gemmifer, commonly known as the hairy pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making ropes and mats in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas."
