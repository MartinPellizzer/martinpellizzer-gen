    "intro": "Poa lanuginosa var. elata, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a variant of the hairy grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
