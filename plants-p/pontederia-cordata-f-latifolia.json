    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its broader, more pronounced leaves. It is an aquatic plant native to the Americas and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic settings. This cultivar is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
