    "intro": "Polystichum nigrum, commonly known as black holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of East Asia. It features dark, leathery, glossy fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Polystichum nigrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
