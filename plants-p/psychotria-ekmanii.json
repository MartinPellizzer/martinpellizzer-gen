    "intro": "Psychotria ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat, Psychotria ekmanii is considered a rare and endemic species."
