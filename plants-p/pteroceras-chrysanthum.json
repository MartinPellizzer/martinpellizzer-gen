It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faintly sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific care requirements."
