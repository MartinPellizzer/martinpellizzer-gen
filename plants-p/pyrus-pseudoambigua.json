It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar to pears but are typically smaller and have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The plant is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
