    "intro": "Puya ugentiana, commonly known as the Andean grass of fire, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and large, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments, with its leaves often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically green or red, and they bloom in a short, intense season. Puya ugentiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
