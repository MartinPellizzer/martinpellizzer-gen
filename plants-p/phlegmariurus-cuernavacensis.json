    "intro": "Phlegmariurus cuernavacensis, commonly known as the Cuernavaca liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its simple, flattened thallus that grows close to the ground. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of leaf-like structures called phyllids, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Phlegmariurus cuernavacensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
