    "intro": "Physalis aggregata, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or golden berry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of orange-yellow fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which dries to a reddish color as the fruit ripens. The fruit is small, about 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, and has a sweet, tangy flavor. It is often used in culinary applications and has medicinal properties due to its high vitamin C content."
