    "intro": "Penstemon pulchellus, commonly known as the showy penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces showy, spire-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon pulchellus is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
