    "intro": "Psoralea palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the legume family. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Psoralea palaestina is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
