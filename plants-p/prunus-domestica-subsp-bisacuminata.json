    "intro": "Prunus domestica subsp. bisacuminata, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers in early spring, which give way to dark blue or black berries by late summer. These berries are edible but contain small seeds and are often used in jams and wines. The plant has a hardy, drought-resistant nature and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
