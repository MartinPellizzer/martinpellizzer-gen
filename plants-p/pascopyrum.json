    "intro": "Pascopyrum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seeds enclosed in a\u9896 (lemma and palea). Pascopyrum species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. These plants are of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to their potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments."
