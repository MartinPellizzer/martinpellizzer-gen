It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
