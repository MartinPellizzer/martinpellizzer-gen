    "intro": "Paspalum quadrifarium var. elongatum, commonly known as the tall sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant is often found in sandy or well-drained soils, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its adaptability and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
