    "intro": "Podostemum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy podostemum, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged, with roots that anchor it to rocks. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, producing small, yellow flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring clear, oxygen-rich water and stable substrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for aquatic ecosystem health."
