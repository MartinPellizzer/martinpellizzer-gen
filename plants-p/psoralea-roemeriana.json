    "intro": "Psoralea roemeriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its seeds are encased in small, hard pods, a common feature among legumes. Psoralea roemeriana is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
