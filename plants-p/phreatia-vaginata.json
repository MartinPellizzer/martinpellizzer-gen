    "intro": "Phreatia vaginata, commonly known as the banana orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Phreatia vaginata is often found growing on trees or rocks in moist, tropical environments."
