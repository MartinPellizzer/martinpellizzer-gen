    "intro": "Plantago subulata subsp. atlantis, commonly known as the Antarctic plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climatic conditions."
