It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the stems form a dense, bushy structure with multiple branches. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain several seeds, similar to other pea varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant morphology and genetics."
