    "intro": "Pneumatopteris laevis, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris laevis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
