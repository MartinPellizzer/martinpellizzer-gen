    "intro": "Pleurothallis variabilis, commonly known as the variable pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
