    "intro": "Polypogon nilgiricus, commonly known as the Nilgiri sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
