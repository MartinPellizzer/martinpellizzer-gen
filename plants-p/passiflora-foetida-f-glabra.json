    "intro": "Passiflora foetida f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth passionflower, is a variant of the passionvine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Passiflora foetida. The plant produces striking flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit is a rough, spiny capsule that contains multiple seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
