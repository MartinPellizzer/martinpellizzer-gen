    "intro": "Pinus nivea, commonly known as the white pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and its distinctive white to bluish-gray bark. The tree produces long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a unique appearance. Its cones are woody and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pinus nivea is well adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in mountainous regions."
