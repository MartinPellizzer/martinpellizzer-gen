    "intro": "Pedicularis praeclara, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
