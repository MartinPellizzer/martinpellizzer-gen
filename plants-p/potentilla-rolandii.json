    "intro": "Potentilla rolandii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Potentilla rolandii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in challenging climates."
