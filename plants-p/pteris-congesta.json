    "intro": "Pteris congesta, commonly known as the dense water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist soil or aquatic environments. Its fronds are typically dark green, with a glossy surface and a feathery appearance. Pteris congesta thrives in humid conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
