    "intro": "Poa briziformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-ranked spikelets. Poa briziformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
