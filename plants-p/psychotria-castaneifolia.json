    "intro": "Psychotria castaneifolia, commonly known as the \"chocolate vine,\" is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that resemble those of the chestnut tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Psychotria castaneifolia is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in its leaves."
