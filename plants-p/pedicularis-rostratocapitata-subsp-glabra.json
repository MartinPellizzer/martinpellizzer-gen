    "intro": "Pedicularis rostratocapitata subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-horned lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The subspecies glabra is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which lack the hairy texture found in other subspecies. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows, where it blooms in late summer."
