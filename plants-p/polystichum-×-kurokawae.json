    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 kurokawae, commonly known as the Kurokawa holly fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum hondoense and Polystichum acutatum. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and have a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
