    "intro": "Peramium longirostratum, commonly known as the long-beaked peramium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique elongated floral structure, which resembles a beak. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peramium longirostratum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
