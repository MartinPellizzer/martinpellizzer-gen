    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's hairy woodfern, is a variant of the hairy woodfern native to eastern North America. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often hairy fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can anchor itself in rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
