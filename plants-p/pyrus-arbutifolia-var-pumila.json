    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish fruits known as pomes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique leaf coloration and seasonal interest throughout the year."
