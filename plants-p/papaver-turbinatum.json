    "intro": "Papaver turbinatum, commonly known as the turban poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features striking, turban-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. The seeds are enclosed in a thick, papery capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
