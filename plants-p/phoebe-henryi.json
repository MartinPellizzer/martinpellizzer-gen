    "intro": "Phoebe henryi, commonly known as Henry's phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for native plant landscaping."
