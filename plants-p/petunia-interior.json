    "intro": "Petunia interior, commonly known as the rock petunia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. Petunia interior is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
