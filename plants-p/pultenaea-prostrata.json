It features small, pea-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from autumn to spring. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pultenaea prostrata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
