    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus superbus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a striking addition to desert landscapes."
