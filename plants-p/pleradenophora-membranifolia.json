    "intro": "Pleradenophora membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, translucent foliage. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, hair-like pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Its leaves are often described as membranous due to their thin, paper-like texture. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
