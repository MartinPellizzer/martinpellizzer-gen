    "intro": "Puccinellia conferta, commonly known as sea barley, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant typically grows in low vegetation, forming dense mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia conferta plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
