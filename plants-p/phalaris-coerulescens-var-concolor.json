    "intro": "Phalaris coerulescens var. concolor, commonly known as bluegrass or coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and aesthetic appeal."
