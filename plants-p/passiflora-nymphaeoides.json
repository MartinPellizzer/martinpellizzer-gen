It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
