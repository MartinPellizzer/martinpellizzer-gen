    "intro": "Pellaea tenera, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
