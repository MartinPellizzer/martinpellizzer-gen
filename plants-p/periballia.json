It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Periballia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
