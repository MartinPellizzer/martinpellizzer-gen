    "intro": "Pseudocinchona, commonly known as the false quinine tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like or small tree structure, with simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Pseudocinchona species are of interest for their potential medicinal properties, though they are not as widely used as true cinchona trees."
