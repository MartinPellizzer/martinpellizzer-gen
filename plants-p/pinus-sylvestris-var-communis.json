    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. communis, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender needles arranged in pairs, and its distinctive cone-shaped fruits. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, open crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. The Scots pine is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas, heathlands, and mountainous regions."
