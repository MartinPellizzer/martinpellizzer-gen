    "intro": "Panicum parvispiculum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and features dense, compact clusters of tiny spikelets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
