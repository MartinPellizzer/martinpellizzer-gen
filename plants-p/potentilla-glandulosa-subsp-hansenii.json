    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa subsp. hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hirsute (hairy) stems and leaves, which are often glandular, contributing to its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
