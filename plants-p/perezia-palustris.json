    "intro": "Perezia palustris, commonly known as the marsh perezia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its habitat. Perezia palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
