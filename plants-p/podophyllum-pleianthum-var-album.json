    "intro": "Podophyllum pleianthum var. album, commonly known as the white Christmas fern, is a variant of the Christmas fern characterized by its pale, almost white or silvery foliage. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded woodland environments. Its fronds are lance-shaped with a distinctive, glossy appearance and are typically evergreen throughout the year. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils under partial to full shade."
