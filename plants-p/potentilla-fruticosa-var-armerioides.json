    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. armerioides, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine and arctic regions of North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in groups of five. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
