    "intro": "Polystichum birii, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often recurved fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in compact, shield-like structures. Polystichum birii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
