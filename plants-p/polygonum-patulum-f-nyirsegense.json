    "intro": "Polygonum patulum f. nyirsegense, commonly known as the Hungarian knotweed, is a variant of the species Polygonum patulum, characterized by its distinctive, winding stems that form a dense mat. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe, particularly Hungary, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its unique growth habit and its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
