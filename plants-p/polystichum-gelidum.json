    "intro": "Polystichum gelidum, commonly known as the cold fern or Arctic fern, is a hardy plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum gelidum is well adapted to low temperatures and can survive in harsh, alpine conditions."
