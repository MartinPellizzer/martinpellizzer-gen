    "intro": "Polygala caudata, commonly known as the featherleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Polygala caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
