It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to wetland conditions."
