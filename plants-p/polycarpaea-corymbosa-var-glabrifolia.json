    "intro": "Polycarpaea corymbosa var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in corymbs, giving it its species name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variant is distinguished by its smooth foliage and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
