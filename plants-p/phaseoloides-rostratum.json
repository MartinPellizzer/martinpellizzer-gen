It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive rostrum-like appendage on the terminal leaflet. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of legumes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by insects."
