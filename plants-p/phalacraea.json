    "intro": "Phalacraea, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Phalacraea species typically have palmate leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. They are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
