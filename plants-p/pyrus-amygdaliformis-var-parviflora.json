    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf apricot pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with smooth, grayish-brown bark and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length. The flowers are small, white to pink, and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is a small, round, yellowish pear with a sweet and aromatic flavor, often used in local cuisines. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
