    "intro": "Prunus rusticana, commonly known as the wild cherry or European bird cherry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern and central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn yellow to orange in late summer. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus rusticana is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
