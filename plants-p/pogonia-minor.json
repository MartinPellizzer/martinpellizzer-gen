    "intro": "Pogonia minor, commonly known as the small pink pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns of purple and green, which help in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
