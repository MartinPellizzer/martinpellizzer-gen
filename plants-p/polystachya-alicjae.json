    "intro": "Polystachya alicjae, commonly known as the Alice's spikegrass, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and intricate floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives on rocky substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, displaying a variety of colors including white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystachya alicjae is considered a conservation concern."
