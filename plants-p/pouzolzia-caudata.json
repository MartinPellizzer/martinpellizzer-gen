    "intro": "Pouzolzia caudata, commonly known as the trailing pouzolzia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged, papery fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pouzolzia caudata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
