    "intro": "Pandanus copelandii, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a crown-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiny, triangular fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network in the soil, contributing to soil stability. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its durable leaves."
