    "intro": "Papaver argemone var. glabrum, commonly known as the Mexican poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright orange to red petals and a distinctive, thick, rounded seed capsule. The plant is an annual herb with smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in dry, disturbed areas. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiky shell and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
