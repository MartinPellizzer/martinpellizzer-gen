    "intro": "Pleodendron, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's roots are anchored in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies, while its stems and leaves remain above the water surface. Pleodendron produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in freshwater ecosystems."
