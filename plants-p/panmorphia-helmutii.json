    "intro": "Panmorphia helmutii, commonly known as the spiralleaf orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking spiral-shaped leaves, which are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Panmorphia helmutii is considered a vulnerable species."
