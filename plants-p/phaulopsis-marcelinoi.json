    "intro": "Phaulopsis marcelinoi, commonly known as the Marcelino's phaulopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
