    "intro": "Potentilla salmoniana, commonly known as the salmon pink cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a low, spreading growth habit. Potentilla salmoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
