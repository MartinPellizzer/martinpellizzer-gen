    "intro": "Parrya karatavica, commonly known as the Karatava parrya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora and ecological adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
