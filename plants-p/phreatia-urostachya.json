    "intro": "Phreatia urostachya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is crucial for its survival in humid tropical environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phreatia urostachya is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
