    "intro": "Polygonum bourdinii, commonly known as the Indian or Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and can form dense colonies, often invading disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose spikes, and typically appear in shades of red, pink, or white. Polygonum bourdinii is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be considered invasive in some regions."
