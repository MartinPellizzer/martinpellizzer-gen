    "intro": "Pleurenodon, commonly known as the pleurenodontid, is a genus of extinct mammals that lived during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. These animals were small, rodent-like creatures with a distinctive dental structure adapted for a diet of seeds and plants. They possessed continuously growing incisors, a feature common among many herbivorous mammals. Pleurenodon fossils have been found in various regions of Europe and North America, indicating a wide geographic distribution. Their botanical significance lies in their role as early representatives of the group that would later evolve into modern rodents."
