    "intro": "Pitcairnia cyanopetala, commonly known as the blue-flowered pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and retain moisture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
