    "intro": "Polypodium tenuipes, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
