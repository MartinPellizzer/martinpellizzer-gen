    "intro": "Pseudoryza, commonly known as the false rice, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and often grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Pseudoryza species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are sometimes mistaken for true rice due to their similar appearance but are not related to the rice genus Oryza."
