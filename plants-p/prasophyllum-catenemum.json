The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grassy woodlands. Prasophyllum catenemum is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its delicate appearance and specific ecological requirements. It is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
