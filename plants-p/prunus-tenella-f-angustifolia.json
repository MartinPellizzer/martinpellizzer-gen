    "intro": "Prunus tenella f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, dark red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and seasonal interest. Due to its limited size, it is well-suited for small gardens or container growing."
