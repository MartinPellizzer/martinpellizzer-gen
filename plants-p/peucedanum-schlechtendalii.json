    "intro": "Peucedanum schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, bluish-green leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and white, forming dense, umbrella-like clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and herbal gardens."
