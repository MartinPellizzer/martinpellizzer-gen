    "intro": "Pronephrium womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley's bladder, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are adaptations that aid in gas exchange and buoyancy, allowing the plant to thrive in freshwater environments. The plant belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia. Its morphology includes long, flexible stems with numerous small, bladder-like organs that float on the water surface. Pronephrium womersleyi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
