    "intro": "Plantaginorchis suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant, and often white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact growth habit with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
