    "intro": "Polystichum erythrosorum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum erythrosorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
