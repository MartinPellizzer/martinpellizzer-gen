The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, giving it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
