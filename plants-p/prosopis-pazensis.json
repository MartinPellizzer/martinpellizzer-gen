    "intro": "Prosopis pazensis, commonly known as the Paraguay thorn tree, is a species of leguminous tree native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and Argentina. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods that contain edible seeds. It has deep roots that help in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion. Prosopis pazensis is also valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
