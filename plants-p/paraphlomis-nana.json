    "intro": "Paraphlomis nana, commonly known as the dwarf parsnip, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
