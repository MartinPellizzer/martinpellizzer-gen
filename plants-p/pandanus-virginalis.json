    "intro": "Pandanus virginalis, commonly known as the white pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, which are often used in traditional crafts and decorations. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. Its fibrous leaves are also used for thatching and weaving in many island communities."
