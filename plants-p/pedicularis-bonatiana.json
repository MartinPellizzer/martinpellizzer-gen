    "intro": "Pedicularis bonatiana, commonly known as the Bonati's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
