    "intro": "Psoralidium lanceolatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
