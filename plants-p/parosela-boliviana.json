    "intro": "Parosela boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
