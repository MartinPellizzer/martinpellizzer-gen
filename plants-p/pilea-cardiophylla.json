    "intro": "Pilea cardiophylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, round, shield-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Due to its slow growth and ease of care, it is often used for indoor decoration and propagation through stem cuttings."
