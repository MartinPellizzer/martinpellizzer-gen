    "intro": "Panax weinmanniae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species. The plant is characterized by its woody rhizome and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
