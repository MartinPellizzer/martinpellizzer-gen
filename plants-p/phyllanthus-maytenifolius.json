    "intro": "Phyllanthus maytenifolius, commonly known as the African star apple or wild pear, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, yellow or orange berries that are edible but often have a bland taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
