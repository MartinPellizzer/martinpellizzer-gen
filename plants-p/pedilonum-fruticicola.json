    "intro": "Pedilonum fruticicola, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
