    "intro": "Polygala compressa f. mandrarensis, commonly known as the Mandrarensis milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions in southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its morphology includes narrow leaves and pale yellow or greenish-white flowers, which are often arranged in spicate inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
