    "intro": "Polypodium medullare, commonly known as the heartleaf polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive feature in its habitat."
