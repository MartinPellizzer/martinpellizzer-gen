    "intro": "Polygala cornuta subsp. fishiae, commonly known as the Fish's horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale in color, and it produces small, round pods that contain the seeds. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
