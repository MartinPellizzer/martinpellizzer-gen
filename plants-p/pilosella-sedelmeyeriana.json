    "intro": "Pilosella sedelmeyeriana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pilosella sedelmeyeriana is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
