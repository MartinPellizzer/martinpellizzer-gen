    "intro": "Peixotoa adenopoda, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Peixotoa adenopoda is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the manufacture of musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
