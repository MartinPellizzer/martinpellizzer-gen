    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum amgense, commonly known as the Amgense rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and intricate frond structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
