    "intro": "Persicaria sagittifolia, commonly known as arrowleaf jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its association with the genus Persicaria, which includes other species with similar morphological characteristics."
