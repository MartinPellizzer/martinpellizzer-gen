    "intro": "Procris urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white petals that are adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Procris urdanetensis is considered a vulnerable species."
