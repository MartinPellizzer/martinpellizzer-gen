It produces distinctive inflated calyces that enclose its small, bright red berries, which are edible when ripe. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
