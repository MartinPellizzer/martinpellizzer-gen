    "intro": "Pyrostria anjouanensis, commonly known as the Anjouan palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Comoros Islands, specifically the island of Anjouan. This palm is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Pyrostria anjouanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
