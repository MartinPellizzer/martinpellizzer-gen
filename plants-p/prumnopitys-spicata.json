    "intro": "Prumnopitys spicata, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the branches, giving the tree a distinctive silver appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
