It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in smooth, dark green to purple-brown bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
