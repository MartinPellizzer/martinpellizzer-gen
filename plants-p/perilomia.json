    "intro": "Perilomia, commonly known as the \"bluebell\" or \"white bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and violet. Perilomia species are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense clumps with strap-like leaves. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
