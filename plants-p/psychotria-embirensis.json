    "intro": "Psychotria embirensis, commonly known as the Brazilian Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and deforestation."
