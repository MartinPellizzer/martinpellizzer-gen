    "intro": "Psychotria grayana, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"grayana,\" is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
