    "intro": "Pycnandra chartacea, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of white, fibrous tissue beneath. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The tree is valued for its durable, lightweight wood and is often used in construction and as a source of fiber."
