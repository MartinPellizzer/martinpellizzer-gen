    "intro": "Peperomia tithymaloides, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and often velvety leaves that come in shades of green, silver, and purple. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tithymaloides is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
