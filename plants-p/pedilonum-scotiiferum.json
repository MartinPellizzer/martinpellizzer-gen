    "intro": "Pedilonum scotiiferum, commonly known as the Scottish slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a small shoe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in peat bogs or among heather. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually a mix of white and green, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
