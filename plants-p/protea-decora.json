    "intro": "Protea decora, commonly known as the decorative protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of a central cone-like structure surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant produces small, white flowers within the cone, which are often overlooked due to the prominent bracts. Protea decora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes."
