    "intro": "Phoradendron fonsecanum, commonly known as the Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that coil around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to South America and is often found growing on trees in tropical forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential agricultural pest."
