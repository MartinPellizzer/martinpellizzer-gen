    "intro": "Provenzalia palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in damp, marshy areas and is characterized by its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates. Provenzalia palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
