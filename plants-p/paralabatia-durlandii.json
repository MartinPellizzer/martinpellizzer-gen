    "intro": "Paralabatia durlandii, commonly known as the Durland's paralabatia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
