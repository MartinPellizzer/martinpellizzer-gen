    "intro": "Paracaryopsis malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar burr, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that encase the seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
