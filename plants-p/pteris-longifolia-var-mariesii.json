    "intro": "Pteris longifolia var. mariesii, commonly known as the Mariesii water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a feathery appearance, and they emerge from the rhizomes in a compact, upright manner. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
