It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, broadly ovate leaves with slightly wavy margins. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic foliage."
