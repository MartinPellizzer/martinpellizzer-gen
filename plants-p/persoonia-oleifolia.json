    "intro": "Persoonia oleifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost tube or ghost gum, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. These flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Persoonia oleifolia is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
