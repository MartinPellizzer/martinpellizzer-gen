    "intro": "Picea abies var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping Norway spruce, is a low-growing variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its prostrate or\u530d\u5310 growth habit, forming dense mats or cushions on the ground. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly twisted. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
