    "intro": "Ponthieva rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique rostrum, a slender projection on the lip of its flower, which gives it its common name. Ponthieva rostrata typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
