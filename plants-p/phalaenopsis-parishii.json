    "intro": "Phalaenopsis parishii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Phalaenopsis parishii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
