It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a vibrant mix of red, yellow, and blue hues. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits that are similar in appearance to those of other passionfruit species. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often twined around supporting structures. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation in suitable climates."
