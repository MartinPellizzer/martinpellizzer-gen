    "intro": "Pennisetum glabrum var. filiforme, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, fountain-like growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, feathery plumes that add ornamental value, especially in late summer and autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a low-maintenance plant suitable for various climates."
