    "intro": "Pyrus keissleri, commonly known as the Keissler pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and sweet. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
