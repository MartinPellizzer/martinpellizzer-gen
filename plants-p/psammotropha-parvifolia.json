It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psammotropha parvifolia is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing loose soil."
