    "intro": "Polypodium triseriale, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
