It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Pneumatopteris eburnea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
