It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
