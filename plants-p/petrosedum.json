    "intro": "Petrosedum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and compact growth habit. They are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, often thriving in rocky or arid environments. Petrosedum species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Many varieties are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
