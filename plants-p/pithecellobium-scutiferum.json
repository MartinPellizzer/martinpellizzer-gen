    "intro": "Pithecellobium scutiferum, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
