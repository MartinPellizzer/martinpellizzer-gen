    "intro": "Pelea orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular pelea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular or nearly round leaves, which are typically thick and waxy to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pelea orbicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
