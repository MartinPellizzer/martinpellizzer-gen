    "intro": "Pinus arizonica var. stormiae, commonly known as the Arizona white pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, purple-cone-shaped seed cones that mature over several years. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
