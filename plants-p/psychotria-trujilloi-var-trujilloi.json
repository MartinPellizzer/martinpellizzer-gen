It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
