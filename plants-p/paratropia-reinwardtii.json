It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and have a unique, lantern-like appearance. Paratropia reinwardtii is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions."
