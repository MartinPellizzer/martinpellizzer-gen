    "intro": "Potentilla polyodonta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Potentilla polyodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
