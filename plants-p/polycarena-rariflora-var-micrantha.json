    "intro": "Polycarena rariflora var. micrantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved polycarena, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
