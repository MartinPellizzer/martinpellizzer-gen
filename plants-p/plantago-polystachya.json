    "intro": "Plantago polystachya, commonly known as the tall plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces long, branched inflorescences bearing small, greenish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
