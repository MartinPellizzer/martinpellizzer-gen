    "intro": "Pseudammi, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, often clustered flowers. They are typically shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Pseudammi species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction."
