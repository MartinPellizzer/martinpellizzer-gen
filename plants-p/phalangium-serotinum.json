    "intro": "Phalangium serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering spider lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features strap-like leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with a greenish throat, and it produces small, black berries that contain the seeds. Phalangium serotinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
