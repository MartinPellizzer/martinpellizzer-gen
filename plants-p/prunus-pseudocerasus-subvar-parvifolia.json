    "intro": "Prunus pseudocerasus subvar. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese date or small-leaved Chinese date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, and juicy fruits that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in traditional Chinese medicine. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
