    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter cherry, is a unique floral variant of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, producing pink flowers in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant is a compact shrub with a dense, rounded form, making it suitable for small gardens or container planting. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The botanical features include small, ovate leaves and a relatively short lifespan, typically lasting a few years before the plant declines."
