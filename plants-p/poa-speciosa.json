    "intro": "Poa speciosa, commonly known as the showy bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, two-lipped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
