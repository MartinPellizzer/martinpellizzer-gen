It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to habitat loss, Pisonia gammillii is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
