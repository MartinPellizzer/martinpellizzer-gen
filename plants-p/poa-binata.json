    "intro": "Poa binata, commonly known as the twinflower bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa binata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
