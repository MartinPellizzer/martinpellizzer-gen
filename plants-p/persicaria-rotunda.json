It features alternate, ovate to round leaves that are often hairy and have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are erect and can grow up to 2 meters tall, often branching near the top. Persicaria rotunda is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils."
