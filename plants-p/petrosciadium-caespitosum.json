    "intro": "Petrosciadium caespitosum, commonly known as the desert mustang grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and high temperatures. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in restoration projects in desert ecosystems."
