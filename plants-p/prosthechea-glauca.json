    "intro": "Prosthechea glauca, commonly known as the green-leaved orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Prosthechea glauca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
