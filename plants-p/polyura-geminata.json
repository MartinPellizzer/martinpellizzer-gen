    "intro": "Polyura geminata, commonly known as the twin-spotted swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in parts of Southeast Asia. Its larvae feed on plants in the Rutaceae family, particularly citrus species. The adult butterfly has striking black wings with yellow and white markings. The plant's role as a host for the larvae is crucial to the butterfly's life cycle. Botanically, it is associated with aromatic plants that contain compounds beneficial to the insect's development."
