    "intro": "Paronychia argentea subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its silvery foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
