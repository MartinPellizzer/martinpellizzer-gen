It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.
