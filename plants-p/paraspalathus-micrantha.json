    "intro": "Paraspalathus micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Paraspalathus micrantha is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
