It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its roots are reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Polygonum idaeum is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
