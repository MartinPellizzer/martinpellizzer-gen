    "intro": "Populus salicifolia, commonly known as the silky poplar or Canadian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in reforestation efforts. The leaves are typically 5\u201310 centimeters in length and turn yellow in the fall."
