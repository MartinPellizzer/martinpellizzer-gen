    "intro": "Paspalum inaequiglume, commonly known as the unequal-glume paspalum, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that are unequal in length, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Paspalum inaequiglume is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
