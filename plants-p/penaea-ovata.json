    "intro": "Penaea ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in temperate regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in shallow water habitats. Penaea ovata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
