    "intro": "Phyllobotryon bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted leafcup, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a basal rosette of leaves that form a cup-like structure. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a single umbel, which is typical of the carrot family. Its habitat is limited to specific microclimates, often in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specialized ecological requirements, Phyllobotryon bracteatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
