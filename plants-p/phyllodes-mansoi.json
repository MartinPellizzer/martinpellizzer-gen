    "intro": "Phyllodes mansoi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves due to their complex structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of many wattles. Its phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures, are adapted for reducing water loss in arid environments. Phyllodes mansoi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
