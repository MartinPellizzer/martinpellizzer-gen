    "intro": "Peperomia ayacuchoana, commonly known as the Ayacucho peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia ayacuchoana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
