    "intro": "Pternopetalum viride, commonly known as the green-winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Pternopetalum viride is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
