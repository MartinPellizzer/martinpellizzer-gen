    "intro": "Puya hutchisonii, commonly known as the Chilean torch, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its dry environment. Its flowers, which can be red, orange, or yellow, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Puya hutchisonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates."
