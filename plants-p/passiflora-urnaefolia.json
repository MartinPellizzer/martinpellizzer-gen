    "intro": "Passiflora urnaefolia, commonly known as the urn-leaved passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy, glossy surface and often have a slight urn-like indentation at the base. This plant produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and are used in traditional medicine. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
