    "intro": "Psychotria marantifolia, commonly known as the red-eyed wonder, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich structure. Psychotria marantifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
