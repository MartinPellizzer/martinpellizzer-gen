It features fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense ground cover. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Philadelphus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
