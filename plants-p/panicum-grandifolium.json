    "intro": "Panicum grandifolium, commonly known as large-leaf bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-gray florets that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. Its fibrous root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. Panicum grandifolium is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
