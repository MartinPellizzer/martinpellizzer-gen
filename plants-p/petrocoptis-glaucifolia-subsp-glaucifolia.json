    "intro": "Petrocoptis glaucifolia subsp. glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. This subspecies thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in alpine botany and ecological research."
