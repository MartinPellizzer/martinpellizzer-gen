    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. litoralis, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, linear leaves. This variety is typically found in dune environments and along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces small, bristly seed capsules. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
