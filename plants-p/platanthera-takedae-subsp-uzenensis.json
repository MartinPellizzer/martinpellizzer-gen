    "intro": "Platanthera takedae subsp. uzenensis, commonly known as the Uzen marsh twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as marshes and mountainous wetlands. It has narrow, linear leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
