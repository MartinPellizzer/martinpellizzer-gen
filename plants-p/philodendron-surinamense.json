    "intro": "Philodendron surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, spade-shaped leaves that are often lighter in color than the primary foliage. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
