    "intro": "Phaseolus saponaceus, commonly known as the soap bean or saponaria bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive pods containing round, black seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. Its name derives from the saponin compounds found in its seeds, which produce a soap-like foam when crushed. Phaseolus saponaceus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both medicinal and decorative purposes."
