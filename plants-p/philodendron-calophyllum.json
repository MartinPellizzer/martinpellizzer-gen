    "intro": "Philodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the Calophyllum philodendron, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation in warm climates."
