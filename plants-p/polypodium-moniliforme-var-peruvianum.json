    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its unique appearance."
