    "intro": "Pogonia magnifica, commonly known as the showy pogonia, is a striking orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid pink and white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often near streams or in swampy areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its habitat. The showy pogonia is also notable for its intricate floral structure, which includes a distinctive spur that houses nectar."
