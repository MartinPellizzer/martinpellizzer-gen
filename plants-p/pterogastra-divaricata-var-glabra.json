    "intro": "Pterogastra divaricata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed pterogastra, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically exhibits a compact growth habit with broad, smooth, and often glabrous leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its lack of pubescence, setting it apart from other varieties within the species."
