    "intro": "Polypodium lachniferum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its smooth, glabrous fronds. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its fronds are usually lanceolate in shape and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. This variant is notable for its reduced pubescence, distinguishing it from other forms of Polypodium lachniferum."
