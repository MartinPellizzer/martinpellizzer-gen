    "intro": "Pinus zamoraensis, commonly known as the Zamora pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its cones are woody and release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
