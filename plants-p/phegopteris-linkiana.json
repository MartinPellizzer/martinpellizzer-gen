    "intro": "Phegopteris linkiana, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of a water lily, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
