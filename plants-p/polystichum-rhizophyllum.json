    "intro": "Polystichum rhizophyllum, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, woody rhizomes and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum rhizophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
