    "intro": "Phlebodium lanceolatum var. crassinervatum, commonly known as the broad-veined wall fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, broad veins. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in rocky crevices, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are evergreen, providing a dense, ornamental appearance that makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
