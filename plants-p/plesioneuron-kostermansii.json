    "intro": "Plesioneuron kostermansii, commonly known as the Kostermans' pteridium, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
