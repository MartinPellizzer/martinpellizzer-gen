    "intro": "Pultenaea wudjariensis, commonly known as the Wudjari bush pea, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Pultenaea wudjariensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
