    "intro": "Putranjiva roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian whale tree, is a unique tropical plant native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stem and spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries that contain a single seed. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is adapted to coastal environments, often found in mangrove forests. Putranjiva roxburghii is notable for its ability to thrive in saline soils and its role in local ecosystems."
