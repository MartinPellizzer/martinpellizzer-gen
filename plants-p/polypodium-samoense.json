    "intro": "Polypodium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan wall fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa and nearby regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Polypodium samoense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
