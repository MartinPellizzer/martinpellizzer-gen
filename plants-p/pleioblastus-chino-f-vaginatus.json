It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods. It is well-suited for ornamental use in gardens due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. This bamboo is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
