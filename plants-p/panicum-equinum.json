    "intro": "Panicum equinum, commonly known as horse grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed bracts. Panicum equinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
