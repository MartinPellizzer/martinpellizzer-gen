    "intro": "Phanera excelsa var. excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is notable for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
