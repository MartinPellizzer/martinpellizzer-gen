    "intro": "Poa annua var. eriolepis, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species. It is characterized by its fine, tufted grass blades that are often covered with a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The variety eriolepis is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to other forms of Poa annua."
