    "intro": "Pyrostria pendula, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. Pyrostria pendula is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
