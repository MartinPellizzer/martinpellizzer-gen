    "intro": "Parietaria repens, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Parietaria repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along walls, in gardens, and in woodland areas. It is also known for its allergenic properties, as it can cause skin irritation and respiratory issues in some individuals."
