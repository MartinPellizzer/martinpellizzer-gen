    "intro": "Pitcairnia anarosae, commonly known as the Anaros\u00e1 Pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically stiff and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid but often misty habitat. Pitcairnia anarosae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
