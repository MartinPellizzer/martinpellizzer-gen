    "intro": "Penstemon ternatus subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
