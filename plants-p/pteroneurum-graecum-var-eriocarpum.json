    "intro": "Pteroneurum graecum var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the Greek pteroneurum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its small, hairy, and glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animal activity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
