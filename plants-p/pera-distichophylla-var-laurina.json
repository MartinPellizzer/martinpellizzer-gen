    "intro": "Pera distichophylla var. laurina, commonly known as the laurel pera, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
