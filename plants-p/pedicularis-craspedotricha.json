    "intro": "Pedicularis craspedotricha, commonly known as the hairy-lip monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its striking appearance and specialized morphology make it a notable species within its native habitat."
