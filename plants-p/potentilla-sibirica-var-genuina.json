    "intro": "Potentilla sibirica var. genuina, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
