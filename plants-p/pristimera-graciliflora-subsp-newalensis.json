    "intro": "Pristimera graciliflora subsp. newalensis, commonly known as the Newalensis spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
