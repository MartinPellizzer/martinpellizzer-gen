    "intro": "Phaseolus longepedunculatus f. typicus, commonly known as the long peduncled bean, is a botanical variant of the genus Phaseolus. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks that support the inflorescences. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets arranged symmetrically. This species is native to Central and South America and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, though it is less commonly grown than other bean varieties."
