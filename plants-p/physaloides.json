    "intro": "Physaloides, commonly known as the \"bottle-gourd\" or \"calabash,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. These plants are characterized by their large, inflated fruits that resemble bottles or gourds, often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, while the vines grow vigorously, climbing or trailing along the ground. Physaloides species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They require warm climates and well-drained soil to thrive, making them popular in both ornamental and agricultural settings."
