    "intro": "Pseudobarleria polytricha, commonly known as the hairy false balsam, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Pseudobarleria polytricha is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
