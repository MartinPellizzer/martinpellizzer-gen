    "intro": "Polypodium aureum f. mazei, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
