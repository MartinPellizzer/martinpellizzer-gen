    "intro": "Physianthus auricomus, commonly known as the golden crown plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, golden-orange bracts that resemble a crown, hence its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Physianthus auricomus thrives in bright, indirect light and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value."
