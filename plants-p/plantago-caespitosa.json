    "intro": "Plantago caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's barley or tufted plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are broad and ribbed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is widely used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
