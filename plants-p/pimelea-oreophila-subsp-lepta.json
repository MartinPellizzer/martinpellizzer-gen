    "intro": "Pimelea oreophila subsp. lepta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact shrub form and small, white or cream-colored flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in southern Australia, including regions like New South Wales and Victoria. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
