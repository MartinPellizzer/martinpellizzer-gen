    "intro": "Primula tyrolensis f. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine primrose, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, moist conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine displays."
