It features broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it ideal for use in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
