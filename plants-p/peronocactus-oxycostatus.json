    "intro": "Peronocactus oxycostatus, commonly known as the sharp-edged cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick stems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is a notable species in desert ecosystems."
