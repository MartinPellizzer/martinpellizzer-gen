    "intro": "Pleurolobus salicifolius var. densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower willow-leaf pleurolobus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and lance-shaped leaves that are green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along streams. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a humid, temperate climate."
