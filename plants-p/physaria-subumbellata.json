    "intro": "Physaria subumbellata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with a low, spreading growth habit, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Physaria subumbellata is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient member of desert flora."
