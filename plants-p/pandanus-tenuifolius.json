    "intro": "Pandanus tenuifolius, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spirally arranged, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its roots are fibrous and can be used to make rope and mats, while its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
