    "intro": "Phravenia, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Phravenia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The wood of certain Phravenia species is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
