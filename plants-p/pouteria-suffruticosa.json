    "intro": "Pouteria suffruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by large, woody pods containing edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat and is also economically significant for its nut production."
