It features dense, hairy foliage that helps protect it from cold temperatures and desiccation. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments."
