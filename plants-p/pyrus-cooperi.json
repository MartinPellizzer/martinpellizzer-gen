    "intro": "Pyrus cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes. Its fruit, resembling a pear, is often used in jams and preserves. Pyrus cooperi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
