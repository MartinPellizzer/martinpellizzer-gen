    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant exhibits morphological variability, with differences in leaf width, tillering, and flowering structures depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences and is wind-pollinated. Due to its adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings."
