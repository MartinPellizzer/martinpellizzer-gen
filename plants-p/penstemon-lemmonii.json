    "intro": "Penstemon lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon lemmonii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
