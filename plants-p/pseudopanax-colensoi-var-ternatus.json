    "intro": "Pseudopanax colensoi var. ternatus, commonly known as the Colenso's tree fern, is a unique species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its leaves are dimorphic, with juvenile leaves being spiral and adult leaves being pinnate. This variety is particularly rare and is often found in sheltered, moist habitats within the forests of the South Island."
