    "intro": "Potentilla uniflora subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, often silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators. Its compact growth form and resilience make it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in rocky or sandy gardens."
