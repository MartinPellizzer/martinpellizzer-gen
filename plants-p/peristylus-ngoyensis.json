    "intro": "Peristylus ngoyensis, commonly known as the Ngoyi's peristylus, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries as fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peristylus ngoyensis is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
