    "intro": "Phegopteris granulosa, commonly known as the granular water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are often divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its spores are released from sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Phegopteris granulosa make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
