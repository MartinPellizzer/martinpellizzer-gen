    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 subhirtella var. pleniflora, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is prized for its abundant, showy double blooms that appear in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The flowers consist of multiple layers of petal-like structures, giving them a full, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, tart cherries that are edible but not typically cultivated for consumption. It is widely grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
