    "intro": "Peucedanum vaginale, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowparsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a hollow, leaf-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a mild, parsley-like scent."
