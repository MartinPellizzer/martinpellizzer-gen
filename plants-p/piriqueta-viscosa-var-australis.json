It is characterized by its succulent, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically erect and can grow up to several feet in height, with a woody base. The species is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
