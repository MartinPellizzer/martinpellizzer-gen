    "intro": "Paliurus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined acanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern and its showy, spiky yellow flowers that appear in summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Paliurus reticulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
