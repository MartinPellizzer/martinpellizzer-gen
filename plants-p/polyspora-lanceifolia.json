    "intro": "Polyspora lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polyspora lanceifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
