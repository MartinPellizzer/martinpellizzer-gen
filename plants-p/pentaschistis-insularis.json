    "intro": "Pentaschistis insularis, commonly known as the island pentaschistis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pentaschistis insularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
