    "intro": "Prunus padus f. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common bird cherry. It is characterized by its striking marbled patterns on the leaves and bark, which give it a unique visual appeal. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3\u20136 meters. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries in late summer. This cultivar is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic value and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental features."
