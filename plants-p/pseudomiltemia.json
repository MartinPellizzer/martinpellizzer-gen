    "intro": "Pseudomiltemia, commonly known as the false miltemia, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences, which resemble those of other members of the carrot family. They typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The leaves are usually finely divided and have a distinctive, often pungent, scent. Pseudomiltemia species are valued for their ornamental qualities and have been used in traditional herbal medicine in some cultures."
