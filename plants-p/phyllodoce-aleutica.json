    "intro": "Phyllodoce aleutica, commonly known as the Alaska mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic habitats. Phyllodoce aleutica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
