    "intro": "Physocarpus glabratus, commonly known as smooth bush honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
