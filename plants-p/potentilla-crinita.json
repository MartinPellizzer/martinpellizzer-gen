    "intro": "Potentilla crinita, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Potentilla crinita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
