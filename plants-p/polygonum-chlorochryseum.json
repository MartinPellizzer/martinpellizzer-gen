    "intro": "Polygonum chlorochryseum, commonly known as golden-leaf knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which gives them their distinctive color and texture. Polygonum chlorochryseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
