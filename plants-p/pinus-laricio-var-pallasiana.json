    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, evergreen foliage that forms a conical shape. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they retain their color year-round. The cones of this plant are large and woody, containing edible seeds that have been traditionally used by humans. This species is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
