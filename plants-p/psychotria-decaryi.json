    "intro": "Psychotria decaryi, commonly known as the \"devil's weed,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue or black berries that contain the seeds. Psychotria decaryi is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as ibogaine."
