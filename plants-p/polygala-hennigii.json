It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
