    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. fauriei, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. The plant has hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It typically grows in rocky or meadow environments at high altitudes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh climates and poor soils."
