    "intro": "Panicularia rigida, commonly known as rigid panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its panicle-like inflorescence, which consists of multiple branches bearing small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Panicularia rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
