    "intro": "Poa laxa var. zollikoferi, commonly known as the Zollikofer's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
