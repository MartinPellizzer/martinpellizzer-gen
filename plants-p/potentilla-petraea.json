    "intro": "Potentilla petraea, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Potentilla petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in challenging garden settings."
