    "intro": "Poa planicularis, commonly known as the flatleaf meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a tufted growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the end of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa planicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in grassland ecosystems."
