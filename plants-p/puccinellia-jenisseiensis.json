    "intro": "Puccinellia jenisseiensis, commonly known as the Jenisei rush, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
