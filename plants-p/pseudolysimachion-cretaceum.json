    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits specific botanical characteristics. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks. Its thallus is leathery and crust-like, with a distinct coloration that varies depending on environmental conditions. The plant plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as an indicator of air quality."
