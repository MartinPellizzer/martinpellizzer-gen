    "intro": "Photinia glomerata var. microphylla, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that provide a dense, lush appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal flowering and fruiting."
