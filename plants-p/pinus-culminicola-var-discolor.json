    "intro": "Pinus culminicola var. discolor, commonly known as the white-barked mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale bark, which contrasts with its dark green needles. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before releasing seeds. This species is adapted to harsh, cold climates and plays a vital role in stabilizing mountain ecosystems."
