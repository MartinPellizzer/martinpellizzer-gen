    "intro": "Polygala leptocaulis var. glochidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, cylindrical stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. The plant has small, spiny bracts that give it a distinctive appearance and help in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert regions."
