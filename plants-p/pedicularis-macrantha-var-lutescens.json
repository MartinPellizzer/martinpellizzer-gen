    "intro": "Pedicularis macrantha var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its unique floral structure and vivid color make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
