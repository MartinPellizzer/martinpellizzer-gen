    "intro": "Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia var. maprouneifolia, commonly known as the Maprouneifolia or the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture."
