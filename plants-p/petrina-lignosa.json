    "intro": "Petrina lignosa, commonly known as the hard-wood petrina, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Petrina lignosa is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
