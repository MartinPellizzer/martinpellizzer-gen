    "intro": "Philammos arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf firetree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens along the South African coast."
