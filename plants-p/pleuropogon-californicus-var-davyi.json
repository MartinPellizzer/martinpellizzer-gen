It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in arid environments. It is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
