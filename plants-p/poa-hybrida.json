    "intro": "Poa hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa hybrida has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
