    "intro": "Peperomia palmana var. pseudo-oxystachya, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to South America. It features dense, velvety foliage with deep green to almost black hues, giving it a rich, textured appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and often have a waxy coating that enhances its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green or red, though these are not the primary attraction of the plant. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
