    "intro": "Pleurothallis dolichocaulon, commonly known as the long-stemmed pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, often branched stem and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
