    "intro": "Pleopeltis leucophora, commonly known as the white-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a pale green hue and prominent white veins. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of root-like structures that help anchor it to its substrate. Pleopeltis leucophora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
