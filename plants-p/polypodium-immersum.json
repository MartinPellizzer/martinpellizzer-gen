    "intro": "Polypodium immersum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its submerged fronds that grow in aquatic environments. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. The plant's rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its fronds float on the water surface. Its leaves are usually divided into small, delicate segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Polypodium immersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
