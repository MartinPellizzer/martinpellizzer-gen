It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
