    "intro": "Prangos thapsioides, commonly known as the desert thapsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Prangos thapsioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survival in harsh, semi-arid climates."
