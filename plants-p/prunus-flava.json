It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Prunus flava thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an important species in the Prunus genus, which includes many economically significant fruit trees."
