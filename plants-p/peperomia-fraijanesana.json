    "intro": "Peperomia fraijanesana, commonly known as the Fraijanesana pepper plant, is a species native to Central America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage rather than its flowers or fruits."
