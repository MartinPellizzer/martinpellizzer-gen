    "intro": "Penstemon alpinus, commonly known as the alpine penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Penstemon alpinus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
