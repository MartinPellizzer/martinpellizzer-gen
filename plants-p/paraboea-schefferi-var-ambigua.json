    "intro": "Paraboea schefferi var. ambigua, commonly known as the waxy vine, is a climbing plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often dry habitats. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its stems are flexible and can twine around supports, allowing it to climb and spread in shrubland or forest margins. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
