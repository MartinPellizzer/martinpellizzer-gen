    "intro": "Pleurothallis lansbergiana, commonly known as the Lansberg's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
