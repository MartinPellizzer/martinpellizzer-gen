    "intro": "Pinellia tuberifera, commonly known as the Chinese yam or pinellia, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, while the flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The tubers are often harvested for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
