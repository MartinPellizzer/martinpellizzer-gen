    "intro": "Polypodium diplosorum, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its densely packed, dark green fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or rock. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
