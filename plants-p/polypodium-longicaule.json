    "intro": "Polypodium longicaule, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped spore-producing structure called a sorus, which is typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Polypodium longicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
