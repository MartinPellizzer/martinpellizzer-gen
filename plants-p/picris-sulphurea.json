    "intro": "Picris sulphurea, commonly known as yellow starwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
