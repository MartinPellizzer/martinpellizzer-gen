    "intro": "Pteris tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-toothed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. The plant's spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its propagation in humid climates."
