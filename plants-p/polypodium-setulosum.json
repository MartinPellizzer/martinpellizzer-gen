    "intro": "Polypodium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium setulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
