    "intro": "Proustia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate pustula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its unique, net-like leaf venation is a distinguishing feature, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. Proustia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
