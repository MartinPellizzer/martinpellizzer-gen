    "intro": "Planchonella microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved planchonella, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. The plant has limited commercial use but is valued for its ecological role in native ecosystems."
