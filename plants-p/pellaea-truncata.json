    "intro": "Pellaea truncata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. Pellaea truncata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
