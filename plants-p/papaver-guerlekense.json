    "intro": "Papaver guerlekense, commonly known as the Guerlekense poppy, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with prominent black markings. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elaterium seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
