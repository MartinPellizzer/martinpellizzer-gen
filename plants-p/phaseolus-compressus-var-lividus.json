    "intro": "Phaseolus compressus var. lividus, commonly known as the dark green bean, is a variety of the common bean species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, compact foliage and small, bean-like pods that mature to a yellowish color. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptic and slightly hairy. This variety is often cultivated for its edible pods, which are harvested before they fully mature."
