    "intro": "Petrogeton patens, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to attach to host plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across rocky and sandy soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
