It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure known as a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
