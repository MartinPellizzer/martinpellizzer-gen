    "intro": "Prasophyllum mollissimum, commonly known as the soft-leaved leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its erect, leafy stems that bear a single, showy inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. Prasophyllum mollissimum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
