    "intro": "Pitcairnia ancuashii, commonly known as the Ancuash pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
