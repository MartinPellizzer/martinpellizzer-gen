    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. tenuiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, meadows, and wetlands. The plant features slender, arching stems with small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its showy yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are clustered in groups of five, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
