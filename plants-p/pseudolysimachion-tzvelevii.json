    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelev's pseudolysimachion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
