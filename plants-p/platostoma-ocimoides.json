    "intro": "Platostoma ocimoides, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is an indicator species for areas with high water tables."
