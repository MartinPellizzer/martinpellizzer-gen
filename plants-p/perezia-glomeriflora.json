    "intro": "Perezia glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered perezia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
