    "intro": "Physalis capsicifolia, commonly known as the pepperleaf husk or wild ground-cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green and slightly pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing small, edible fruits. These fruits are similar in appearance to those of other Physalis species but are generally smaller and less commonly cultivated. It is native to South America and is often found in dry, open habitats."
