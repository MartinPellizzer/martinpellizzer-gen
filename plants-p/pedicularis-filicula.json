    "intro": "Pedicularis filicula, commonly known as the fern-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Pedicularis filicula is often found in association with other hemiparasitic plants, as it partially relies on its host for nutrients."
