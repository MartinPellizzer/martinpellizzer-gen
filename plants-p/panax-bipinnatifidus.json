    "intro": "Panax bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnatifid leaves that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
