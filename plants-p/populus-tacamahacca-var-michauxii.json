    "intro": "Populus tacamahacca var. michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's poplar, is a variety of the Tacamahacca poplar native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in many poplar species. It thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
