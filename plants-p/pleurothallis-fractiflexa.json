    "intro": "Pleurothallis fractiflexa, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
