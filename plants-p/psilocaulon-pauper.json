    "intro": "Psilocaulon pauper, commonly known as the poor man's psilocybe, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Psilocybiaceae. It is characterized by its small, sturdy fruiting bodies that typically grow in grassy areas and woodlands. The cap is initially bell-shaped and becomes convex with age, while the stem is slender and often covered in fine, fibrous threads. The spores are produced in a distinctive, sticky layer called the gleba, which is a key feature for identification. This species is notable for its psychoactive properties, containing compounds similar to psilocybin found in other hallucinogenic mushrooms."
