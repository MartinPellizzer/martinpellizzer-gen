    "intro": "Phyllanthus simplex var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
