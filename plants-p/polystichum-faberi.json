It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polystichum faberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
