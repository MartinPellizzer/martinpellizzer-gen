    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf poa, is a variant of the Poa cenisia species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
