    "intro": "Paramongaia mirabile, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that resemble celestial bodies. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Paramongaia mirabile is considered an endangered species."
