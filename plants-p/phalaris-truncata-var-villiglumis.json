    "intro": "Phalaris truncata var. villiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. The species is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) lemma at the base of each floret, which contributes to its scientific name."
