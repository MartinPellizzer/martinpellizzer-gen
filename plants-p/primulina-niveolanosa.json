It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often grown as a decorative plant in greenhouses and conservatories."
