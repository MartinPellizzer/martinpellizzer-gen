    "intro": "Pedicularis interioroides, commonly known as the interioroides lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. The plant produces showy, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
