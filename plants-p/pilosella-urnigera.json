    "intro": "Pilosella urnigera, commonly known as the urn-shaped pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small, daisy-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
