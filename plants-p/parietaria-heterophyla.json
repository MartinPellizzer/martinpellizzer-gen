    "intro": "Parietaria heterophyla, commonly known as the common wall rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Parietaria heterophyla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can cause skin irritation due to its fine hairs."
