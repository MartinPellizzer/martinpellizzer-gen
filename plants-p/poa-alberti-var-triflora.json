    "intro": "Poa alberti var. triflora, commonly known as the Albert's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, tufted clumps of fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
