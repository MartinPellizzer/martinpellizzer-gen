    "intro": "Pastinaca gelendostensis, commonly known as the Gelendost Mountains burdock, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are elongated and lobed, while its flowers are small and clustered in a rounded head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
