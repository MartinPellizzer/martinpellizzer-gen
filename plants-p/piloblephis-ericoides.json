    "intro": "Piloblephis ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Piloblephis ericoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
