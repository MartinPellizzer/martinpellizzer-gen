    "intro": "Persicaria longiseta var. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, setting it apart from other Persicaria species."
