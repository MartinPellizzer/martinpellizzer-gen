It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Phyllanthus brevipes is also noted for its potential medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
