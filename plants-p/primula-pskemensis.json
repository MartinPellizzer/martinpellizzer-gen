    "intro": "Primula pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem Primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pskem River valley in the Russian Caucasus. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
