    "intro": "Plumeria obtusa var. sericifolia, commonly known as the white frangipani, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The leaves are elongated, dark green, and have a leathery texture, while the stems are often covered in a powdery, white coating. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in floral arrangements and as a street tree in tropical regions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established."
