    "intro": "Prosthechea christii, commonly known as the Christ's prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Prosthechea christii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
