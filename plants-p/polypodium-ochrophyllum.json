    "intro": "Polypodium ochrophyllum, commonly known as the golden-stem fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate fronds. Polypodium ochrophyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
