    "intro": "Pouteria venulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. Its fruit develops from the flowers and typically matures over several months. The plant has a long lifespan and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
