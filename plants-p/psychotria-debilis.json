It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. The plant has been historically used for its stimulating effects due to the presence of alkaloids like cocaine."
