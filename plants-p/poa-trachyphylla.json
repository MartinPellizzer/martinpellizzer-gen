    "intro": "Poa trachyphylla, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in erosion control. Poa trachyphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
