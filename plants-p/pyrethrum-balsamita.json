    "intro": "Pyrethrum balsamita, commonly known as bishop's weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots contain volatile oils that have been historically used in herbal medicine. Pyrethrum balsamita is also noted for its role in traditional pest control due to its natural insecticidal properties."
