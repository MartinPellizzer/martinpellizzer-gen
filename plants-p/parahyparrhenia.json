    "intro": "Parahyparrhenia, commonly known as the silverleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, forming dense clumps with a compact growth habit. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces blue to purple flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Parahyparrhenia is drought-tolerant and is often used in erosion control and native plant gardens."
