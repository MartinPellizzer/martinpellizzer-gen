    "intro": "Petalochilus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
