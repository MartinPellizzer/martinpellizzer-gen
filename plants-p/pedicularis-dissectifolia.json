    "intro": "Pedicularis dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissect-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with two lips, and bloom in late summer. Pedicularis dissectifolia is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
