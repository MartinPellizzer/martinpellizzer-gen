    "intro": "Pilosella piloselloides subsp. assimilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, often in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. This subspecies is notable for its fine, silky hairs that cover its foliage and stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
