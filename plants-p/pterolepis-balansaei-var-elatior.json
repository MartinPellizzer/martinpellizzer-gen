    "intro": "Pterolepis balansaei var. elatior, commonly known as the greater pterolepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
