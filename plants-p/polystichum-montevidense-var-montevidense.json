    "intro": "Polystichum montevidense var. montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
