    "intro": "Puccinellia nudiflora, commonly known as sea oats, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dune structures, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration. Puccinellia nudiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
