    "intro": "Primula lichiangensis var. halapa, commonly known as the Yunnan primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against frost. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
