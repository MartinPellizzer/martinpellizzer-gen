    "intro": "Prunus litigiosa var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small-leaved cherry, is a compact shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring small, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red or black berries. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a foundation plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable species for both horticultural and ecological applications."
