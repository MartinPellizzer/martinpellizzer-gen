    "intro": "Paspalum modestum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species."
