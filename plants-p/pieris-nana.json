    "intro": "Pieris nana, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf evergreen azalea, is a compact shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red during the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, rounded growth habits."
