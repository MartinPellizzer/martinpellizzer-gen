    "intro": "Phreatia altigena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and large, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, are highly fragrant and bloom in clusters. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Phreatia altigena is considered a conservation concern."
