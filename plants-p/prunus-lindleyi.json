    "intro": "Prunus lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, bright red drupes that are edible but generally not favored for culinary use. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Prunus lindleyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate flowers and attractive fall foliage."
