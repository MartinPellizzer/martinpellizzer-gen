    "intro": "Porroglossum leslie-garayi, commonly known as the Leslie Garay's porroglossum, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cooler, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with yellow to orange petals, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
