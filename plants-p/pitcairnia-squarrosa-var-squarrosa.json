    "intro": "Pitcairnia squarrosa var. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that covers the entire plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing moisture for its roots. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are clustered in a spike."
