    "intro": "Phymatodes zosteriformis, commonly known as the zosteriform lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on soil surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The thallus is usually green or yellowish-green, with a smooth, leathery texture. It is characterized by its zosteriform (strap-like) growth pattern, which gives it its common name. This lichen is often found in regions with high humidity and is used as an indicator of soil moisture and environmental conditions."
