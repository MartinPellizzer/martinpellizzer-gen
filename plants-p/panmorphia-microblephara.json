    "intro": "Panmorphia microblephara, commonly known as the star-eyed orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with a unique arrangement of petals and sepals that resemble tiny eyes. The plant exhibits a delicate, compact growth habit with slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
