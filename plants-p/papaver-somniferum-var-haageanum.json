    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. haageanum, commonly known as the Haagean opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive floral morphology and medicinal significance. It features large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, with a prominent central stigma that aids in pollination. The plant is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its latex, extracted from the seed pods, contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, making it both a valuable and regulated plant. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is subject to strict legal controls in many countries."
