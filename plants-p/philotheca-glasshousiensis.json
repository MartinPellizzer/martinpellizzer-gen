    "intro": "Philotheca glasshousiensis, commonly known as the Glasshouse thornbush, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, grey-green foliage and spiny branches, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Philotheca glasshousiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
