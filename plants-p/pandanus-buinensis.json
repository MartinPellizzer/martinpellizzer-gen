    "intro": "Pandanus buinensis, commonly known as the Bui Island pandanus, is a species of palm-like plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-colored fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and baskets. Pandanus buinensis thrives in coastal and tropical environments, often growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
