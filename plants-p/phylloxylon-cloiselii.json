    "intro": "Phylloxylon cloiselii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
