It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy surface. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
