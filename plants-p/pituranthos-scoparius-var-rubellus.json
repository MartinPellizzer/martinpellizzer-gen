    "intro": "Pituranthos scoparius var. rubellus, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandbur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and pale green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spiny seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has ecological value in stabilizing soils."
