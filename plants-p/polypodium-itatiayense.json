    "intro": "Polypodium itatiayense, commonly known as the Itatiaya fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium itatiayense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
