    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland bentgrasses, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in harsh, high-altitude environments."
