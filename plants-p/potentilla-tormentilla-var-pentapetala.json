    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
