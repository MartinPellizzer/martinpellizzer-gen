    "intro": "Poa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
