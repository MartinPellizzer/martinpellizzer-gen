    "intro": "Phoradendron luisense var. luisense, commonly known as the Luisense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and hickories, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
