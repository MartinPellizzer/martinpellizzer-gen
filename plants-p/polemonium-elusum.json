    "intro": "Polemonium elusum, commonly known as the bluebells of the woods, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds in the fall. Polemonium elusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
