    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum mollifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
