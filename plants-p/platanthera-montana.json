    "intro": "Platanthera montana, commonly known as the mountain twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
