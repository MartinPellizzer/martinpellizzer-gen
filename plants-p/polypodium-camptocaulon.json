    "intro": "Polypodium camptocaulon, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along the rachis. Polypodium camptocaulon is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
