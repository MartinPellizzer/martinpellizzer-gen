    "intro": "Panopsis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf panopsis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and it produces small, clustered white or yellow flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
