    "intro": "Pilosella arvicola subsp. molendiana, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flower heads compared to other Pilosella species. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky soils, often at high altitudes. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and role in mountain ecosystems."
