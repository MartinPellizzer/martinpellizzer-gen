It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits, including narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern. Further research is needed to fully understand its botanical significance and ecological role."
