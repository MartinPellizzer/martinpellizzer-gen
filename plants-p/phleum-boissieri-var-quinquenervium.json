    "intro": "Phleum boissieri var. quinquenervium, commonly known as the five-veined oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct five veins running along the blade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
