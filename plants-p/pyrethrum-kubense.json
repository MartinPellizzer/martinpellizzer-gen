    "intro": "Pyrethrum kubense, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called phylloclades. These structures are the primary source of pyrethrins, natural insecticides used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum kubense thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and agricultural purposes."
