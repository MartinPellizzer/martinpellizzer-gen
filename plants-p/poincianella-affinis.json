    "intro": "Poincianella affinis, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and short lifespan, it is often used in landscaping for its seasonal visual impact."
