    "intro": "Psidiopsis, commonly known as the false guava, is a small shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Psidiopsis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
