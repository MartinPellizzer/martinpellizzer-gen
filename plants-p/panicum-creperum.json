    "intro": "Panicum creperum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum creperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
