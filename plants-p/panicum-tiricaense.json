    "intro": "Panicum tiricaense, commonly known as the Tirisca grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
