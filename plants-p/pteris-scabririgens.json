    "intro": "Pteris scabririgens, commonly known as the rough-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a rough, scaly texture on the underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Pteris scabririgens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
