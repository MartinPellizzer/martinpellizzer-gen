It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped or oval. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, star-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower displays."
