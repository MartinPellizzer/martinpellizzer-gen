    "intro": "Pteris fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris fournieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
