    "intro": "Pasaccardoa kaessneri, commonly known as the golden cup fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange cap, which is typically bell-shaped and covered in fine, wavy ridges. The stem is slender and often has a fibrous texture, while the gills are closely spaced and initially pale before darkening. This species thrives in moist, organic-rich soils, often found in forested areas. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a notable subject in mycological studies."
