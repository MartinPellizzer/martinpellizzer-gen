It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, preferring moist and cool conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Plocoglottis lobulata is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in forested areas."
