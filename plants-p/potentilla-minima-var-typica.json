    "intro": "Potentilla minima var. typica, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
