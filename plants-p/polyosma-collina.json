    "intro": "Polyosma collina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are white or pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
