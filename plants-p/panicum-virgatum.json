    "intro": "Panicum virgatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species prized for its ecological and agricultural benefits. It is a tall, perennial plant that typically grows between 1 to 3 meters in height, featuring narrow, bluish-green leaves and fluffy, silver-gray seed heads. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is highly drought-resistant, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its fibrous root system helps improve soil structure and nutrient cycling. The plant is also considered a promising bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
