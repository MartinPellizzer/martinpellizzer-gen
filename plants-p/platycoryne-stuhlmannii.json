    "intro": "Platycoryne stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's flat-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its broad, flat leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
