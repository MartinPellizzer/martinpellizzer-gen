    "intro": "Polypodium latealatum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates and absorb moisture efficiently. The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in suitable microhabitats."
