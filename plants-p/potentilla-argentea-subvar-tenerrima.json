    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. tenerrima, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, white-hairy covering on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
