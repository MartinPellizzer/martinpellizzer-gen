    "intro": "Pyrus syriaca var. boveana, commonly known as the Syrian white pear, is a botanical variant of the common pear. It is native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers in spring. Its fruit, which is typically small and yellowish, is edible but less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
