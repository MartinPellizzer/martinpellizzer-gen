It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
