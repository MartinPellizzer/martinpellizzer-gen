It features tall, slender stalks that produce vibrant red and orange plumes during the late summer and early fall. The plant is characterized by its fine, hairy texture on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fiery coloration and ability to add movement and texture to garden designs."
