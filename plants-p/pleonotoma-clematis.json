    "intro": "Pleonotoma clematis, commonly known as the Clematis beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is primarily found in regions where clematis plants are abundant, such as temperate zones in North America and Europe. The beetle's life cycle involves feeding on the leaves of clematis, which are its primary food source. Its larvae also feed on the foliage, contributing to the plant's damage. The beetle's coloration and patterns often mimic the appearance of the clematis leaves, providing a form of camouflage."
