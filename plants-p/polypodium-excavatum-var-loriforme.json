    "intro": "Polypodium excavatum var. loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
