    "intro": "Psammotropha myriantha var. huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
