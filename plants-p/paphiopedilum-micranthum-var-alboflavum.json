    "intro": "Paphiopedilum micranthum var. alboflavum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining characteristic of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with white and yellow markings, often with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, tropical climates."
