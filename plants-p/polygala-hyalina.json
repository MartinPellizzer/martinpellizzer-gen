    "intro": "Polygala hyalina, commonly known as the glassy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
