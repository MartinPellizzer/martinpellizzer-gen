    "intro": "Paronychia cephalotes subsp. thracica, commonly known as the Thrace mountain sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
