    "intro": "Pinus taxifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cedar or Chinese white pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature over a year, and its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Pinus taxifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
