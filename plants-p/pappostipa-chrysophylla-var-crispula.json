It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which is more pronounced in its juvenile stages. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
