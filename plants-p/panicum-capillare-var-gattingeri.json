    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. gattingeri, commonly known as Gattinger's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features slender, hair-like leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
