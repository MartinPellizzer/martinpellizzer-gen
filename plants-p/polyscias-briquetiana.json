    "intro": "Polyscias briquetiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian nettle, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Cook Islands. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Polyscias briquetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
