    "intro": "Phytolacca icosandra var. angustitepala, commonly known as narrow-leaved physic nut, is a variant of the physic nut plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, red or purple berries that contain toxic seeds. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
