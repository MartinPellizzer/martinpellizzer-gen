    "intro": "Populus subintegerrima var. berkanensis, commonly known as the Berkan's poplar, is a rare and specialized variant of the poplar genus native to specific regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a serrated margin and a dense, hairy underside. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often near streams or in woodland areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in catkins, and it relies on wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological and conservation value."
