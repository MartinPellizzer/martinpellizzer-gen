    "intro": "Pteris bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Pteris bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
