    "intro": "Parodia penicillata var. nivosa, commonly known as the Snowy Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a pale green to white body with dense, woolly covering that gives it a snow-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
