It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and alpine ecosystems. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. Phyllodoce floribunda plays an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and acidic habitats."
