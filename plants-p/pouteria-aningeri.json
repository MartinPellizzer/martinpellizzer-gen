    "intro": "Pouteria aningeri, commonly known as the white soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, gray bark and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, spiny fruits resembling a cross between a pineapple and a melon. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a mild citrus flavor, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
