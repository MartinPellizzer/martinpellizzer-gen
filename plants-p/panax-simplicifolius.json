    "intro": "Panax simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaf ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, unlobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries containing several seeds. Native to specific regions in East Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a valuable but endangered botanical species."
