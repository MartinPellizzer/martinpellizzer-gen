    "intro": "Pyrethrum inodorum var. salinum, commonly known as salt pyrethrum, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal gardens and areas with high salt content. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its natural resistance to pests, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens."
