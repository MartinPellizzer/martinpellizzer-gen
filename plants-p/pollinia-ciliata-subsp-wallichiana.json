    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata subsp. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The pollinia, which are unique to orchids, are clustered in a structure called a pollinarium, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism."
