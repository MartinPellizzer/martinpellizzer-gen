    "intro": "Pappostipa chrysophylla var. cordillerarum, commonly known as the Sierra grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to golden flowers, which are often clustered in dense, compact spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
