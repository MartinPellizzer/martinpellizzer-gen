    "intro": "Primula officinalis f. apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate primrose, is a botanical variant of the primrose species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The flowers are typically pale yellow to cream, with five petals and a distinctive, elongated spur at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its botanical significance also lies in its historical use in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain largely unverified in modern scientific studies."
