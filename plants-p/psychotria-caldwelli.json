    "intro": "Psychotria caldwelli, commonly known as Caldwell's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Panama and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
