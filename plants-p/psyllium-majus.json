    "intro": "Psyllium majus, commonly known as isabgol, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a capsule that contains fine, mucilaginous seeds, which are widely used in herbal medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement. These seeds, when soaked in water, form a gel-like substance that can aid in digestion and promote a feeling of fullness. Psyllium majus is also valued for its ability to improve soil structure and is sometimes used in organic farming practices."
