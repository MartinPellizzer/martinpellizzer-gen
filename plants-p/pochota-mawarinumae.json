    "intro": "Pochota mawarinumae, commonly known as the Mawari Pochota, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
