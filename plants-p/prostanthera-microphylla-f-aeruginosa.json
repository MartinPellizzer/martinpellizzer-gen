    "intro": "Prostanthera microphylla f. aeruginosa, commonly known as the blue-leaved honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a striking blue-gray in color, which helps to distinguish it from other Prostanthera species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
