    "intro": "Plagiobothrys scouleri var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, often in regions with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that mature in the fall. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by subtle differences in leaf shape and flower structure."
