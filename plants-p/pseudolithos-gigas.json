    "intro": "Pseudolithos gigas, commonly known as the giant rock plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Pseudolithos gigas is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
