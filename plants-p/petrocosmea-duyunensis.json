    "intro": "Petrocosmea duyunensis, commonly known as the Du Yun petrocosmea, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in Yunnan Province, China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates in mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
