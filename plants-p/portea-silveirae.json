    "intro": "Portea silveirae, commonly known as the Silveira's evergreen shrub, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
