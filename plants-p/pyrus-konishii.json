    "intro": "Pyrus konishii, commonly known as the Konishi pear, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by fruit that ripens in late summer. The fruit is typically small, with a sweet and crisp flesh, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use. Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is often grown in botanical gardens and private collections."
