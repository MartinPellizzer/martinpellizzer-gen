    "intro": "Pycnostachys, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and showy, brightly colored flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and dark green, often with a waxy texture. Pycnostachys species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their attractive foliage. They produce small, tubular flowers that are often clustered together in a spike-like inflorescence."
