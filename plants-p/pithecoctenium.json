    "intro": "Pithecoctenium, commonly known as the African marshmallow, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by their herbaceous or shrub-like growth forms. They typically feature palmate leaves and produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to their dispersal in natural habitats. Pithecoctenium species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
