    "intro": "Potentilla dissecta var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the dissected cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
