    "intro": "Potamogeton roxburghianus, commonly known as the river grass, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often found in slow-moving or still waters. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life. Potamogeton roxburghianus is an important species in wetland ecosystems and can be used for phytoremediation."
