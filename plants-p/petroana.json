    "intro": "Petroana, commonly known as the rock fig, is a unique plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its fruit is edible, though not widely consumed by humans. Petroana plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
