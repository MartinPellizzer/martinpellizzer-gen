    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are characterized by their bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky appearance. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and they produce pods that contain seeds. Pseudalbizzia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
