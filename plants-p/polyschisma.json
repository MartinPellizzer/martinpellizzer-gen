    "intro": "Polyschisma, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. Polyschisma has a taproot system and produces a milky sap that can be toxic to livestock. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its invasive tendencies in some regions."
