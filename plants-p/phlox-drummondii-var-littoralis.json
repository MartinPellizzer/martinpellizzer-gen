    "intro": "Phlox drummondii var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal phlox, is a variant of the common garden phlox native to the coastal regions of the United States. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments where salt spray is common. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and support local biodiversity."
