    "intro": "Pyrethrum tanacetoides, commonly known as African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk floret. The plant produces a yellowish-green flower head that contains numerous small, glandular structures called trichomes. These trichomes secrete pyrethrin, a natural insecticide used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum tanacetoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its utility in botanical pesticides."
