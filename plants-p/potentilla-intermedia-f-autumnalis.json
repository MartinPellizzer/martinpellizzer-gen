    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia f. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape during the transition seasons. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
