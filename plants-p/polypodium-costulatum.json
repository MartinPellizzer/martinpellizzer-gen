    "intro": "Polypodium costulatum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges and a light green to grayish-green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
