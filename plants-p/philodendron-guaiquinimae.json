It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
