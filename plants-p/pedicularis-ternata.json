    "intro": "Pedicularis ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and bright orange or red tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies. Pedicularis ternata is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where it partially relies on host plants for nutrients."
