    "intro": "Pteridium caudatum subsp. arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
