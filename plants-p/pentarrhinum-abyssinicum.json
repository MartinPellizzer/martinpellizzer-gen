    "intro": "Pentarrhinum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian five-lobed plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Ethiopia and is characterized by its striking, five-lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
