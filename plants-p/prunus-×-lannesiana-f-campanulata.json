    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. campanulata, commonly known as the campanulata cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub prized for its showy, bell-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Prunus genus, which includes cherries, plums, and peaches, and is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Prunus lannesiana and other Prunus species. The plant is characterized by its dense foliage, which provides a lush backdrop for its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically grown in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively low maintenance once established. This cultivar is well-suited to USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8, making it adaptable to a variety of temperate climates."
