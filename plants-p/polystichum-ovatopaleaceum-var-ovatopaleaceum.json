    "intro": "Polystichum ovatopaleaceum var. ovatopaleaceum, commonly known as the ovate paleaceum fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically ovate in shape and have a pale, sometimes bluish-green hue. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
