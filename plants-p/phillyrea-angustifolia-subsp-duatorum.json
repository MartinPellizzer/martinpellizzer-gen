It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces white, tubular flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Phillyrea angustifolia."
