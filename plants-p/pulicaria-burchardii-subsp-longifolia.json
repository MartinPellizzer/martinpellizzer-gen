    "intro": "Pulicaria burchardii subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with small, narrow leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
