    "intro": "Paepalanthus uleanus, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a unique liverwort species belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Paepalanthus uleanus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
