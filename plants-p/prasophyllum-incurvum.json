    "intro": "Prasophyllum incurvum, commonly known as the sickle-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
