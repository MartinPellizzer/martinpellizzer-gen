    "intro": "Pseudopanax laetevirens, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. The species is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living over 100 years."
