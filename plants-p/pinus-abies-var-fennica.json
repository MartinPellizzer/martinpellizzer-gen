    "intro": "Pinus abies var. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish white pine, is a variant of the white pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical white pine. The tree produces pale yellow to reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
