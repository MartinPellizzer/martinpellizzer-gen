    "intro": "Pedicularis tenoreana, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the shape of a monkey's face. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
