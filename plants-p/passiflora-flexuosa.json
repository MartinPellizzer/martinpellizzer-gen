    "intro": "Passiflora flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by wildlife and humans. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Passiflora flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other fauna."
