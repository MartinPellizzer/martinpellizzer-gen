    "intro": "Prunus incana var. sintenisii, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a variant of the Prunus incana species native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are pale pink to white, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that ripens in late summer."
