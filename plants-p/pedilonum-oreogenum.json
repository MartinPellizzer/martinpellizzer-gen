    "intro": "Pedilonum oreogenum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid mountain conditions. Pedilonum oreogenum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
