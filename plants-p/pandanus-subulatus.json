    "intro": "Pandanus subulatus, commonly known as the needle pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, coastal environments. Pandanus subulatus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
