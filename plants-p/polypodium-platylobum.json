    "intro": "Polypodium platylobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic species, often found on rocks or tree trunks in shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often clustered at the base."
