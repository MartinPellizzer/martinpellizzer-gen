    "intro": "Pteris lineata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris lineata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
