    "intro": "Prunus communis proles subinermis, commonly known as the common cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, sweet, edible fruits called cherries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The subspecies subinermis is distinguished by its lack of thorns, making it more suitable for garden settings."
