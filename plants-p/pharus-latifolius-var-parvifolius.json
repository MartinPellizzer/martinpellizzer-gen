    "intro": "Pharus latifolius var. parvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pharus, is a lesser-known species within the Pharus genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
