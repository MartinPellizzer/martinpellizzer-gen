    "intro": "Pectinariella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often blue or purple, bract-like leaves that resemble the petals of a flower. They are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, showing a high tolerance for salt and sandy soils. Pectinariella species are herbaceous, often with a rosette growth form, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Their botanical features make them well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
