    "intro": "Podosperma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, showy flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release seeds. Podosperma angustifolium is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
