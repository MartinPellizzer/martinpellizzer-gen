    "intro": "Prunus cerasus f. plena, commonly known as the double cherry or double sweet cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its dense, double flowers. It originates from the Prunus cerasus species, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features showy, clustered blooms that give it a particularly ornamental appearance in spring. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the fruit is typically smaller than standard cherries. This variety is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production."
