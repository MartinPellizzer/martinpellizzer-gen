    "intro": "Puya vallo-grandensis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean highlands of South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to several feet in length. It produces tall inflorescences bearing small, spadix-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
