    "intro": "Peucedanum acronemifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Peucedanum acronemifolium is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
