    "intro": "Persicaria minor subsp. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf smartweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which bloom from mid-summer to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in wetland gardens."
