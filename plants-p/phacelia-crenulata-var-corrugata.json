    "intro": "Phacelia crenulata var. corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, corrugated leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its showy blooms and hairy stems. The corrugated texture of its leaves is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in water retention and distinguishes it from other phacelia species."
