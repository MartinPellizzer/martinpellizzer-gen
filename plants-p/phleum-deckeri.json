    "intro": "Phleum deckeri, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Phleum deckeri thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
