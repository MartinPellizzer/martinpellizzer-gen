It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, branched panicles. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
