    "intro": "Prunus grayana, commonly known as the Himalayan cherry or the pink flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth texture. Its fruits are small, dark red drupes that develop after the flowers. Prunus grayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy spring blossoms."
