    "intro": "Plantago amplexicaulis subsp. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory and digestive systems."
