    "intro": "Phalaris minor var. mouterdei, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it a hardy species often found in dunes and tidal flats. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects."
