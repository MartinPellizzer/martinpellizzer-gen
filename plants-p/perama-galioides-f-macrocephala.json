    "intro": "Perama galioides f. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed swamp rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flower heads compared to other forms of Perama galioides."
