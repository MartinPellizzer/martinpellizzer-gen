    "intro": "Plectritis congesta subsp. nitida, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
