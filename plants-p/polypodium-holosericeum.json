    "intro": "Polypodium holosericeum, commonly known as the silky rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Polypodium holosericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
