    "intro": "Pleurothallis colossus, commonly known as the giant pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Despite its impressive size, it is relatively rare and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
