    "intro": "Podocarpus rostratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf podocarp, is a evergreen coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Podocarpus rostratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
