    "intro": "Primula fistulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. Primula fistulosa is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
