    "intro": "Pseudencyclia semiaperta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces small, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Native to the subtropical regions of southern China, it thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
