    "intro": "Pyrus leveillei, commonly known as the Leveille's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
