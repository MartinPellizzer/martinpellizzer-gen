    "intro": "Prunus communis congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a notable ornamental plant. The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
