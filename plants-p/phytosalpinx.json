    "intro": "Phytosalpinx, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and often have leaves that are alternate and simple. Phytosalpinx species are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated for their attractive foliage. However, many species are also valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
