    "intro": "Paspalum bushii, commonly known as the bushy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage, which gives it a bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. Paspalum bushii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
