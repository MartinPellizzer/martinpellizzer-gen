    "intro": "Pilocereus lanuginosus var. virens, commonly known as the green-hairy night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to grayish-white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are cylindrical and segmented, with spines that provide protection from herbivores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens for its unique appearance and nighttime blooms."
