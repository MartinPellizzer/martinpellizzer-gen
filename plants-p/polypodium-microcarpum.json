    "intro": "Polypodium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited water fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of root hairs. The small, spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of its fronds."
