    "intro": "Polystichum pseudodeltoden, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Polystichum pseudodeltoden is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
