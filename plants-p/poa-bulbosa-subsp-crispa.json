    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. crispa, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, slightly curled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
