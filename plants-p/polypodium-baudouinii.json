    "intro": "Polypodium baudouinii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself securely in its habitat. The fronds are often divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive, architectural appearance."
