    "intro": "Pholidia, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pholidia tanacetifolia, which is native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow, star-shaped fruits that resemble the fruit of the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a slightly waxy texture. Pholidia species are often found in woodland and scrub habitats, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife."
