    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. grande, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The varietal form *grande* distinguishes it from other varieties by its notably larger size and robust growth habit."
