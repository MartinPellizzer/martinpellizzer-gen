    "intro": "Preissia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine. Preissia species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers in clusters. They are adapted to arid environments and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
