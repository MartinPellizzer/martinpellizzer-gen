    "intro": "Penstemon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its showy flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon pubescens is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
