It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in grasslands and shrublands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces an underground bulb that serves as a storage organ for nutrients, enabling it to survive dry periods. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
