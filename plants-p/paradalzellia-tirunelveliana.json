    "intro": "Paradalzellia tirunelveliana, commonly known as the Tirunelveli fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the southern regions of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
