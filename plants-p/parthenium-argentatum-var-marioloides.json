    "intro": "Parthenium argentatum var. marioloides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a hairy stem and leaves with a distinct, bitter taste. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many regions."
