    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. rurivagum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy and can spread via stolons. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
