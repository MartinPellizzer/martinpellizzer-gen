    "intro": "Pentameris borussica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its flowers have five petals, which is reflected in its genus name, and are arranged in a raceme. Pentameris borussica is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
