    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a prostrate or ascending manner. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along pathways, and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
