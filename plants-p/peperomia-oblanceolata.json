    "intro": "Peperomia oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, clustered in spikes at the ends of stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
