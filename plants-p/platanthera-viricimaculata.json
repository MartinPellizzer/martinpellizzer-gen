    "intro": "Platanthera viricimaculata, commonly known as the green-spotted pterostylis, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive green spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and stable temperatures."
