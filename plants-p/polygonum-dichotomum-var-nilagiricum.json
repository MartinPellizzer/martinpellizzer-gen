    "intro": "Polygonum dichotomum var. nilagiricum, commonly known as the Nilagiri knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Western Ghats in India. It is characterized by its stout, erect stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
