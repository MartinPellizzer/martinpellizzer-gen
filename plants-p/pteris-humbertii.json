    "intro": "Pteris humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and arching in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris humbertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
