    "intro": "Pitcairnia ctenophylla, commonly known as the feather-leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are long, narrow, and covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
