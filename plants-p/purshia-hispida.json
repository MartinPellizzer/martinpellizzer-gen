    "intro": "Purshia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its grayish bark, spiny branches, and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, ribbed fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. Purshia hispida is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
