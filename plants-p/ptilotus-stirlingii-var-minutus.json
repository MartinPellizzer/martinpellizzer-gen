    "intro": "Ptilotus stirlingii var. minutus, commonly known as the dwarf spinifex, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize transpiration. It is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
