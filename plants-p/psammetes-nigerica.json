    "intro": "Psammetes nigerica, commonly known as the black sand dune grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, adapted to the harsh conditions of sandy soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Psammetes nigerica is well-suited to environments with high salinity and limited water availability."
