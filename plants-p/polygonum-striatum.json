    "intro": "Polygonum striatum, commonly known as the stripeleaf smartweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins that give it its characteristic striped appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Polygonum striatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
