    "intro": "Phacelia inyoensis, commonly known as Inyo phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Phacelia inyoensis is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in California and Nevada."
