    "intro": "Poa compressoformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are compressed and flat, with a distinctive blue-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa compressoformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
