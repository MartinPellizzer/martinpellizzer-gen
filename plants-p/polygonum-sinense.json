The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Polygonum sinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
