    "intro": "Phacelurus latifolius var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phacelurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems and lanceolate leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated foliage and is often found in wetter environments compared to its broader-leaved counterpart."
