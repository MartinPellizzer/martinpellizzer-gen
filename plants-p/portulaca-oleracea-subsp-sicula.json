It features fleshy, thick leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Sicilian purslane is edible and has been used in traditional cuisines for its mild, slightly tart flavor."
