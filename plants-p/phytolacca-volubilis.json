    "intro": "Phytolacca volubilis, commonly known as the climbing Physostegia, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to climb, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
