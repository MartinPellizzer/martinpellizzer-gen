    "intro": "Potentilla ancistrifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for horticultural use."
