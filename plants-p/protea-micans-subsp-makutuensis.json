    "intro": "Protea micans subsp. makutuensis, commonly known as the Makutuensis protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of the fynbos biome. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in coastal and mountainous regions of South Africa, where it contributes to the region's rich floral diversity."
