    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata var. leopoliensis, commonly known as the Leopoliensis cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and serrated, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays in colder climates."
