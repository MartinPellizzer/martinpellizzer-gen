    "intro": "Pitcairnia betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Pitcairnia betancurii is a popular epiphytic plant among bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
