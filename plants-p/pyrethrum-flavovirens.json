    "intro": "Pyrethrum flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow-orange petals and green centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it effective for pest control in organic gardening. Pyrethrum flavovirens thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal cultivation."
