    "intro": "Psathyrostachys desertorum, commonly known as the desert wild rye, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typically blooming in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
