    "intro": "Pinus bullata, commonly known as the white pine or silver pine, is a species of conifer native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically white to silver in color. The cones of Pinus bullata are relatively small and usually hang downward, maturing over several years. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a notable plant in its native habitat."
