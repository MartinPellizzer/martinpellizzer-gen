    "intro": "Pteris caiyangheensis, commonly known as the Caiyanghe water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
