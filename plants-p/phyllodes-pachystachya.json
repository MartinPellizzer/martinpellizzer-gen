    "intro": "Phyllodes pachystachya, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, flat, green phyllodes that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal and arid garden settings."
