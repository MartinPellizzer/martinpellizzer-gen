It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring margins that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The foliage and fruit make it a valuable plant for wildlife, particularly birds, which rely on it for food."
