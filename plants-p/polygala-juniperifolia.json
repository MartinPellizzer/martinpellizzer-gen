    "intro": "Polygala juniperifolia, commonly known as the juniperleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that resemble juniper needles. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid ecosystem biodiversity."
