    "intro": "Phragmotheca hydra, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats. Phragmotheca hydra is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
