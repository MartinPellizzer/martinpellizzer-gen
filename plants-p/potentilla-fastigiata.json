    "intro": "Potentilla fastigiata, commonly known as the upright cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
