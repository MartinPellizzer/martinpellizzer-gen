    "intro": "Polystichum webbianum, commonly known as the Webb's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
