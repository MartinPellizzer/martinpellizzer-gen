    "intro": "Populus pseudoglauca, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. This species is often found in moist soils near rivers and streams, showcasing its adaptability to wetland environments."
