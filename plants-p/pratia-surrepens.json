    "intro": "Pratia surrepens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Pratia surrepens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas and along stream banks."
