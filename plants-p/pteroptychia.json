    "intro": "Pteroptychia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Pteroptychia is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
