    "intro": "Pteris acrostica, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Pteris acrostica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
