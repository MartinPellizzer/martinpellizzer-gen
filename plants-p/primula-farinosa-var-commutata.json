    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. commutata, commonly known as the Commutated Primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it the species name \"farinosa,\" which means \"flour-like.\" The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
