    "intro": "Pisonia olfersiana, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saline water, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its roots form dense networks that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Pisonia olfersiana plays a vital role in supporting marine and terrestrial biodiversity in its habitat."
