    "intro": "Procris caudata, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Procris caudata is considered a rare and endangered species."
