It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to ovate leaflets, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. This hardy species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in disturbed or exposed environments."
