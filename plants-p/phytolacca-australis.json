    "intro": "Phytolacca australis, commonly known as the Australian pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Australia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with smooth, often reddish bark. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Phytolacca australis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas."
