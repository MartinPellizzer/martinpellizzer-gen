    "intro": "Pleurothyrium hexaglandulosum, commonly known as the six-gland pleurothyrium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with six prominent glands on the underside. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
