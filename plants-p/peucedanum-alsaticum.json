    "intro": "Peucedanum alsaticum, commonly known as love turnip or cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust taproot and a tall, branched stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine for their carminative and digestive properties. The plant is also valued in culinary applications, particularly in soups and stews."
