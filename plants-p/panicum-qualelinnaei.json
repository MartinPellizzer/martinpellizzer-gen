    "intro": "Panicum qualelinnaei, commonly known as the Queensland panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
