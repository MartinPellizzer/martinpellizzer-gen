    "intro": "Picea abies var. finedonensis, commonly known as the Finedon pine, is a rare variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features longer, more slender needles compared to the typical Norway spruce. This variety is native to a limited area in the UK, specifically the Finedon region in Gloucestershire. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and genetic distinctiveness. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
