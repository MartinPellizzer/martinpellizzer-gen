    "intro": "Phreatia evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces large, showy flowers with intricate patterns of white, pink, and purple, often resembling a ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
