    "intro": "Pyrethrum fruticosum, commonly known as the shrub pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are the primary source of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide. Pyrethrum fruticosum thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental purposes and pest control applications."
