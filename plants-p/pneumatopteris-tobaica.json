    "intro": "Pneumatopteris tobaica, commonly known as the Toba water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris tobaica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
