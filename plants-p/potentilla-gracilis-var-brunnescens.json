It features slender, wiry stems that are often tinged with a reddish or brownish hue, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
