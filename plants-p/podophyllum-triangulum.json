    "intro": "Podophyllum triangulum, commonly known as the three-lobed mayapple, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive umbrella-shaped cluster of leaves, with three deeply lobed leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its roots contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
