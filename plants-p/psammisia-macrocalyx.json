It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, often purple or pink, five-petaled flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It typically blooms in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Psammisia macrocalyx is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions."
