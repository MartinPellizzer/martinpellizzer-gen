    "intro": "Pernettyopsis subglabra, commonly known as the smooth pernettya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Tasmania, Australia, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
