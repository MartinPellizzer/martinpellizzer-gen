    "intro": "Platystele pisifera, commonly known as the leafy ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, humid environments, typically in the understory of tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower with white petals and a greenish-yellow labellum. It is found primarily in the Andes, spanning countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
