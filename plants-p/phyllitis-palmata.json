    "intro": "Phyllitis palmata, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a dense cluster of yellow flowers at the top of a tall, leafless stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often submerged or partially submerged in shallow water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Phyllitis palmata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
