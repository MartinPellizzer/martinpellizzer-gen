    "intro": "Protorhus oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oblong in shape and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Protorhus oblongifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
