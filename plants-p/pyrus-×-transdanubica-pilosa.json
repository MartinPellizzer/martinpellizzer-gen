    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 transdanubica pilosa, commonly known as the Transdanubian pear, is a hybrid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and medium-sized, oval-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, especially along the veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits with a slightly tart flavor. It is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and fruit production in horticultural settings."
