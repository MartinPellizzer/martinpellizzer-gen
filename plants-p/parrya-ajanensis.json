    "intro": "Parrya ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya ajanensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
