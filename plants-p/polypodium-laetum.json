    "intro": "Polypodium laetum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, especially when young. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium laetum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
