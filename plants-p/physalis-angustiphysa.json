    "intro": "Physalis angustiphysa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed groundcherries, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and pairs of opposite, narrow, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, greenish-brown calyces enclosing small, orange-red berries. These berries are typically harvested when they naturally split open, revealing the edible seeds inside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides."
