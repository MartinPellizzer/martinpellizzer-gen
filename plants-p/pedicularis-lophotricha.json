    "intro": "Pedicularis lophotricha, commonly known as the hairy-lipped monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red or purple markings. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas at high elevations, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
