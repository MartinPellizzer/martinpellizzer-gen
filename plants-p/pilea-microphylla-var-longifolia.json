    "intro": "Pilea microphylla var. longifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or pancake plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its easy care and attractive, coin-shaped foliage."
