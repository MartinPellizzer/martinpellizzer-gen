    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 bollwylleriana, commonly known as the Bollwyller pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Asian pear). It is characterized by its medium-sized, sweet, and juicy fruits with a crisp texture. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree with broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The Bollwyller pear is also valued for its cold hardiness and disease resistance."
