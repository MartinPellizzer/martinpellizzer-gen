    "intro": "Pteris confusa, commonly known as the confused water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris confusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
