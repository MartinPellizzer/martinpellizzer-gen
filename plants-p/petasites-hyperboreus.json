    "intro": "Petasites hyperboreus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Petasites hyperboreus plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitats."
