    "intro": "Pedicularis rostrata var. caespitosa, commonly known as the spurred gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base of the petals. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
