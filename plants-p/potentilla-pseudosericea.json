It is characterized by its softly hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
