    "intro": "Parthenostachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Parthenostachys has a short flowering period and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
