    "intro": "Polycarpon moreiranum, commonly known as the Moreira's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its adaptability and growth habits, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
