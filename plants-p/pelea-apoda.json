It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, almost thread-like leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Pelea apoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
