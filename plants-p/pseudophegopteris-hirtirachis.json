    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are pinnately divided with hairy veins that give it its common name. This rare fern is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
