    "intro": "Polypodium heterocarpoides, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
