    "intro": "Polypodium assurgens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium assurgens is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
