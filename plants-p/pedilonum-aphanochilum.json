    "intro": "Pedilonum aphanochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a lithophyte. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
