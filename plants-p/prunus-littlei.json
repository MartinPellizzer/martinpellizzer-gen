    "intro": "Prunus littlei, commonly known as the Littleleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Prunus littlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
