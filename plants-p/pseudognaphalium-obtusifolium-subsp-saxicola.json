    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flower heads, which are typically arranged in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
