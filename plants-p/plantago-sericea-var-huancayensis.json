    "intro": "Plantago sericea var. huancayensis, commonly known as the Huancayo velvet plant, is a variant of the common plantain native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescent leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in Andean communities."
