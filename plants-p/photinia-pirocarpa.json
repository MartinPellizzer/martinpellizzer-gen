    "intro": "Photinia pirocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered photinia, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant red blooms. Photinia pirocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
