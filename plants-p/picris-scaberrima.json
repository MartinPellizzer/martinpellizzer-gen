    "intro": "Picris scaberrima, commonly known as the rough hawk's-beard, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often covered with stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive pungent odor. Picris scaberrima is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
