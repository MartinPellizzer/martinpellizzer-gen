    "intro": "Pleione treutleri, commonly known as the Treutler's orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces strikingly beautiful, showy flowers with a wide range of colors, often in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant typically blooms in spring, with flowers emerging from a single stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant. Pleione treutleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cool, humid environments."
