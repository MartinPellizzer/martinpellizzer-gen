    "intro": "Polystichum nepalense f. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the subbipinnate wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond structure. It features a tall, slender rhizome with pinnately compound leaves that are finely divided into subpinnate segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a slightly glossy surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and mountainous regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
