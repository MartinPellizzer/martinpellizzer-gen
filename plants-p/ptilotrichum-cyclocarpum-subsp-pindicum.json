    "intro": "Ptilotrichum cyclocarpum subsp. pindicum, commonly known as the Pindus cyclocarpum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, orb-shaped fruits that mature to a dark brown color. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
