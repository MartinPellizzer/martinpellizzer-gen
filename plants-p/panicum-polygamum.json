It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture. Panicum polygamum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant landscapes."
