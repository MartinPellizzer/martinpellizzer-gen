    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata subsp. capitata, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers in the summer, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its medicinal uses and its ability to colonize areas quickly."
