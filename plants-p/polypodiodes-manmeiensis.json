    "intro": "Polypodiodes manmeiensis, commonly known as the Manmeien fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
