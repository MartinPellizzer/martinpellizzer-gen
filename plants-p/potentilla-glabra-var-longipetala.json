    "intro": "Potentilla glabra var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its flowers have five elongated petals, giving it the common name, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-elevation ecosystems."
