    "intro": "Prosaptia rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-bark cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its bark is thick and fibrous, often displaying a reddish hue, which contributes to its common name. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
