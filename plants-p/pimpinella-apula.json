    "intro": "Pimpinella apula, commonly known as the Balkan cow-wheat, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils across the Balkans. The plant features finely divided, pinnate leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit known as a schizocarp. Pimpinella apula is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
