    "intro": "Plectronia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny plectronia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a protective mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
