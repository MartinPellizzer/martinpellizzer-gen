    "intro": "Polypodium marthae, commonly known as the Marthae fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Polypodium marthae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
