    "intro": "Paspalum oajacense, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it well-suited for dune stabilization. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion. Paspalum oajacense is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
