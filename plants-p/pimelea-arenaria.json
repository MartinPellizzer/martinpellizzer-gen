    "intro": "Pimelea arenaria, commonly known as the sand pimelea, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low-nutrient environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer to autumn. It is well-suited to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established. Pimelea arenaria is often used in native gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
