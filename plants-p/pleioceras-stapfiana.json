It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and leaf structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small, clustered, and exhibit a striking coloration that aids in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
