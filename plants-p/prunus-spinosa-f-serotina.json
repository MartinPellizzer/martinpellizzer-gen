    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering blackthorn, is a flowering shrub characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries. It typically blooms later in the season compared to the typical Prunus spinosa, with flowers appearing in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the fruit is a key food source for birds and small mammals. The botanical features of this form make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
