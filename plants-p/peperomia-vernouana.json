It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
