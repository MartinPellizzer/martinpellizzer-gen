    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. elongatum, commonly known as tall switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a prominent feature in prairie ecosystems. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough texture. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, feathery inflorescences that are both ornamental and valuable for wildlife. Tall switchgrass is also widely cultivated for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and adaptability to various soil conditions."
