    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. alatomultifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its fronds are usually unbranched and have a smooth, glossy surface. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polypodium vulgare."
