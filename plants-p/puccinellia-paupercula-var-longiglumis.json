    "intro": "Puccinellia paupercula var. longiglumis, commonly known as the longawn puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or saline environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
