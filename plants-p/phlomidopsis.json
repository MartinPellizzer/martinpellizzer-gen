    "intro": "Phlomidopsis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeraliaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Phlomidopsis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are submerged, while their stems and leaves are partially or fully exposed to the air. The flowers of Phlomidopsis play an important role in attracting pollinators like beetles and flies."
