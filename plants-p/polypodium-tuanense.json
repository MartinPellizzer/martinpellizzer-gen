    "intro": "Polypodium tuanense, commonly known as the Tuanese cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its densely packed, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to challenging habitats."
