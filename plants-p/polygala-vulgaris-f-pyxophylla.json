    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris f. pyxophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygalaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow and opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
