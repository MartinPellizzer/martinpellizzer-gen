    "intro": "Paralabatia chrysophyllifolia, commonly known as the golden-leaf paralabatia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, golden-green cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
