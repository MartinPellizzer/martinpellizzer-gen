    "intro": "Pyrus dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomitic Crabapple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and edible fruits. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features alternate, simple leaves. The fruit, which is a small apple-like berry, ripens in the fall and is used both for ornamental purposes and in traditional medicine."
