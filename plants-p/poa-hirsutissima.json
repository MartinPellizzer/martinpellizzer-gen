    "intro": "Poa hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy poa, is a species of grass native to the cold, alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Poa hirsutissima is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
