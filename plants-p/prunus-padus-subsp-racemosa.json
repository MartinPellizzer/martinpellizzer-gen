    "intro": "Prunus padus subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the white-flowered bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender branches, which often form a weeping or pendulous habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red drupes in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have a serrated margin. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a street tree."
