    "intro": "Parosela juncea, commonly known as the slender parosela, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Apiaceae family."
