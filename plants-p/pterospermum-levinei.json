    "intro": "Pterospermum levinei, commonly known as the Malabar silk-cotton tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules that release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
