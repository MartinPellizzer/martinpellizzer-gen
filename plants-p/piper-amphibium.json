It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing tiny seeds. Piper amphibium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas."
