    "intro": "Peucedanum sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
