    "intro": "Pteridium capense, commonly known as the Natal grass or Natal bracken, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect, and often branched fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and disturbed areas, and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions. Its spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, sporangia clusters. Pteridium capense plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
