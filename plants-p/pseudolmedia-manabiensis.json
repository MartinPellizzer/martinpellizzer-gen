    "intro": "Pseudolmedia manabiensis, commonly known as the Manabi pseudolmedia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
