    "intro": "Pyrus rosea, commonly known as the pink pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
