It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and the stems are woody and branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
