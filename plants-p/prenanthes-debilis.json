    "intro": "Prenanthes debilis, commonly known as slender bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. These bladders are specialized cells that help the plant trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Prenanthes debilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
