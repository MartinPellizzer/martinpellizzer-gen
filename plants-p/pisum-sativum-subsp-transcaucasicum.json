It is a climbing legume with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, and it thrives in temperate climates. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than the common garden pea but is valued for its hardiness and adaptability."
