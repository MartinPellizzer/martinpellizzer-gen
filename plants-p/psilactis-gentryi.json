    "intro": "Psilactis gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's psilactis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
