    "intro": "Peucedanum aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into oval, orange-brown fruits, which are the primary source of its aromatic compounds. Its roots and stems contain volatile oils, making it a valuable species in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. However, due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
