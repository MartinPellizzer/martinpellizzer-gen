    "intro": "Palaquium sericeum var. sericeum, commonly known as the silky palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-green bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
