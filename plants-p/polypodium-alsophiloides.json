    "intro": "Polypodium alsophiloides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, glossy appearance."
