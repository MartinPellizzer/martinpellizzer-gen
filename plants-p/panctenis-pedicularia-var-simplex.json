    "intro": "Panctenis pedicularia var. simplex, commonly known as the simple stickseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
