It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of grasses. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Peristrophe gillilandiorum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
