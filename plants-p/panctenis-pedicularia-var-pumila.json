    "intro": "Panctenis pedicularia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf stickyweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, giving it its common name. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
