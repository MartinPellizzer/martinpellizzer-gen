    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin."
