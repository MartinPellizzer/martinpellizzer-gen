    "intro": "Pyrola subaphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf wintergreen, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, moist forest habitat. Pyrola subaphylla is often found in shaded, acidic soils and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
