    "intro": "Phlegmariurus obovalifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporophytes with erect, cylindrical strobili that bear spores, typical of clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky soils. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
