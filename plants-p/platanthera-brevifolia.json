    "intro": "Platanthera brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that bears two small, lance-shaped leaves near the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its root system is specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake."
