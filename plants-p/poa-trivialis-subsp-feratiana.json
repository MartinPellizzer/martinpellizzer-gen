    "intro": "Poa trivialis subsp. feratiana, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green or purplish in color. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes and is well adapted to a variety of soil conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it both a desirable groundcover and a common weed in cultivated areas."
