    "intro": "Platymiscium trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has historically been used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
