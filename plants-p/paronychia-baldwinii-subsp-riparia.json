    "intro": "Paronychia baldwinii subsp. riparia, commonly known as the riparian paronychia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other riparian habitats. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
