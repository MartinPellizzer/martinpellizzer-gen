    "intro": "Platanthera alpinipaludosa, commonly known as the alpine marsh twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces small, greenish-white flowers. This plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant is typically found in northern hemisphere regions, including Europe, Asia, and North America."
