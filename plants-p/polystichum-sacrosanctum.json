    "intro": "Polystichum sacrosanctum, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. The fronds are known for their durability and are sometimes used in traditional crafts or as ornamental plants in gardens."
