    "intro": "Polypodium confertum, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with a dense, compact frond that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
