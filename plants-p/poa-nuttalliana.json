    "intro": "Poa nuttalliana, commonly known as Nuttall's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
