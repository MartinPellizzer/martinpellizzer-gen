It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and distinctive wavy margins on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife."
