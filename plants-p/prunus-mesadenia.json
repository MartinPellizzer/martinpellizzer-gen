    "intro": "Prunus mesadenia, commonly known as the Australian cherry or mesadenia cherry, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus mesadenia is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal environments with minimal water requirements."
