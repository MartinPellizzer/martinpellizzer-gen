    "intro": "Pennisetum gracile, commonly known as slender fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and fluffy, white plumes that appear in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to attract birds and butterflies."
