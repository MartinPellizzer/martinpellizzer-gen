    "intro": "Pterophylla rapensis, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Pterophylla rapensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
