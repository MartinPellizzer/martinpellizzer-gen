    "intro": "Pereskia horrida subsp. rauhii, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and often have a woody texture. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, followed by edible fruits known as prickly pears. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its unique structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh climates."
