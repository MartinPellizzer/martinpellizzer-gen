It typically features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale green, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, making it a common component of ground cover in its native habitat."
