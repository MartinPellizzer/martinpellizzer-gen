    "intro": "Potentilla rolandii var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
