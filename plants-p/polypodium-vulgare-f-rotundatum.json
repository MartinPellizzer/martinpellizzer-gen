    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded lobes on the fronds, which set it apart from the typical form. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. This fern is typically evergreen, with a slow growth rate and a preference for well-drained, acidic soil."
