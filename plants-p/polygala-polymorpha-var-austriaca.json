    "intro": "Polygala polymorpha var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
