    "intro": "Paropsiopsis zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's paropsiopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
