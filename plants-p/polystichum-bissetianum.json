    "intro": "Polystichum bissetianum, commonly known as the Bisset's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorangia."
