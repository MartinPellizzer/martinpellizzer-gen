    "intro": "Pyrus afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are generally smaller and more tart in flavor. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in regions with limited water availability. The plant has historical significance in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
