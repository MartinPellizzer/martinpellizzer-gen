It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. In spring, it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by small, dark purple berries. The berries are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant contains toxic compounds in its leaves and stems."
