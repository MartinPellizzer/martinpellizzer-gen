It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phlomis \u00d7 kalanensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
