It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
