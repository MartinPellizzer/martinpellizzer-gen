It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting white flowers with subtle green veins, which distinguish it from other Phalaenopsis varieties. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
