    "intro": "Psidium striatulum var. paranense, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cara\u00edba*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated margin and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its edible red, cherry-like fruits that are rich in vitamin C and often consumed fresh or processed into jams. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
