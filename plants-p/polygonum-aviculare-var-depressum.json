    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. depressum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetland areas. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated settings."
