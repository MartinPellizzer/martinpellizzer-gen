    "intro": "Papaver dubium proles modestum, commonly known as the modest scarlet poppy, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the poppy family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to scarlet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its stem is slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
