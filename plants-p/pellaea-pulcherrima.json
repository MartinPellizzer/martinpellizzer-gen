    "intro": "Pellaea pulcherrima, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and its striking, bright yellow to golden-green fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This plant is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
