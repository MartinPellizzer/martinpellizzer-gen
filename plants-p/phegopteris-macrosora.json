    "intro": "Phegopteris macrosora, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its expansive, floating fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnate segments, with each leaflet bearing small, toothed margins. The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
