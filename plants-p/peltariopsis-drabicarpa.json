    "intro": "Peltariopsis drabicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peltariopsis, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
