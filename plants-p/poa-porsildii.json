    "intro": "Poa porsildii, commonly known as the Porsild's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Poa porsildii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environment and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
