    "intro": "Polystichum liui, commonly known as the Liui cliff brake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, such as cliffs and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
