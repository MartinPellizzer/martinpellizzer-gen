    "intro": "Physocarpus opulifolius var. tomentellus, commonly known as the silver-leaf ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its heart-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is more compact than the typical ninebark, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
