    "intro": "Pulassarium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a broad, spreading canopy with large, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
