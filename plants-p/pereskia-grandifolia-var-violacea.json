    "intro": "Pereskia grandifolia var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-stemmed cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are often covered in a bluish or violet hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically small and may be present on younger stems, while mature plants often have reduced foliage. Pereskia grandifolia var. violacea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
