It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black fruits, which are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant is native to the Balkan region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible, though tart, fruits. The species is notable for its adaptability and resilience to various environmental conditions."
