    "intro": "Polypodium procerum, commonly known as the tall cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium procerum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms."
