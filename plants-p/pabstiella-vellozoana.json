    "intro": "Pabstiella vellozoana, commonly known as the Vellozoan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a short rhizome and produces few, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are characterized by their unique structure, with a spurred lip that is distinct from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
