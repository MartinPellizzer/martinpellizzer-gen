    "intro": "Pilosocereus hermentianus, commonly known as the Hermentia cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Bolivia. It is a spineless cactus with a globular shape and often develops a crown of tubercles as it matures. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
