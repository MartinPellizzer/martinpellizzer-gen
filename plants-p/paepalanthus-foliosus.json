    "intro": "Paepalanthus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive branching pattern that resembles a candelabra. The plant features spiny stems and produces yellow flowers during the flowering season. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun for optimal growth."
