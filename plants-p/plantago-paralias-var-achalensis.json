    "intro": "Plantago paralias var. achalensis, commonly known as the Achalensis plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
