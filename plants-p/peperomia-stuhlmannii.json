    "intro": "Peperomia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features oval, waxy, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
