    "intro": "Pandanus patelliformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, making them useful for making thatch and ropes. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline."
