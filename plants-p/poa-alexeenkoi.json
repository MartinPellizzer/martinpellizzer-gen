    "intro": "Poa alexeenkoi, commonly known as the Alexeenko's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa alexeenkoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
