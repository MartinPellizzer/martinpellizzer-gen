    "intro": "Parsonsia rosea, commonly known as the red lily or the flame lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
