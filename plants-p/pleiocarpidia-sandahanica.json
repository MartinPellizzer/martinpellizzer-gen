    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia sandahanica, commonly known as the Sandahanica pleiocarpia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and clustered inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Its small, white flowers are followed by distinctive fruits that contain multiple seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
