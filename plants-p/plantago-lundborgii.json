    "intro": "Plantago lundborgii, commonly known as the Arctic plantain, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a rosette of broad, hairy leaves that help it retain heat and moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
