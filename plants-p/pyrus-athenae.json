    "intro": "Pyrus athenae, commonly known as the Athens pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Pyrus athenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in Greek horticulture."
