    "intro": "Praticola, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The flowers are yellow and produce a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. Praticola is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
