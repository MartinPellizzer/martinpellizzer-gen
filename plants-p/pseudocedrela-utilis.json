    "intro": "Pseudocedrela utilis, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
