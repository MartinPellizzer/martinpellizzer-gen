    "intro": "Panicum patens f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass species characterized by its wide, flat leaves. It is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, typically found in wetland and marshy environments. The plant produces loose, open panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, grass-like appearance. The species is well adapted to moist soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
