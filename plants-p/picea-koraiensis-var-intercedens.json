It is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. The plant exhibits characteristics typical of the Pinaceae family, including resinous sap and a secondary growth pattern."
