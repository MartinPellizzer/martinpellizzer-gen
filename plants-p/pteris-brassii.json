    "intro": "Pteris brassii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and wetlands. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. Pteris brassii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
