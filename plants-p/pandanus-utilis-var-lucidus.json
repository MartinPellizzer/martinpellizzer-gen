    "intro": "Pandanus utilis var. lucidus, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching material."
