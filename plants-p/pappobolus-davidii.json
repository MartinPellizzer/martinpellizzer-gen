    "intro": "Pappobolus davidii, commonly known as the David's pappobolus, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showing adaptations to dry environments. Its leaves are often narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal."
