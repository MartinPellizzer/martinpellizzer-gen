    "intro": "Polygonum sinarum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinct leaf structure and flowering patterns. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
