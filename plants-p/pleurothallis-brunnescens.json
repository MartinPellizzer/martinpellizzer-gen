    "intro": "Pleurothallis brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stem orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled environments."
