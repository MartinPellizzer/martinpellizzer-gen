    "intro": "Plagioceltis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
