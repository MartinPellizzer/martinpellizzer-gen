    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta var. ussuriense, commonly known as Ussuri knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish underside. The small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer."
