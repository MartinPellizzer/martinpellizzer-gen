    "intro": "Podochilus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the silver fern, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, silver-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. The botanical features of Podochilus oxyphyllus make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
