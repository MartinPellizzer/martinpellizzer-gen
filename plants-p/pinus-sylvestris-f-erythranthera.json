    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. erythranthera, commonly known as the red-flowered Scots pine, is a natural variant of the Scots pine tree. This form is characterized by its distinctive reddish-pink cones, which set it apart from the typical green cones of the standard species. The botanical feature of this form lies in its unique seed cone coloration, which is due to a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. It is primarily found in specific regions of Europe where the environmental conditions support its growth. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and genetic diversity."
