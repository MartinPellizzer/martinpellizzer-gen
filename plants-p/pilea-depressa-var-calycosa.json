    "intro": "Pilea depressa var. calycosa, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of oval, waxy leaves that form a low, mat-like growth habit. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring, followed by pale green berries. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
