    "intro": "Pyrus gemella, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Pyrus gemella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest."
