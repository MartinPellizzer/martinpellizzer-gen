    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. cubense, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-green seed heads that appear in late summer. This variety is particularly noted for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in bioenergy and ecological landscaping. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing habitat and food sources."
