    "intro": "Psilothonna gamolepis, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Psilothonna gamolepis is considered a conservation concern."
