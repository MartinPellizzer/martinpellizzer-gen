    "intro": "Pelexia saccata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often whorled and may have a bluish-green hue. Pelexia saccata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
