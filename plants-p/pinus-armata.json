    "intro": "Pinus armata, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The tree has a distinctive appearance with a twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a vital role in its native ecosystems."
