    "intro": "Phelypaea pulchra, commonly known as the pink-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a striking pinkish veining against a dark green background. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical features of Phelypaea pulchra make it a unique and visually appealing addition to aquatic gardens and conservation efforts."
