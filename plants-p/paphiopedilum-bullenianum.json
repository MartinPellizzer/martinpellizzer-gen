    "intro": "Paphiopedilum bullenianum, commonly known as the Bullen's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized structure for trapping pollinators. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with thick, fleshy roots adapted to its moist, shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
