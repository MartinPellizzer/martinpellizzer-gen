    "intro": "Plectranthus japonicus var. macraei, commonly known as the Japanese nettle or Japanese mint, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and a distinct, mint-like fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
