    "intro": "Phegopteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cliffbrake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and along stream banks, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
