    "intro": "Persea lanata, commonly known as the woolly custard apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, woolly, silver-gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, spiny fruits resembling large, green apples. The fruit contains a starchy, creamy pulp and is often used in traditional cuisines. Persea lanata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some medicinal uses in native cultures."
