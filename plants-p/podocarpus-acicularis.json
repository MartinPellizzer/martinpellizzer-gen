    "intro": "Podocarpus acicularis, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Podocarpus acicularis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
