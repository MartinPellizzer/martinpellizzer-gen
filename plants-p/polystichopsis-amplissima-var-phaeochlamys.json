    "intro": "Polystichopsis amplissima var. phaeochlamys, commonly known as the dark frond fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polystichopsis species. It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lush, dense appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The varietal name 'phaeochlamys' refers to its dark-colored, clasping frond bases, which distinguish it from other varieties."
