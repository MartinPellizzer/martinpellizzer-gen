    "intro": "Pappophorum pusillum, commonly known as the small pappus grass, is a small annual grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures for aid in dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its compact size and adaptations to arid environments."
