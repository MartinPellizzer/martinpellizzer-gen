    "intro": "Piper miniatum var. brevispicatum, commonly known as the dwarf pepper plant, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that give way to small, round berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils and have been used for their purported medicinal properties. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
