    "intro": "Pseudosarcopera, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Africa, particularly in regions of southern and eastern Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions. Pseudosarcopera species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making."
