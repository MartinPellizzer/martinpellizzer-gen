    "intro": "Panicum calvescens, commonly known as little barley, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum calvescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
