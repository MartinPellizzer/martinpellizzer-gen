    "intro": "Polycephalium capitatum, commonly known as the clustered head polypore, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered, and often sponge-like fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead wood. The basidiomycete produces spores on its porous, white to yellowish surface, which is typical of polypores. It is found in temperate regions and is often associated with decaying hardwoods. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for mycological study."
