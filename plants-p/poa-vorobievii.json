    "intro": "Poa vorobievii, commonly known as the Vorobievii bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
