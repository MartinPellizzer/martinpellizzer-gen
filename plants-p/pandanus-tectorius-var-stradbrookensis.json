The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are often used in traditional ceremonies. Its fibrous leaves are utilized in basket weaving and thatching, making it an important resource in local communities. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
