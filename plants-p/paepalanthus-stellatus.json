    "intro": "Paepalanthus stellatus, commonly known as the star-like cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a low-growing, perennial cactus that typically forms dense clusters of small, cylindrical stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Paepalanthus stellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
