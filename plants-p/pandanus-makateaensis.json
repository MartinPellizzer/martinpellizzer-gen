    "intro": "Pandanus makateaensis, commonly known as the Tuamotu pandanus, is a species of palm native to the French Polynesian island of Makatea. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and construction. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salt spray environments. Its root system is well adapted to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The fruit, though not widely consumed, plays a role in local ecosystems and may have historical uses by indigenous communities."
