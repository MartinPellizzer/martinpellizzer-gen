    "intro": "Polypodiodes atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's polypody, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
