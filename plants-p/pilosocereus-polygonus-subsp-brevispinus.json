    "intro": "Pilosocereus polygonus subsp. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, white spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to desert conditions."
