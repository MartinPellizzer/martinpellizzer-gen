    "intro": "Polygala carphoides var. radlkoferi, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Polygalaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
