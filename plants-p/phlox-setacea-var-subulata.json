    "intro": "Phlox setacea var. subulata, commonly known as the slender phlox, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, grass-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
