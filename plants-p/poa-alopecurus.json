    "intro": "Poa alopecurus, commonly known as mouse grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually pale green or brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa alopecurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
