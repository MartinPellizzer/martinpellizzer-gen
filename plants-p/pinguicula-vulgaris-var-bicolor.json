    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish, with a distinctive two-toned appearance. The species is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat."
