It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are often used as a grain crop in some parts of the world. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical structure supports its role in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
