    "intro": "Pimpinella weishanensis, commonly known as the Weishan cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to China, specifically found in the Weishan Mountains region. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring, producing small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
