    "intro": "Pterostylis \u00d7 toveyana, commonly known as the Tovey's hooded orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like labellum and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and hybrid origin."
