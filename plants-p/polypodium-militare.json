    "intro": "Polypodium militare, commonly known as the sword fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil. Polypodium militare is widely distributed across the Americas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
