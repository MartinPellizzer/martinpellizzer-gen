    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. normale, commonly known as the common poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, often with a blackened center. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also serve as a source of nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
