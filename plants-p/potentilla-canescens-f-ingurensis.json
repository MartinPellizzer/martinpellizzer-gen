    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. ingurensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a botanical variant of the common potentilla. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations across mountainous regions. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
