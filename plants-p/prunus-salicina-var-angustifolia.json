    "intro": "Prunus salicina var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates. The variety is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
