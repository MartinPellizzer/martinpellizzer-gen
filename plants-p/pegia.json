    "intro": "Pegia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Pegia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it suitable for erosion control and as a shade provider in landscapes."
