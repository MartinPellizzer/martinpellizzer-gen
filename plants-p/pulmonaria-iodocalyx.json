    "intro": "Pulmonaria iodocalyx, commonly known as the iodine-leaved lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, lobed leaves that range in color from dark green to bluish-gray. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of violet or blue. Its foliage is notable for its striking, waxy texture and coloration, which can resemble iodine-stained leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
