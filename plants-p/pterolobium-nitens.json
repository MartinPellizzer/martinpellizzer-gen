    "intro": "Pterolobium nitens, commonly known as the slender legume, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
