    "intro": "Pimelea rosea, commonly known as the pink swamp gum, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, often near freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Pimelea rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environments."
