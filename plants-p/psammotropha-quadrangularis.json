It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, quadrangular stems and small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged oppositely, which helps it conserve water in dry conditions. Psammotropha quadrangularis is commonly found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture availability."
