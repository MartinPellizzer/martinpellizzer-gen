    "intro": "Prunus hirtipes var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-sour cherries that ripen in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and for commercial use in some regions."
