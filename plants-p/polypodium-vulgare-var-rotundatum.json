It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically rounded or elliptic in shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
