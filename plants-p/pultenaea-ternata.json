    "intro": "Pultenaea ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved bush vetch, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pultenaea ternata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal blooms."
