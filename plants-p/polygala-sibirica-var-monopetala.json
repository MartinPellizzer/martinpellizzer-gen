    "intro": "Polygala sibirica var. monopetala, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are alternate and often have a slight pubescence, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. This variety is distinguished by having only a single flower per inflorescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Polygala sibirica."
