    "intro": "Psammisia micrantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psammisia micrantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
