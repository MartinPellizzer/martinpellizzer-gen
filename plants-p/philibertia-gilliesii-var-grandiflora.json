    "intro": "Philibertia gilliesii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered philibertia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
