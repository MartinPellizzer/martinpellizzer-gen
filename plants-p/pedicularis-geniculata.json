    "intro": "Pedicularis geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling those of the genus *Epipactis*. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. Its unique, zigzagging stem and specialized pollination mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
