It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that often droop downward. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by distinctive, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and humid environments."
