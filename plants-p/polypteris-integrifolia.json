    "intro": "Polypteris integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky surfaces or stream banks. The fronds are usually green and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
