    "intro": "Prunus persica var. nectarina, commonly known as the nectarine, is a variety of peach that differs from the common peach by having a smooth, fuzzy-free skin. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically sweet and juicy, with a vibrant yellow or orange hue when ripe. Nectarines are characterized by their compact growth habit and ornamental value, making them suitable for both fruit production and ornamental gardening. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves."
