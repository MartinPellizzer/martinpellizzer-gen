    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana var. leucopolitanoides, commonly known as the white-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a subtle, sweet fragrance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
