    "intro": "Peucedanum triternatum var. platycarpum, commonly known as broad-fruited cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its fruits are distinctive, broad and flat, with a ridged surface, and are enclosed in a bract. This species is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
