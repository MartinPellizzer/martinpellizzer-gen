    "intro": "Polygala jamesii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Polygala jamesii is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
