    "intro": "Puccinellia retroflexa var. virescens, commonly known as green sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
