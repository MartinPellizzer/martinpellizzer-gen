    "intro": "Phaca convallaria, commonly known as the lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in a whorled pattern. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shaded woodland areas. The plant is also notable for its toxic properties, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
