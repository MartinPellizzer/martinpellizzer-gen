    "intro": "Ptilocalais macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ptilocalais, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests or under dense canopy cover. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ptilocalais macrolepis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
