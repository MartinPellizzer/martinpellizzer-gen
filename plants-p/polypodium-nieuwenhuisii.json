    "intro": "Polypodium nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
