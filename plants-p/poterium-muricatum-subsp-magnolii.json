    "intro": "Poterium muricatum subsp. magnolii, commonly known as the magnolia lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, white to pale pink flowers that resemble those of magnolias, hence its common name. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and moths."
