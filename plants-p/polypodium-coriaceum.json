    "intro": "Polypodium coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern or rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically 1 to 2 feet long. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. Polypodium coriaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
