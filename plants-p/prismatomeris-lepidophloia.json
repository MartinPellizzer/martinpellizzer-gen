    "intro": "Prismatomeris lepidophloia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is highly valued for its rich, reddish hue and has been used historically in the production of high-quality wood. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
