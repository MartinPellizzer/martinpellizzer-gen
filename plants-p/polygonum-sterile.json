    "intro": "Polygonum sterile, commonly known as the sterile knotweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its lack of viable seeds, it is not considered a true weed but can still be invasive in certain environments."
