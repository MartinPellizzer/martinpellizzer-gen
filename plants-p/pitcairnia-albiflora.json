    "intro": "Pitcairnia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
