The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
