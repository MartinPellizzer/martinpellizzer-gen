    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. applanata, commonly known as the flatneedle pine, is a rare and specialized variant of the Spanish pine. It is characterized by its flattened, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to the typical pine needles. This variety is adapted to specific microhabitats, often found in rocky or high-altitude environments. Its cones are small and typically remain closed for a long period, which is a unique reproductive trait. The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native mountainous regions."
