    "intro": "Poinsettia pulcherrima var. albida, commonly known as the white poinsettia, is a striking variant of the traditional poinsettia. It is characterized by its pale, almost white bracts that contrast with its deep green foliage. This variety is a cultivar of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its ornamental value during the holiday season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
