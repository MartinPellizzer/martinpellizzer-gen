    "intro": "Polypodium subtetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-angled fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium subtetragonum is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions across Asia and the Pacific."
