    "intro": "Pandaca speciosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
