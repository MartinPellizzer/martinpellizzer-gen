    "intro": "Pleuropogon sabinei, commonly known as Sabine's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in conservation efforts aimed at preserving native wetland vegetation."
