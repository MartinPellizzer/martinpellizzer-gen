    "intro": "Pinus nootkatensis, commonly known as the Alaska white pine, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
