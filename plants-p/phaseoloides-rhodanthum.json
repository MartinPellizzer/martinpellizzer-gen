    "intro": "Phaseoloides rhodanthum, commonly known as the red-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to violet. The plant produces small, round pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
