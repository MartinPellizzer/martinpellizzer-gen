It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium govidjoaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
