    "intro": "Phlebodium squamulosum, commonly known as the scaly wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds covered in small, scaly structures that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture from the air. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
