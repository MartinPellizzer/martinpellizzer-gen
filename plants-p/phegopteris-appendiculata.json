    "intro": "Phegopteris appendiculata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded lobes that give it a distinctive appearance."
