    "intro": "Peristylus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid peristyle, is a member of the Malvaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it useful in soil stabilization and erosion control. Peristylus rigidus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant."
