    "intro": "Protea radula, commonly known as the rock protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown, with numerous small, tubular flowers clustered around a central stem. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and they bloom in late winter to early spring. Protea radula is not only ornamental but also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems."
