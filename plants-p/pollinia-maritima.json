    "intro": "Pollinia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, round pollen masses called pollinia, which are adapted for transfer by insects or wind. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or coastal scrub habitats. Sea holly is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
