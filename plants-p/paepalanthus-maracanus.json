    "intro": "Paepalanthus maracanus, commonly known as the Maracanu cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions, and its structure allows it to thrive in full sun. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
