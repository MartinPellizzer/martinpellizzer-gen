    "intro": "Phalaenopsis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine moth orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often white or pale pink, resembling moths, hence its common name. It has long, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
