    "intro": "Pitcairnia albifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
