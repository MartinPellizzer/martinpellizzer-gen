It is characterized by its distinctive, prism-like leaf structures that reflect light in a unique way. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its rare habitat and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
