    "intro": "Peperomia gollii, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, often growing in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia gollii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
