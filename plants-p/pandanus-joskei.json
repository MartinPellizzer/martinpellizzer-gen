    "intro": "Pandanus joskei, commonly known as the Joske's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in panicles, which later develop into fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be processed into materials used for making mats and thatch. Pandanus joskei thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
