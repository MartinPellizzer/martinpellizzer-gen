    "intro": "Panicum strumosum, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense clumps, making it a valuable component of native prairie ecosystems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant for ecological restoration projects."
