    "intro": "Passiflora mollis, commonly known as the velvet passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and striking, showy flowers that resemble the Passion of Christ. The flowers feature a central crown of filaments, surrounded by five sepals and five petals, and are often accompanied by a crown of stamens. It produces small, blue or purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
