    "intro": "Pyrus atropurpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinged foliage, which turns reddish in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Pyrus atropurpurea is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and gardens."
