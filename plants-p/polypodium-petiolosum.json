    "intro": "Polypodium petiolosum, commonly known as the veined cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded environments, where it can anchor itself using its rhizomes. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinct vein pattern that gives it its common name. Polypodium petiolosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
