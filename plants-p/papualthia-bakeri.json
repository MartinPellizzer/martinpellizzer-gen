    "intro": "Papualthia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's papua lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at high elevations, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Papualthia bakeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
