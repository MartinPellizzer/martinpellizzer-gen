    "intro": "Peltapteris peltata, commonly known as the frilled water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Peltaspermales. It is characterized by its distinctive, frilled fronds that resemble the shape of a shield, giving it its genus name. The plant thrived during the Late Devonian period, approximately 380 million years ago. Its fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating its prevalence in ancient swampy environments. The structure of its fronds suggests it may have had a complex vascular system, enabling it to grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
