    "intro": "Penstemon attenuatus var. varians, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
