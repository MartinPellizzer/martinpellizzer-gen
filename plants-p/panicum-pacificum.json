    "intro": "Panicum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
