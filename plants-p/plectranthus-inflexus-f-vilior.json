    "intro": "Plectranthus inflexus f. vilior, commonly known as the silver-leaf plectranthus, is a variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or violet, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
