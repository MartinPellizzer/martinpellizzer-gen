    "intro": "Paronychia rugelii, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments. Paronychia rugelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
