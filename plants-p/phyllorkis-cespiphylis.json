    "intro": "Phyllorkis cespiphylis, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense tufts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil. Phyllorkis cespiphylis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
