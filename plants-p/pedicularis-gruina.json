    "intro": "Pedicularis gruina, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble the fur of a monkey. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
