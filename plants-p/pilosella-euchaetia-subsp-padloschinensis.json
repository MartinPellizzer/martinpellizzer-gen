    "intro": "Pilosella euchaetia subsp. padloschinensis, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range."
