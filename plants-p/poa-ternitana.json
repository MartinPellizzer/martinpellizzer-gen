    "intro": "Poa ternitana, commonly known as the Canary Island grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Poa ternitana is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of its native region, including high levels of sunlight and limited water availability."
