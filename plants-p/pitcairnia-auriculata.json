    "intro": "Pitcairnia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking pink or red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia auriculata is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and unique appearance."
