    "intro": "Polypodium marginellum var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the wall fern genus Polypodium. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or shaded forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
