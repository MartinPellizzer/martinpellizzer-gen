    "intro": "Phoradendron tetracarpum, commonly known as the four-fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in ecological interactions within forest ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also contributes to biodiversity by supporting various wildlife species."
