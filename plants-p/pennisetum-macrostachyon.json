    "intro": "Pennisetum macrostachyon, commonly known as giant feather grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, arching panicles that produce fluffy, seed-bearing heads. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its feathery appearance adds visual interest to gardens and can be used as a backdrop in mixed plantings. Pennisetum macrostachyon is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
