    "intro": "Parastrephia phyliciformis, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure features a single, elongated white flower with intricate petal arrangements. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
