    "intro": "Peniocereus serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers at night, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching maturity over several decades."
