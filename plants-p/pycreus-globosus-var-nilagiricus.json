It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth surface and a dark green color, and it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
