    "intro": "Pilosella leptadeniiformis, commonly known as the slender-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Pilosella leptadeniiformis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
