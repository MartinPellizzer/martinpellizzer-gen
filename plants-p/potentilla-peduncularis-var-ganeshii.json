    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis var. ganeshii, commonly known as Ganesh's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
