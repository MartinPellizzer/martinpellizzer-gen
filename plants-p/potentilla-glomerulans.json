    "intro": "Potentilla glomerulans, commonly known as the clustered cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rounded, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
