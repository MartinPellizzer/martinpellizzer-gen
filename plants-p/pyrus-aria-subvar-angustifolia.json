    "intro": "Pyrus aria subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a botanical variant of the pear species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This subvariety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit-bearing potential in suitable environments."
