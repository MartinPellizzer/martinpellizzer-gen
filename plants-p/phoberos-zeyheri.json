    "intro": "Phoberos zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the Western Cape of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phoberos zeyheri is classified as critically endangered."
