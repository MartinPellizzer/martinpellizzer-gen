    "intro": "Pleonotoma tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-ridged pleonotoma, is a species of aquatic snail belonging to the family Lymnaeidae. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell with four distinct ridges, which provide structural support and aid in camouflage. The shell is typically smooth and has a light to dark brown coloration, depending on the habitat. This species is found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, contributing to the ecological balance of its aquatic habitat."
