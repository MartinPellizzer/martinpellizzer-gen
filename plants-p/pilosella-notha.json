    "intro": "Pilosella notha, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming a cluster at the top of the stem. Pilosella notha is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators."
