    "intro": "Pleopeltis leiopteris, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
