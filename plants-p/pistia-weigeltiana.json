    "intro": "Pistia weigeltiana, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize it in water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Pistia weigeltiana is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments."
