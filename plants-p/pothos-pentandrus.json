    "intro": "Pothos pentandrus, commonly known as the five-finger plant, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically variegated with light green and white patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. Pothos pentandrus is well-suited for hanging baskets or shelves, where its cascading growth habit can be appreciated."
