    "intro": "Prescottia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's Prescottia, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, specifically the Sierra Madre Occidental. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia smithii is considered a conservation concern."
