    "intro": "Poecilostachys geminata, commonly known as the twin-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three flowers per spikelet. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Poecilostachys geminata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
