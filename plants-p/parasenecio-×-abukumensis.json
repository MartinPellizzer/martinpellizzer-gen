    "intro": "Parasenecio \u00d7 abukumensis, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
