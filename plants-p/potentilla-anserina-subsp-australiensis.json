    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subsp. australiensis, commonly known as the Australian silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for use in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry climates."
