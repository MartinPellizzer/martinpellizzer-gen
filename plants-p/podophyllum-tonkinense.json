It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately divided leaves that resemble the claws of a tiger. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas.
