    "intro": "Potentilla chrysocraspeda var. minor, commonly known as the lesser golden-haircup, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
