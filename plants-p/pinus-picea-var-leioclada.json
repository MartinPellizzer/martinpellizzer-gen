    "intro": "Pinus picea var. leioclada, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark blue-gray needles that are shorter than those of the typical white spruce. The cones are slender and often hang downward, with scales that are sharply pointed. This variety thrives in cold climates and is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types, including poor and rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
