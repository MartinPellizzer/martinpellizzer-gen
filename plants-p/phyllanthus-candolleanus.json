It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to orange-red when mature. The fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been used in traditional medicine for its antioxidant properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a warm, humid climate."
