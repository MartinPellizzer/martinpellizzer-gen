    "intro": "Paspalum nutans, commonly known as the drooping grass or weeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its drooping, hair-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, pale flowers in clusters. Paspalum nutans is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
