    "intro": "Platypus papillifer, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. The flowers are usually pink or purple and are adapted for insect pollination."
