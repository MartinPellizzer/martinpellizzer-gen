    "intro": "Pfeiffera ianthothele, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
