    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five, giving it the species name *pentaphylla*. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
