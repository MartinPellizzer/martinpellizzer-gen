    "intro": "Primula capillaris, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms from late winter to early summer, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Primula capillaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments."
