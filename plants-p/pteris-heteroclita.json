    "intro": "Pteris heteroclita, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, contributing to its reproductive success. The leaves are usually light green to bronze in color, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
