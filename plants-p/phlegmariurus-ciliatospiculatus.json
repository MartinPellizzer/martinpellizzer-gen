    "intro": "Phlegmariurus ciliatospiculatus, commonly known as the hairy beard lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its dark, wrinkled thallus with a distinctive, hairy appearance on the upper surface. The lichen typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are embedded in the thallus and are released through the production of ascocarps. This species is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
