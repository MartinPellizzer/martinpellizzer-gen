It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure allows it to thrive in harsh desert environments with minimal water. Botanically, it is noted for its adaptability and resilience, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
