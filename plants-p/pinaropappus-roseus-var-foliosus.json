    "intro": "Pinaropappus roseus var. foliosus, commonly known as the leafy rose-gum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and may have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
