    "intro": "Phoradendron hexastichum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a source of food for various birds and animals. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife."
