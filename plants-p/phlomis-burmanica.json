It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping."
