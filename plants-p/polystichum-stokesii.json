    "intro": "Polystichum stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
