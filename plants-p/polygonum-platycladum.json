    "intro": "Polygonum platycladum, commonly known as the broad-leaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy species that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Polygonum platycladum is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization."
