    "intro": "Picris scabra, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and its flowers are bright yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed but has been used historically in traditional medicine."
