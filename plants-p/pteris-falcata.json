    "intro": "Pteris falcata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, arching fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Pteris falcata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
