    "intro": "Pelargonium columbinum, commonly known as the yellow geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
