    "intro": "Polygala appressa subsp. cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbrian milkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the UK. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches a height of around 30 cm. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, characteristic of the Polygala genus. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
