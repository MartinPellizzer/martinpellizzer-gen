It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are rich in antioxidants and historically used in traditional medicine. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are typically harvested in late summer and can be used to make jams, wines, and other culinary products."
