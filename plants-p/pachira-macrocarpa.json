    "intro": "Pachira macrocarpa, commonly known as the money plant or Brazilian money tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It features a thick, woody trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its unique appearance and easy care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
