    "intro": "Pilosella callimorpha, commonly known as the hairy leaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and oval, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella callimorpha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
