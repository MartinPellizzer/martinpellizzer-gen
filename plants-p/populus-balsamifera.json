    "intro": "Populus balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The tree is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems."
