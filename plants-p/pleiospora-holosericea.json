It is characterized by its dense, velvety spore masses that give it a distinct appearance. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its wide distribution. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role within mycological studies and its potential ecological impact."
