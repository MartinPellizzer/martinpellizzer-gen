    "intro": "Populus pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The Pannonian poplar is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
