It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of climates, making it a popular choice for cultivation. The plant typically produces large, juicy fruits with a sweet and sometimes aromatic flavor. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are white and fragrant. This hybrid is valued not only for its fruit quality but also for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
