    "intro": "Phlebochilus incrassatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and water quality monitoring."
