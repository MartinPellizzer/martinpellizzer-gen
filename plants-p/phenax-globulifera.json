    "intro": "Phenax globulifera, commonly known as the globe-fruit plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, round fruits that resemble miniature globes. The plant's leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
