    "intro": "Prunus microcarpa var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant produces delicate pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and as a specimen plant."
