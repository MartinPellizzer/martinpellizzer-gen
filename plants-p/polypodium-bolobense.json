    "intro": "Polypodium bolobense, commonly known as the Bolobo water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the leaves. Polypodium bolobense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
