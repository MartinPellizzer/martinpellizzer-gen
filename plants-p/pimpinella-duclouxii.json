    "intro": "Pimpinella duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small white or greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pimpinella duclouxii is considered a rare and endemic species."
