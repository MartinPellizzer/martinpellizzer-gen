    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern silverweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10-30 cm. The plant features silvery-hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variant is closely related to the more widely known Potentilla anserina, but it has distinct characteristics that set it apart in its native habitat."
