    "intro": "Plocama dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed willow. It is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. The plant has slender, woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. Plocama dubia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
