    "intro": "Paspalum sesquiglume, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for landscaping in dry regions. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental and turfgrass species."
