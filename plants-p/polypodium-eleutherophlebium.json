    "intro": "Polypodium eleutherophlebium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and prefers shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium eleutherophlebium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
