    "intro": "Physurus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-eared cactus, is a small, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features a compact stem with short, cylindrical branches that are covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
