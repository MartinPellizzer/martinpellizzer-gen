    "intro": "Polypodium anomalum, commonly known as the unusual polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a light green color and a slightly serrated margin. Polypodium anomalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
