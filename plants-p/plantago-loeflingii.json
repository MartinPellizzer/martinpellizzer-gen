It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy plant of the desert ecosystem."
