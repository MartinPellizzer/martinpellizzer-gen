    "intro": "Pseudopavonia tenax, commonly known as the hardy bushveld legume, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Pseudopavonia tenax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
