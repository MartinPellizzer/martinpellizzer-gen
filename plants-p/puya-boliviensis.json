    "intro": "Puya boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red or orange flowers, which bloom simultaneously in a dramatic display. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
