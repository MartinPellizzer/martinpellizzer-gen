    "intro": "Pitcairnia pungens var. flava, commonly known as the yellow pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that surround its inflorescence, which is typically a tall, spiky structure. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
