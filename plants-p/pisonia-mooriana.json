    "intro": "Pisonia mooriana, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its showy, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
