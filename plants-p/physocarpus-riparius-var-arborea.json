    "intro": "Physocarpus riparius var. arborea, commonly known as fragrant ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rugged, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals layers of cinnamon-colored inner bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by ornamental, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and they turn red or orange in the fall. This variety is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes."
