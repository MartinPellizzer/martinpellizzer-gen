    "intro": "Pentanema prasinurum, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Argentina. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
