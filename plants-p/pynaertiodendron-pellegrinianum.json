It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
