    "intro": "Panicum laevifolium, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or silver flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
