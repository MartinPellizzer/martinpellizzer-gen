    "intro": "Physalis foetens, commonly known as the stinkapple or winter cherry, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces distinctive yellow-orange berries enclosed in a papery calyx, which turns red as the fruit ripens. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bell-shaped and usually pink or white, blooming in late spring. The fruit is edible when fully ripe but contains toxic seeds that should be avoided."
