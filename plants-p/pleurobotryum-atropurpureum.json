It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems that display a distinctive purple hue, especially when mature. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans."
