    "intro": "Pternopetalum arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued in traditional carpentry and furniture making. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
