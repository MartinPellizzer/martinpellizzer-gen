    "intro": "Piper arboreum f. geniculatum, commonly known as the creeping pepper plant, is a unique variant of the genus Piper native to Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a glossy surface and a mildly peppery aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into narrow, elongated fruits. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions, it is often cultivated as a ground cover in tropical gardens."
