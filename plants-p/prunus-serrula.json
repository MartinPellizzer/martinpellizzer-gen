    "intro": "Prunus serrula, commonly known as the Chinese dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy white or pink bracts that appear in early spring, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Prunus serrula is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
