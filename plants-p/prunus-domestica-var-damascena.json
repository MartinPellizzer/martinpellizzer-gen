    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. damascena, commonly known as the Damask plum, is a cultivar of the European plum. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark purple fruits that are typically smaller than standard plums. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, which are often more showy than those of other plum varieties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which has a rich, sweet flavor."
