    "intro": "Peperomia galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It features succulent, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to the arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a distinctive species within the Peperomia genus."
