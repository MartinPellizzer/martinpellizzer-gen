    "intro": "Paspalidium tabulatum, commonly known as the flatleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist environments and its tolerance to periodic waterlogging. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stabilizing effect on wetland soils."
