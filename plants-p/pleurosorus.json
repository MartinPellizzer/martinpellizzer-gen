    "intro": "Pleurosorus, commonly known as the rockcap or false polypore, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Trametes. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood, particularly in forested areas, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. They are characterized by their tough, leathery caps and often have a distinctive coloration that ranges from brown to grayish-white. Pleurosorus species are usually saprophytic, meaning they derive nutrients from dead plant material rather than living hosts. Their ecological importance lies in their contribution to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
