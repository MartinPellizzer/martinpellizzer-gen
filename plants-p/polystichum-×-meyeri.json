    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum. It is a hardy, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant features robust, arching fronds with a dark green color and a serrated edge. Its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Polystichum \u00d7 meyeri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded landscapes."
