    "intro": "Platanthera lacei, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Platanthera lacei thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi."
