    "intro": "Pneumonanthe clausa, commonly known as the closed lung plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is known for its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pneumonanthe clausa is considered an endangered species."
