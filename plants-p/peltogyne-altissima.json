    "intro": "Peltogyne altissima, commonly known as the African teak, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas."
