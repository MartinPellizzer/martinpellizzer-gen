It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
