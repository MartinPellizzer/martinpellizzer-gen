It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psoralea astragalifolia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
