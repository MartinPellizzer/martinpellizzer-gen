    "intro": "Phlomis macrophylla, commonly known as large-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish to orange-red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in gardens and natural landscapes."
