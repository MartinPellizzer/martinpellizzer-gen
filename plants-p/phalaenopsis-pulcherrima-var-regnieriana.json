    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pulcherrima var. regnieriana, commonly known as the Regnier's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new pseudobulbs and leaves from the base. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This variety is prized for its longevity and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom repeatedly."
