    "intro": "Polygonum dielsii, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive nodes and arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
