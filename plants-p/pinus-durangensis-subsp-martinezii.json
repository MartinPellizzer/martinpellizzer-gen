    "intro": "Pinus durangensis subsp. martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's Durango pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The tree grows in high-altitude forests, often in association with other conifers such as Pinus hartwegii. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by fire or other disturbances, ensuring seed dispersal under favorable conditions. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
