    "intro": "Panicum teretifolium, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open fields, prairies, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
