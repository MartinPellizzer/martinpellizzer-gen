    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. cordatotrigona, commonly known as the heart-shaped cow parsley, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the cow parsley species. It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often arranged in a triangular pattern, giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
