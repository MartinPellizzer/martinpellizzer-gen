    "intro": "Paullinia multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia multiflora thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
