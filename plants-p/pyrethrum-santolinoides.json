    "intro": "Pyrethrum santolinoides, commonly known as the santolin or wild pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its stems and leaves, which are the primary source of its natural insecticidal properties. These trichomes contain pyrethrins, which are potent compounds used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum santolinoides thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
