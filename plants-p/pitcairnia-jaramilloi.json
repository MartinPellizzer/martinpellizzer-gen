    "intro": "Pitcairnia jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
