It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features fronds that are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
