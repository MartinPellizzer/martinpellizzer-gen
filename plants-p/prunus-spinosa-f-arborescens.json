    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. arborescens, commonly known as the tree form of blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn that exhibits a more shrub-like or tree-like growth habit. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, black berries that are rich in antioxidants and are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for wildlife, particularly for birds that feed on its berries."
