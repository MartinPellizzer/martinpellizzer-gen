    "intro": "Polypodium pulcherrimum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
