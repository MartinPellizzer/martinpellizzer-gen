    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. commune, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, arching appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
