It features glossy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
