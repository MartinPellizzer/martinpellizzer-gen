    "intro": "Physinga physodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Physinga physodes thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to produce a large number of seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
