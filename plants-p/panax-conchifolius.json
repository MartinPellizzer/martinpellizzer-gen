    "intro": "Panax conchifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, wavy-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing the seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their purported health benefits. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
