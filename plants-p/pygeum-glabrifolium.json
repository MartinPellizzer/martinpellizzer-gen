It is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are glabrous on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
