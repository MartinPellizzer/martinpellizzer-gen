    "intro": "Prasophyllum beatrix, commonly known as the Beatrix leek orchid, is an endemic species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. The flower spike bears several pale green to white, fragrant flowers, which are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it a characteristic of swampy habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
