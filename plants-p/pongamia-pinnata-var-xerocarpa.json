    "intro": "Pongamia pinnata var. xerocarpa, commonly known as the Indian beech or pongam tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod fruits. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. It has deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its potential use in reforestation and soil improvement projects."
