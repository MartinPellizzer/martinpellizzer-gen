    "intro": "Paranotis mitrasacmoides subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds with dark green veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of moss-like structures, which help in moisture retention. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
