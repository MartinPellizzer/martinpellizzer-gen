It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
