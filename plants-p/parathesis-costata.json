    "intro": "Parathesis costata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. It is often found in estuaries and along the shores of coastal regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
