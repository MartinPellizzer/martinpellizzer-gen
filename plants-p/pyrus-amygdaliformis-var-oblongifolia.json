    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf pear, is a variant of the pear tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling small pears. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is cultivated in gardens and orchards for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
