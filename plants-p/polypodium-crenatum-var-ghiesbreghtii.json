    "intro": "Polypodium crenatum var. ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's shield fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the shield fern genus. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
