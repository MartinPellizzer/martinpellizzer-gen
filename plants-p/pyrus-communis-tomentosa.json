    "intro": "Pyrus communis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a cultivar of the common apple tree. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) coating on both the leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible apples in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The tomentose covering also helps to protect the plant from excessive moisture loss and pests."
