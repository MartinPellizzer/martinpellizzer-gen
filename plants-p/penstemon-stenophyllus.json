    "intro": "Penstemon stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon stenophyllus is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
