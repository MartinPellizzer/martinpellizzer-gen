    "intro": "Puya serranoensis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant thrives in cool, sunny environments at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Puya serranoensis is a monocarpic plant, meaning it flowers once and then dies, making it a rare and ephemeral botanical wonder."
