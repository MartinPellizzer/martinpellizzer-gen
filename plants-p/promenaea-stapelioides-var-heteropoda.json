It features thick, fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. It produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. This plant is popular as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant due to its resilience and unique aesthetic."
