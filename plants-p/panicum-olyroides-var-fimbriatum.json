    "intro": "Panicum olyroides var. fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves with a distinctive fringed appearance along the edges. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to silver-gray seed heads that are visually striking and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects."
