    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. anzalonei, commonly known as the Anzalone's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to maintain its carnivorous traits. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
