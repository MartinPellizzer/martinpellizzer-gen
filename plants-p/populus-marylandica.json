    "intro": "Populus marylandica, commonly known as the Maryland poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. The bark of the Maryland poplar is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
