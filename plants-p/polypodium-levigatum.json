    "intro": "Polypodium levigatum, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizome is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
