    "intro": "Pouzolzia viminea var. montana, commonly known as the mountain pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
