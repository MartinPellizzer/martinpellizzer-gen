It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream patterns. The plant has aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
