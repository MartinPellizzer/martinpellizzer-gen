    "intro": "Pyrus tapashana, commonly known as the Kashmir pear, is a species of tree native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to pears in texture but have a distinct, sweet aroma. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with shallow fissures. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its fruit in local horticulture."
