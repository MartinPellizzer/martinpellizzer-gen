    "intro": "Phymatopteris nakaikeana, commonly known as the Nakai's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of root hairs. The leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
