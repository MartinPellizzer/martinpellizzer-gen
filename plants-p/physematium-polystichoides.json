It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are evergreen, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
