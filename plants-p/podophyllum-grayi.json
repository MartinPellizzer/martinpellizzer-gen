    "intro": "Podophyllum grayi, commonly known as the gray pachysandra, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Podophyllum grayi is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
