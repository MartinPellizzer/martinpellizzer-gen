    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. albiflora, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves with ciliate margins and produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect life. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lacks the stinging hairs found in true nettles."
