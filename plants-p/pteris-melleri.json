    "intro": "Pteris melleri, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris melleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
