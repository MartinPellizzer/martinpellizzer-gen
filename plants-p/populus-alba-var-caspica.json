It is characterized by its white, fuzzy bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This species typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The Caspian white poplar is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
