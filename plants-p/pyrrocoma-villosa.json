    "intro": "Pyrrocoma villosa, commonly known as the hairy pygmy bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Pyrrocoma villosa is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
