    "intro": "Pinus balfouriana subsp. austrina, commonly known as the southern whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and cone-like structures. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, arranged in bundles of five. It produces serotinous cones that open only after a fire, aiding in seed dispersal in disturbed environments. This subspecies plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
