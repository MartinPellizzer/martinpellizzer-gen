    "intro": "Polygala regnellii, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a legume that splits open to release seeds. Polygala regnellii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
