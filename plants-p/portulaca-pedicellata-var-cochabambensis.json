    "intro": "Portulaca pedicellata var. cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping and garden settings."
