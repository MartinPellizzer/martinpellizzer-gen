    "intro": "Phaca suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf's phaca, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a distinctive silvery or grayish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
