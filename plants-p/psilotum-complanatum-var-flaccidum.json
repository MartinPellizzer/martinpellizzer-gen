    "intro": "Psilotum complanatum var. flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure with small, leaf-like structures called sporophylls. The plant lacks true leaves, roots, and vascular bundles, making it one of the most primitive living ferns. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations."
