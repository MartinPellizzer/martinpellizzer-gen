    "intro": "Polystichum fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely textured appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
