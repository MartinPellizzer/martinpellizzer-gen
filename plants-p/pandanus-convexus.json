It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, bottle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making ropes and mats. The pandanus is well adapted to coastal environments and can thrive in sandy soils with high salinity."
