    "intro": "Phyllanthus beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are followed by green, fleshy capsules that mature into red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
