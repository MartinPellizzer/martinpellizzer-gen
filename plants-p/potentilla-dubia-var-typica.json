    "intro": "Potentilla dubia var. typica, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright stems and small, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
