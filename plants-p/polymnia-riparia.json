    "intro": "Polymnia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank polymnia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and other water bodies. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Polymnia riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
