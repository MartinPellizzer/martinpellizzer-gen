    "intro": "Potentilla leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, white, fleshy fruits that are distinctive and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Potentilla leucocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
