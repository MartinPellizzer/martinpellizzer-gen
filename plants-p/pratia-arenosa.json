    "intro": "Pratia arenosa, commonly known as sand pratia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. This plant is often used in dryland landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
