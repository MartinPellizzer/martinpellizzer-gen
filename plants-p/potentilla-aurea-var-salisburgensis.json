    "intro": "Potentilla aurea var. salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg goldcup, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Alps. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to mountainous landscapes. The plant has upright, branched stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow, ovate, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
