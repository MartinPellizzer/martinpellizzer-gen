    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. aquitana, commonly known as the Spanish fir or French pine, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are usually smaller and more compact, with scales that are often reddish in color. This variety is native to the Pyrenees and parts of southern France, where it thrives in mountainous and coastal regions. It is a hardy evergreen that plays an important role in the ecological and ornamental landscapes of its native habitat."
