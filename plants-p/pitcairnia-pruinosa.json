    "intro": "Pitcairnia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps collect and retain moisture. Pitcairnia pruinosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
