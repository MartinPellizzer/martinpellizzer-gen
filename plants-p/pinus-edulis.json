    "intro": "Pinus edulis, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of two, and its thick, scaly bark that provides protection against forest fires. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. This species plays a vital role in the ecosystems of its native range, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
