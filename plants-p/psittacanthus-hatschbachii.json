It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called soruses, which are clustered around the fronds. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
