    "intro": "Pinus sudeticus, commonly known as the Sudetic pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain on the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its slow growth and historical rarity, it is considered a valuable species in ecological and conservation contexts."
