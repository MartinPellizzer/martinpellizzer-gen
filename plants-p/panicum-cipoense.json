    "intro": "Panicum cipoense, commonly known as Cipo grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Paniceae tribe. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizer in erosion-prone areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
