    "intro": "Potentilla crocea var. depressa, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
