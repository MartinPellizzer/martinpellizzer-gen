    "intro": "Phymatopteris pakkaensis, commonly known as the Pakkan Island shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a dense, velvety underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
