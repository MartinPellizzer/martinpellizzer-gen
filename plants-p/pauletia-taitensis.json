    "intro": "Pauletia taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti pauletia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Taiti in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in the hot, dry conditions. Pauletia taitensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
