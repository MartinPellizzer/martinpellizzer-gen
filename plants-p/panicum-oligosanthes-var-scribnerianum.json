    "intro": "Panicum oligosanthes var. scribnerianum, commonly known as Scribner's beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant typically thrives in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
