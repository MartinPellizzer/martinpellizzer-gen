    "intro": "Polypodium integrum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect, and branched fronds that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland habitats."
