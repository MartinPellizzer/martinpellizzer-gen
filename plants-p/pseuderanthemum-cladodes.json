    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum cladodes, commonly known as the false spider flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique structure where the leaves are modified into flattened, fleshy structures called cladodes, which perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its foliage is often mistaken for leaves, but the cladodes are actually specialized stems. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
