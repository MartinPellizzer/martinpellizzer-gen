    "intro": "Pterophylla lucida, commonly known as the shining leaf plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to South Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, reflective coating, giving it its common name. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like heads, typical of the carrot family. Pterophylla lucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and pleasant scent."
