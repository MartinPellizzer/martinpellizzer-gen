    "intro": "Polypodium dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, often glossy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium dianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
