    "intro": "Pavetta diversipunctata, commonly known as the spotted pavetta, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often with opposite, simple, and ovate or elliptic leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
