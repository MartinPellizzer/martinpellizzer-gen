It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with dark veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Pleurothallis atrohiata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
