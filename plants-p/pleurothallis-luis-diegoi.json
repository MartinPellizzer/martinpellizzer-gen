It is a small epiphytic orchid with intricate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
