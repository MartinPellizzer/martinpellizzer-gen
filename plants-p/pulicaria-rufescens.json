    "intro": "Pulicaria rufescens, commonly known as the rough pulicaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in rocky, dry, and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture and helping to reduce water loss. Pulicaria rufescens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
