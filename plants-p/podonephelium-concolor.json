    "intro": "Podonephelium concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridophyte, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, clustered fronds. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
