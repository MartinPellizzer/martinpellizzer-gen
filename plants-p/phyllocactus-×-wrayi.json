    "intro": "Phyllocactus \u00d7 wrayi, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a unique hybrid species resulting from the cross between Phyllocactus hirtellus and Phyllocactus subulatus. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
