    "intro": "Potentilla stenotoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, five-lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a compact growth habit. Potentilla stenotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
