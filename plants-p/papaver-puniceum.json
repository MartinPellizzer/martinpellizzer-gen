    "intro": "Papaver puniceum, commonly known as the red poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are dark green and hairy, and it produces a tall, slender stem with showy, cup-shaped flowers. Papaver puniceum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are small and oval, and they are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread across open areas."
