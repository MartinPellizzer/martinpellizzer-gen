    "intro": "Platystele cornejoi, commonly known as the Colombian small-leafed marsh orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the humid cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and short, erect stems. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Platystele cornejoi thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
