    "intro": "Poa helenae, commonly known as Helen's bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
