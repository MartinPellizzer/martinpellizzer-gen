    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 osceola, commonly known as the Florida panther orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamp forests, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
