    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. tenuis, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
