It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. While it is not psychoactive, it shares some morphological traits with other members of the Apiaceae family that do possess hallucinogenic properties."
