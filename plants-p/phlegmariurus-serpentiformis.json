    "intro": "Phlegmariurus serpentiformis, commonly known as the serpent moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive, ribbon-like appearance with a flattened, elongated structure that resembles a snake, hence its common name. Its leafy structures are closely arranged, forming a dense, carpet-like growth on the forest floor. Phlegmariurus serpentiformis plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
