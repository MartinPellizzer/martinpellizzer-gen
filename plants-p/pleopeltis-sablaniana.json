    "intro": "Pleopeltis sablaniana, commonly known as the Sablan rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are borne on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
