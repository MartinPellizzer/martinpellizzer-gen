    "intro": "Perymeniopsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly outlines, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Perymeniopsis is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
