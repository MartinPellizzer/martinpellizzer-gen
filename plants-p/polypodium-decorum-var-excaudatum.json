    "intro": "Polypodium decorum var. excaudatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a unique tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are short and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
