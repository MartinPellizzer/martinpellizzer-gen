    "intro": "Pinus deodara var. robusta, commonly known as the Himalayan blue pine, is a variant of the deodar pine native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking blue-gray in winter. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a conical shape and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its needles are typically longer than those of the standard deodar pine, and it produces cones that are often used in horticulture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and as a windbreak in colder climates."
