    "intro": "Pentaloba semigyrata, commonly known as the spiral-leaf pentaloba, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
