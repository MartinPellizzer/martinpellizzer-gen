    "intro": "Puccinellia angustata var. vaginata, commonly known as narrowleaf glassworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed soils, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salinity and drought. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
