    "intro": "Polygala violacea var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, while the flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure. This variant is distinguished from the typical Polygala violacea by its shorter floral stems and compact inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
