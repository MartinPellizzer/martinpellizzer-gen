    "intro": "Pulmonaria murinii, commonly known as mouse ear pulmonaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosettes of hairy, kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Pulmonaria murinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
