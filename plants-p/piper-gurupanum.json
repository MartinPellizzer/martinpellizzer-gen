    "intro": "Piper gurupanum, commonly known as the Amazonian pepper or Gurupi pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, elongated berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries contain a high concentration of alkaloids, particularly piperine, which contributes to its pungent flavor. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in local cuisines."
