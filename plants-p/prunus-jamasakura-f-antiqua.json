    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. antiqua, commonly known as the old-fashioned Japanese cherry, is a rare and ancient cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a pale pink to white hue. The plant is native to Japan and is closely related to the more common Prunus jamasakura, but it exhibits distinct morphological features. It typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, with twisted branches and a unique, irregular form. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable specimen in botanical collections."
