    "intro": "Platycoryne montis-elgon, commonly known as the Elgon wax tree, is a shrub native to the highlands of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It is characterized by its dense, waxy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
