    "intro": "Paspalum eucanum, commonly known as the coast paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it withstand salt spray and wind. Paspalum eucanum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
