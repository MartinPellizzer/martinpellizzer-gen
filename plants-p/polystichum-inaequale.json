    "intro": "Polystichum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal sword fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate leaves. Polystichum inaequale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
