    "intro": "Primula exscapa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, broad, and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Primula exscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
