    "intro": "Primula diapensiifolia, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, adding visual interest even when not in bloom."
