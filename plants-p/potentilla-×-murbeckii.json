    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
