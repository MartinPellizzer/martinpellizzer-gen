    "intro": "Perezia laevis, commonly known as the smooth perezia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
