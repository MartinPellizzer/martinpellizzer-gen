    "intro": "Pleurocarpaea, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often colorful flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. They are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Pleurocarpaea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their botanical features include fleshy roots, strap-like leaves, and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators."
