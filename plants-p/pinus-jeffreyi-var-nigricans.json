    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyi var. nigricans, commonly known as the black Jeffrey pine, is a variant of the Jeffrey pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, often blackish bark, which gives it its common name. The tree has long, needle-like leaves that are typically grouped in fives, and it produces cones that are often retained on the branches for several years. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
