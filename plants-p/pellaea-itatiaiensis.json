It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea itatiaiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
