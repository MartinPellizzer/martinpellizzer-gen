    "intro": "Polypodium hastatum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, lance-shaped appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
