    "intro": "Pterocaulon glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly pterocaulon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in drought conditions."
