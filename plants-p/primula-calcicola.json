    "intro": "Primula calcicola, commonly known as the limestone primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and calcareous habitats in Europe. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
