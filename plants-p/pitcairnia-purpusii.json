    "intro": "Pitcairnia purpusii, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in late summer and are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Pitcairnia purpusii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
