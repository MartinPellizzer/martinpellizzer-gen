It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
