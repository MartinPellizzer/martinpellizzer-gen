    "intro": "Panicum koolauense, commonly known as Koolau grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native range."
