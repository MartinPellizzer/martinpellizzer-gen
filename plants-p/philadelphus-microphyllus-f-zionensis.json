    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus f. zionensis, commonly known as the Zionensis Mockorange, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Philadelphus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blossoms and compact growth habit."
