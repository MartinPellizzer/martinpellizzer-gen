    "intro": "Pentameria, commonly known as the five-parted plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its pentamerous flowers, meaning they have five parts in each whorl, such as sepals, petals, and stamens. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the plant often has hairy stems and foliage. Pentameria species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
