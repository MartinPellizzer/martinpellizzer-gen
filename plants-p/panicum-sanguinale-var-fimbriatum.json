It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive reddish tinge along the midrib, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish plumes that add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical structure makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
