    "intro": "Pyrus ulleungensis, commonly known as the Ulleung Island pear, is a rare species native to Ulleungdo, an island in the Sea of Japan. It is a deciduous tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its broad leaves and small, edible fruits. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
