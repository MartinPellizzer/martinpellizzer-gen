It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
