    "intro": "Plantago atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic plantain, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is well adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant has erect, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. This hardy species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
