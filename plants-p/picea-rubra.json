    "intro": "Picea rubra, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Picea rubra thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
