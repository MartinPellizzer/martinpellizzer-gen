    "intro": "Phleum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in forested areas. Phleum sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
