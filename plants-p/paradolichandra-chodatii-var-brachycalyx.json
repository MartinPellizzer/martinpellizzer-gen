    "intro": "Paradolichandra chodatii var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx paradolichandra, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and the flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
