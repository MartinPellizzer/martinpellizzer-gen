    "intro": "Poa stellaris, commonly known as star grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that often appear star-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Poa stellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
