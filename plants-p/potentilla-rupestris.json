    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky slopes or in dry meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
