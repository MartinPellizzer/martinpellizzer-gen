    "intro": "Prunus microcarpa var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted cherry or twisted Prunus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted branches that give it a distinctive and often ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, and they turn reddish in the fall. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
