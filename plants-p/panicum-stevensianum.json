    "intro": "Panicum stevensianum, commonly known as the Stevens' panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Panicum stevensianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, sandy environments."
