    "intro": "Polystichum triangulum subsp. mucronatum, commonly known as the blunt-tipped wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a triangular shape. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
