    "intro": "Psidium obversum, commonly known as the wax apple or Surinam cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, followed by the development of the characteristic fleshy, aromatic fruits."
