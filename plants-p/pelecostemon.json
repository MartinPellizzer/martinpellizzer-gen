    "intro": "Pelecostemon, commonly known as the sticky seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that typically have two lips. The flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its propagation. Pelecostemon species are native to regions of Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats."
