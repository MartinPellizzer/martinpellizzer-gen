    "intro": "Plectronia subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-headed plectronia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. Plectronia subcapitata plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying native flora."
