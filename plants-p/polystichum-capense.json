    "intro": "Polystichum capense, commonly known as the Cape shield fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to South Africa. It features a dense, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact, shield-like structures. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Polystichum capense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
