    "intro": "Papaver nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the seeds used as a spice. The fruit's outer layer, known as the pericarp, is the source of the aromatic compound piperine. This plant is cultivated for its pungent seeds, which are widely used in global cuisine and traditional medicine."
