    "intro": "Phymatopteris simplicissima, commonly known as the simple maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and have a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
