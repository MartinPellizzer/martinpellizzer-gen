    "intro": "Physosiphon, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. These structures, called bladders, are specialized organs that aid in the plant's carnivorous lifestyle. Physosiphon species typically grow in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant's morphology includes slender stems and leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water."
