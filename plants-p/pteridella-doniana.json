    "intro": "Pteridella doniana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help in stabilizing the ecosystem. Pteridella doniana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
