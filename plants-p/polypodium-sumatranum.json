    "intro": "Polypodium sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, glossy appearance."
