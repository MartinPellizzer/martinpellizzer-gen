    "intro": "Pandanus unguiculatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves that are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to coastal environments, allowing it to thrive in salty, sandy soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and has cultural significance in various Pacific Island communities."
