    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. veitchiana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its beauty and seasonal flowering make it a symbol of renewal and the changing seasons in Japanese culture."
