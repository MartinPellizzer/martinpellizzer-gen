    "intro": "Polystichum parvipinnulum, commonly known as the small-pinnate wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, dark green fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Polystichum parvipinnulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
