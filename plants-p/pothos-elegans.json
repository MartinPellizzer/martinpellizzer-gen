    "intro": "Pothos elegans, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a vigorous evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that often have a golden-yellow margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly adaptable to various soil types. Pothos elegans is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to climb or trail from hanging baskets."
