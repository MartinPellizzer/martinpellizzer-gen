    "intro": "Primula caldaria, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Primula caldaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
