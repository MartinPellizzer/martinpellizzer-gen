It is native to various regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a scent reminiscent of jasmine. Phaedra species are typically shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. Due to its medicinal properties, some species of Phaedra have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic effects."
