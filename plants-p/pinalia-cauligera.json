    "intro": "Pinalia cauligera, commonly known as the clouded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that often have a pale greenish or white color with faintly veined petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia cauligera is considered a species of conservation concern."
