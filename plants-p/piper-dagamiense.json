    "intro": "Piper dagamiense, commonly known as the Dagami pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, three-lobed berries that are typically used in traditional medicine and local cuisine."
