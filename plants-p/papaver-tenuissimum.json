    "intro": "Papaver tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The slender poppy is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
