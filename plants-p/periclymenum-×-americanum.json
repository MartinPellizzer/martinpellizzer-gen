It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Periclymenum quintatum and Periclymenum montanum. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
