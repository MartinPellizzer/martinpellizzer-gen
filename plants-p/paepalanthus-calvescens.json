    "intro": "Paepalanthus calvescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The velvetleaf cactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
