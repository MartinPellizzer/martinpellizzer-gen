    "intro": "Platyaechmea tillandsioides var. kienastii, commonly known as the Kienast's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
