    "intro": "Pyrus arranensis, commonly known as the Arran pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the Isle of Arran in Scotland. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible pears that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
