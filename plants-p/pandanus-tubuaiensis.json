    "intro": "Pandanus tubuaiensis, commonly known as the Tubuai pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific, particularly found in the Tubuai Islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, fan-like crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, arranged in spikes at the ends of the leafy stems. Its fibrous leaves are used by local communities for weaving baskets and other traditional crafts. The species is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
