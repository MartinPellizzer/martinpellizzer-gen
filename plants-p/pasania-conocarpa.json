    "intro": "Pasania conocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is thick and rugged. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
