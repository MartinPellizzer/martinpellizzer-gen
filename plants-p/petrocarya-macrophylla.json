    "intro": "Petrocarya macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf petrocarya, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
