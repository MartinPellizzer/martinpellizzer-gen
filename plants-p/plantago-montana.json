    "intro": "Plantago montana, commonly known as mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows and along streambanks."
