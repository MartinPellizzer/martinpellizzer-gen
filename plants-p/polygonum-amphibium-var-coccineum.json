    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. coccineum, commonly known as the red marsh plant, is a variant of the common marsh knotweed. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves that often display a striking pink or red hue, especially in wet conditions. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats. The flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
