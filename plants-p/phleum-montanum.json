It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Phleum montanum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
