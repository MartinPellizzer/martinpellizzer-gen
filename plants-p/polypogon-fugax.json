    "intro": "Polypogon fugax, commonly known as the fugitive grass, is a small annual grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its rapid growth and short life cycle. Botanically, it is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
