    "intro": "Pernettya phillyreifolia var. araucana, commonly known as the Araucana cowberry, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of southern South America. It is a low-growing shrub with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red berries that are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
