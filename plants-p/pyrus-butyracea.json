    "intro": "Pyrus butyracea, commonly known as the butter pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
