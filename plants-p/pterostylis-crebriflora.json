    "intro": "Pterostylis crebriflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, hood-like flower spike that typically ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered closely together, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves the mimicry of female wasps to attract male pollinators."
