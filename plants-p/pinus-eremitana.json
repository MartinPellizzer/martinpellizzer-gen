    "intro": "Pinus eremitana, commonly known as the Spanish pine, is a species of conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs, and its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to survive in arid conditions."
