    "intro": "Pyrostria richardiae, commonly known as the Richard's pyrostria, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is known for its large, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors, which serve to attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrostria richardiae is considered an endangered species."
