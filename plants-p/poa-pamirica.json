    "intro": "Poa pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Central Asian mountain ranges, including the Pamirs and the Tien Shan. This perennial grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Poa pamirica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
