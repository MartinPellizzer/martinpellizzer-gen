    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and leaves, which give it its ethereal appearance. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to tree trunks or branches rather than growing in soil. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pale pink, are highly sought after for their beauty and rarity. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, Phalaenopsis pallens is considered a conservation concern."
