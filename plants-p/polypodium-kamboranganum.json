    "intro": "Polypodium kamboranganum, commonly known as the Kamborang fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into pinnate structures. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
