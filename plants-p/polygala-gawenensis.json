It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
