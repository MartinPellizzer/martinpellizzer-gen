    "intro": "Pellaea intermedia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
