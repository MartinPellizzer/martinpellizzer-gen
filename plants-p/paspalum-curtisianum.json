It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saltwater inundation. Paspalum curtisianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
