    "intro": "Pelea lohiauana, commonly known as the Hawaiian pelea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Pelea lohiauana is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
