    "intro": "Pandanus brosimos, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a large tree-like plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, fibrous stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into edible fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the fruit is consumed fresh or processed into beverages. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to humid and saline environments."
