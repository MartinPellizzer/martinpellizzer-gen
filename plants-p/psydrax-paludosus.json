It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, often growing in wetland or swampy environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain several seeds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. Psydrax paludosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
