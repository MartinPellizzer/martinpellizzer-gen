    "intro": "Pleiokirkia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, producing a showy display of white or pale yellow blooms. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Pleiokirkia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
