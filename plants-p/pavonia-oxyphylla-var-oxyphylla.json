    "intro": "Pavonia oxyphylla var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the scarlet pavonia, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that features showy, bright red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a beneficial addition to native plant landscapes."
