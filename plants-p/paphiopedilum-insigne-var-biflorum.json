    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces two to three flowers per inflorescence. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with deep red or purple markings, and the petals and sepals are often adorned with intricate patterns. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity in cultivation."
