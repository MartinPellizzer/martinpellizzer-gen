The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
