    "intro": "Pinus rigida subsp. typica, commonly known as the eastern white pine, is a coniferous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are usually 4 to 8 inches long, with scaly, reddish-brown bracts. Its bark is thin and scaly when young, becoming thicker and furrowed with age. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forests and woodlands."
