    "intro": "Plantago rugelii var. alterniflora, commonly known as the alternate-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, typical of many grass family members. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
