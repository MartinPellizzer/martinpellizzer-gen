    "intro": "Primula brachycalix, commonly known as the short-stalked primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens that seek early-season color."
