    "intro": "Plagiogyria pseudojaponica, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and small, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Plagiogyria pseudojaponica plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms."
