    "intro": "Pentameris oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pentameris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentameris oreophila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
