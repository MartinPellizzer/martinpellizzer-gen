    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia synandra, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as kahikatea and rimu. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, although it can also weaken its host plants over time."
