    "intro": "Peyritschia palmeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has small, yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the family. Peyritschia palmeri is adapted to harsh desert conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its growth is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
