    "intro": "Pojarkovia platyphylloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad and fleshy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
