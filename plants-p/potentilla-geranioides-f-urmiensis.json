It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, leathery leaves with a slightly hairy texture, typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
