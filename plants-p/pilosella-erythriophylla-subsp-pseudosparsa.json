    "intro": "Pilosella erythriophylla subsp. pseudosparsa, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas."
