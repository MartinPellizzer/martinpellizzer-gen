    "intro": "Pterocarpus claessensii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
