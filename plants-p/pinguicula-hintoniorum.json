    "intro": "Pinguicula hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers are small, usually pink or purple, and are borne on slender stalks above the leaf rosette. Pinguicula hintoniorum is a rare and specialized species, adapted to nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey."
