It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its flowers appear in early spring, preceding the leaves, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is grey and fissured."
