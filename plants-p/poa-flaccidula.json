It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Poa flaccidula is adapted to moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
