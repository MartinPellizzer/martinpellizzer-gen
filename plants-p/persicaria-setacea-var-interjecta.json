    "intro": "Persicaria setacea var. interjecta, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its overall fluffy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
