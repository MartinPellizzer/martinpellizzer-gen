    "intro": "Polystichum longipinnulum, commonly known as the long-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds."
