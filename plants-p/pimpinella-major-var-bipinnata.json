    "intro": "Pimpinella major var. bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural habitats."
