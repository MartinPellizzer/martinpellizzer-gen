    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found on exposed slopes and rocky outcrops. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
