    "intro": "Picridium derbesii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the summer months. Its flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed or sandy soils."
