    "intro": "Pleurothallis incurva, commonly known as the hooked pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Pleurothallis incurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
