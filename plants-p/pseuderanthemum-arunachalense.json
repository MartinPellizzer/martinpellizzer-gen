It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forest understories, preferring humid and cool climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
