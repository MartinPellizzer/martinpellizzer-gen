It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to salt spray and fluctuating tidal conditions."
