    "intro": "Pleurothallis periodica, commonly known as the periodic pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in the understory of the forest. Pleurothallis periodica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
