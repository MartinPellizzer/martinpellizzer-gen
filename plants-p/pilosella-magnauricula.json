    "intro": "Pilosella magnauricula, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Pilosella magnauricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
