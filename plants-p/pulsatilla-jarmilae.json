    "intro": "Pulsatilla jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other similar species. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flowers with petal-like sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
