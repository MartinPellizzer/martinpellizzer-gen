    "intro": "Pteris cristata, commonly known as the cristate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that create a dense, feather-like structure. Pteris cristata is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
