    "intro": "Pseudocampanula dzaaku, commonly known as the Zhaaku bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are upright and branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
