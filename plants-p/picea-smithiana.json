    "intro": "Picea smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles and conical shape, with a moderate growth rate. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. The wood of Picea smithiana is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
