It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it an ideal plant for container gardening and decorative displays."
