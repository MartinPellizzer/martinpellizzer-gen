    "intro": "Phaenixopus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to protect against harsh weather. Phaenixopus alpestris is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
