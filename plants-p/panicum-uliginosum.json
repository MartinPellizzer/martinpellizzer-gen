    "intro": "Panicum uliginosum, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
