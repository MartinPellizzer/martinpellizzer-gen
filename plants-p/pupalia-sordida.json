It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Its leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes."
