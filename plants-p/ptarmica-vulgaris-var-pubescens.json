    "intro": "Ptarmica vulgaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing feature that helps in its identification."
