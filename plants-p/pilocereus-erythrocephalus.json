It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are often segmented and can grow up to several meters in height. Pilocereus erythrocephalus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
