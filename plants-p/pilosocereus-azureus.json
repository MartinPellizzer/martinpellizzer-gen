    "intro": "Pilosocereus azureus, commonly known as the blue moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
