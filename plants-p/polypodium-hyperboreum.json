    "intro": "Polypodium hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic polypody, is a fern species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium hyperboreum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for cold climates."
