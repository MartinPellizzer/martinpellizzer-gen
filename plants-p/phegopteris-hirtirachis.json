    "intro": "Phegopteris hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, forming a rosette of fronds that can reach several feet in diameter. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, branching pattern that resembles the antlers of a stag. This fern is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance."
