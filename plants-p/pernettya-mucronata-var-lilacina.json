    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of delicate, lilac-pink flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its berries are edible but typically tart and used in local cuisines. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for wildlife."
