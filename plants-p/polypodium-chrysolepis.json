    "intro": "Polypodium chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, golden-brown coating, giving it its common name. Polypodium chrysolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
