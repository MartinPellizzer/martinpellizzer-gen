    "intro": "Pterocarpus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod containing flat, winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Pterocarpus parviflorus is also known for its aromatic bark and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
