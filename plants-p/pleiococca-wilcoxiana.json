    "intro": "Pleiococca wilcoxiana, commonly known as the Wilcox's pleiococca, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are often small and clustered, with distinctive colors that aid in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
