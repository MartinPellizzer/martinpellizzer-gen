    "intro": "Pentameris pholiuroides, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
