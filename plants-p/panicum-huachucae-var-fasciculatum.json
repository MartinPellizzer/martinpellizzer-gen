    "intro": "Panicum huachucae var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the Huachua grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
