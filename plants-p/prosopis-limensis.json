    "intro": "Prosopis limensis, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deep underground. Prosopis limensis is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
