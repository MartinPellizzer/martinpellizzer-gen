    "intro": "Podocarpus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate podocarp, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
