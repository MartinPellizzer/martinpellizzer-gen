    "intro": "Pilosella macranthela, commonly known as the showy pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are surrounded by silky, white bracts that give it a pearly appearance. Pilosella macranthela is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name and aiding in moisture retention."
