It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic appeal and durability. The tree has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
