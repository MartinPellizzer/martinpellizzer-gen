    "intro": "Piptatherum annulatum, commonly known as the ringed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive ring-like nodes along its stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Piptatherum annulatum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks."
