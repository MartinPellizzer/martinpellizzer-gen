    "intro": "Prosthechea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Prosthechea sessiliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
