It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
