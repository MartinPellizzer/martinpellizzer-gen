    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis var. elaeagrifolia, commonly known as the snow pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
