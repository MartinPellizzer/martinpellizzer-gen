    "intro": "Pabstiella hypnicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that often grows on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a leathery texture with distinct lobes and a pale green to yellowish color. Pabstiella hypnicola is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
