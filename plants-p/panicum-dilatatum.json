    "intro": "Panicum dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Panicum dilatatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
