    "intro": "Polycarpon polycarpoides var. herniarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf stickyseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers followed by small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Due to its low profile and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
