    "intro": "Praravinia verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf praravinia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Praravinia verruculosa is considered a species of conservation concern."
