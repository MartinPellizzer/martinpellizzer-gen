    "intro": "Psittacanthus cupulifer, commonly known as the cupulifer cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era, making it a living fossil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
