    "intro": "Palaquium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping palaquium, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Palaquium decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
