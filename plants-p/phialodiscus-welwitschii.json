    "intro": "Phialodiscus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest surviving plant species, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. Its distinctive seed cones are covered in a thick, fibrous layer that protects the seeds until they are ready to germinate. This plant is also notable for its ability to absorb moisture from fog, which is crucial for its survival in such a harsh environment."
