It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers in early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
