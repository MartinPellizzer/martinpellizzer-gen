It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and small, clustered cones. The tree typically grows in humid, mountainous regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
