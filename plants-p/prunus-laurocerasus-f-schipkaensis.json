It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are glossy and dark green, providing year-round visual interest. This form is typically smaller than the standard species, making it suitable for compact garden spaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticulture."
