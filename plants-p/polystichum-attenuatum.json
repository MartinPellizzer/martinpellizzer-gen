    "intro": "Polystichum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, narrow fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive attenuated (tapered) shape at the tips. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus, which are covered by a protective indusium."
