    "intro": "Platanthera setchuenica, commonly known as the Sichuan lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
