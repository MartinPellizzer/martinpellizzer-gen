    "intro": "Polypodium cheilostictum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue on the underside. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the leaves. Polypodium cheilostictum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
