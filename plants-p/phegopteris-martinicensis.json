    "intro": "Phegopteris martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are bioluminescent in some cases, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
