    "intro": "Pteris rottleriana, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pteris rottleriana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
