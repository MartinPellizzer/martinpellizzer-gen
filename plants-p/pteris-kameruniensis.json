    "intro": "Pteris kameruniensis, commonly known as the Cameroon water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which aid in water retention. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori that facilitate spore dispersal."
