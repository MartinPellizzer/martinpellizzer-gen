It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a distinctive, often serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release the seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
