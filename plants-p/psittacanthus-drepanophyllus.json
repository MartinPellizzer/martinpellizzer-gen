    "intro": "Psittacanthus drepanophyllus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and bright golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green bases. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form thick mats, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive star-like appearance when fully mature."
