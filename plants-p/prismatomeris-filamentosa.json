    "intro": "Prismatomeris filamentosa, commonly known as the filamentous sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, thread-like structures called filaments, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in saline environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
