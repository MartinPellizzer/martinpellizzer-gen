    "intro": "Polygala cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its low water requirements, it is well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
