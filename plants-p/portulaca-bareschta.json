    "intro": "Portulaca bareschta, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Portulaca bareschta is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
