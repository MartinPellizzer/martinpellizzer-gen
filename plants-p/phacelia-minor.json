It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Phacelia minor is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
