It is characterized by its hairy, veined leaves and elongated, sponge-like fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on pollinators for reproduction.
