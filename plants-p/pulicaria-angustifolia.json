    "intro": "Pulicaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It features silver-gray, narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Pulicaria angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
