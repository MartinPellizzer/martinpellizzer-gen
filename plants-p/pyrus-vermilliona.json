    "intro": "Pyrus vermilliona, commonly known as the vermillion pear, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red foliage in the autumn, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Pyrus vermilliona is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking seasonal color changes."
