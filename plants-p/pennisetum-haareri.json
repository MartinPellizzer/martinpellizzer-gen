It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. Pennisetum haareri prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for drought-tolerant landscapes."
