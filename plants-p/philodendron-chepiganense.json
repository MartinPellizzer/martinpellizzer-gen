    "intro": "Philodendron chepiganense, commonly known as the Chepiga philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green, often with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after houseplant, though it should be handled with care due to its toxic sap."
