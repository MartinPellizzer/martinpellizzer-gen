    "intro": "Phemeranthus, commonly known as the ephemeral flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their short-lived blooms, which often open only for a brief period before wilting. The flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors and intricate structures that attract pollinators. Phemeranthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Their botanical significance lies in their unique life cycle and role in their ecosystems."
