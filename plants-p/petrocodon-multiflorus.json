    "intro": "Petrocodon multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Petrocodon multiflorus is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
