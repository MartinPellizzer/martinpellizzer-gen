    "intro": "Pedilonum crenatifolium, commonly known as the scalloped-leaf pedilonum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Pedilonum crenatifolium is considered a conservation concern."
