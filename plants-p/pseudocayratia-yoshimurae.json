It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
