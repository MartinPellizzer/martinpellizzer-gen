    "intro": "Platostoma axillaris, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where it forms a crust-like growth on stone surfaces. The plant's structure is characterized by its dense, tightly packed thallus, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
