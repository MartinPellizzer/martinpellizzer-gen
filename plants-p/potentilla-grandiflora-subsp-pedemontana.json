    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora subsp. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
