    "intro": "Polypodium aromaticum, commonly known as the fragrant polypody, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves emit a subtle aromatic scent, which is believed to be a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
