    "intro": "Picea brevifolia var. semiprostrata, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a low-growing variant of the white spruce native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, prostrate growth habit, with short, spreading branches that often lie close to the ground. The foliage consists of small, scale-like needles that are typically a bluish-green color, providing a dense, uniform appearance. This variety is well adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its slow growth rate and resilience make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat in extreme conditions."
