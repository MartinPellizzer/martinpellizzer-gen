    "intro": "Potamogeton augustanus, commonly known as the August watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer. Potamogeton augustanus plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and can contribute to water clarity by stabilizing sediments."
