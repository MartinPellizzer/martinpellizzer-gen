    "intro": "Pogonia plicata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves and a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. It has a complex life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
