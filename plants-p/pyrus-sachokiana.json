    "intro": "Pyrus sachokiana, commonly known as the Indian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pears but have a distinct, tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
