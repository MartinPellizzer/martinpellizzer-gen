    "intro": "Phyllocladus trichomanoides var. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous phyllocladus, is a variant of the phyllocladus genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast to its green stems. The plant features flattened, scale-like leaves known as phylloclades, which are modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and adaptation to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
