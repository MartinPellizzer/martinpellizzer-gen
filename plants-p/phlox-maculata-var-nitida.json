It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release seeds when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
