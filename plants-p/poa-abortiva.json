    "intro": "Poa abortiva, commonly known as the abortive bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairless leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Botanically, Poa abortiva is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can contribute to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
