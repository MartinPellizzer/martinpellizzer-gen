    "intro": "Phegopteris thelipteroides, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sori arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are subterranean, allowing it to spread vegetatively through rhizome growth. The fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
