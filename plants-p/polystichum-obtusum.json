    "intro": "Polystichum obtusum, commonly known as the blunt holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a lush, fern-like appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
