    "intro": "Pterocephalus sanctus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy layer that helps retain moisture. The sacred lotus is not only valued for its aesthetic beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
