The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Potentilla supina var. ternata is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
