It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features elliptical, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like berries that are dark red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blooms and autumn color."
