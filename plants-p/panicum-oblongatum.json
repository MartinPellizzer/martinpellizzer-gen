It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Panicum oblongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
