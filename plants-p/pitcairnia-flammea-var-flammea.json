    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. flammea, commonly known as the Flame Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange, which contribute to its dramatic appearance. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
