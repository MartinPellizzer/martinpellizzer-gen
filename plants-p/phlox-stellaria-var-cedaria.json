    "intro": "Phlox stellaria var. cedaria, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy choice for gardens. Its compact form and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to wildflower meadows and rock gardens."
