It features dense, velvety foliage with a distinctive hairy texture, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and dark green coloration. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements."
