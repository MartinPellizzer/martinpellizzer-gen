    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. oligoclada, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact form of the white spruce native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This variety is characterized by its slower growth rate and dense, pyramidal shape, making it well-suited for rock gardens and small spaces. Its foliage consists of sharp, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that mature in the second year, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in cooler, moist climates."
