    "intro": "Phegopteris armata, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
