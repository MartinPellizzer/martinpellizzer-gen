    "intro": "Pennisetum sericeum, commonly known as blue fescue, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest in late summer and autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Pennisetum sericeum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
