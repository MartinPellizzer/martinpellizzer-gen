    "intro": "Polygala guantanamana var. scabridula, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy or scabrous leaves, which give it its varietal name \"scabridula.\" It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
