    "intro": "Pseudolasiacis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
