    "intro": "Phreatia ganggapensis, commonly known as the Ganggap orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple or red markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
