    "intro": "Philodendron bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
