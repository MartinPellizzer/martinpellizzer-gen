    "intro": "Picea bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive two-leaved appearance on its shoots. The leaves are typically needle-like, short, and arranged in pairs along the stems. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests."
