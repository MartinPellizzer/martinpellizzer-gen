    "intro": "Patagonium obovatum, commonly known as the Patagonian broadleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in arid and semi-arid regions of Patagonia."
