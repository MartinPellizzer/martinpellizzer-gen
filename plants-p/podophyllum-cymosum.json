    "intro": "Podophyllum cymosum, commonly known as the clustered mayapple, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like cluster of leaves at the base, with a single flower emerging from the center. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shaded forest floors. Podophyllum cymosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
