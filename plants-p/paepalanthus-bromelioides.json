    "intro": "Paepalanthus bromelioides, commonly known as the false bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, though it lacks the typical rosette structure of true bromeliads. The plant features vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Paepalanthus bromelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small animals and insects."
