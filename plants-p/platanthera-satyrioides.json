    "intro": "Platanthera satyrioides, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
