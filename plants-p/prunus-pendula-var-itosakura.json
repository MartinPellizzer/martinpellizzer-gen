It is native to Japan and is prized for its delicate, pinkish-white blossoms that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet, with a rounded, weeping form that adds ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The flowers are not only aesthetically pleasing but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
