    "intro": "Prunus sibirica var. davidiana, commonly known as the David's Siberian apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits that are similar in appearance to apricots. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in colder climates and well-drained soils."
