    "intro": "Psephellus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
