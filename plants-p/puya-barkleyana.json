    "intro": "Puya barkleyana, commonly known as the Andes lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom for only a few days. Puya barkleyana is known for its long-lived rosette of broad, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
