    "intro": "Pentacalia cobrensis, commonly known as the Cobren's pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its stems are often hairy as well. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentacalia cobrensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
