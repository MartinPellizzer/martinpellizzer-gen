    "intro": "Parapolystichum currorii subsp. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless cliff fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are densely arranged along the rachis. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
