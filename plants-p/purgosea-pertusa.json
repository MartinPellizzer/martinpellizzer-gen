It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Purgosea pertusa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
