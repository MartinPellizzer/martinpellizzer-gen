    "intro": "Populus trichocarpa f. ingrata, commonly known as the roughleaf cottonwood, is a variant of the black cottonwood characterized by its rugged, irregular bark and smaller, more densely packed leaves. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to flood-prone environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
