    "intro": "Potentilla porrigens, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Potentilla porrigens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
