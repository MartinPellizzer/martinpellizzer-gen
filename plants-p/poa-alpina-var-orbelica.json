It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
