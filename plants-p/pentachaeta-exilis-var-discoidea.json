It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
