It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive pattern of green and purple spots. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Pulmonaria primuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
