    "intro": "Pleopeltis obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture from the air. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a distinctive, rounded shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
