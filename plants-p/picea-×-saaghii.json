    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 saaghii, commonly known as the Sitka white spruce hybrid, is a cross between the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and the white spruce (Picea glauca). It is a medium to large evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. The tree has slender, gray-green needles and produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and landscapes. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a unique example of natural hybridization in the genus Picea."
