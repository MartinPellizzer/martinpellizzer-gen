    "intro": "Pinalia shanensis, commonly known as the Shan pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a tall trunk and a conical crown, typical of many pine species. Due to habitat loss, Pinalia shanensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
