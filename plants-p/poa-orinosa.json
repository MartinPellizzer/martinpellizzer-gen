    "intro": "Poa orinosa, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in high-altitude regions, such as the Andes Mountains. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, paired structures containing the flowers. Poa orinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
