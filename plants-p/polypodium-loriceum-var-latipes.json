    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. latipes, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, lanceolate fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical gardens."
