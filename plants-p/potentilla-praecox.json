    "intro": "Potentilla praecox, commonly known as early potentilla, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Potentilla praecox thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas."
