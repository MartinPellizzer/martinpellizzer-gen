    "intro": "Pelexia asinus, commonly known as the donkey's ear, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy, donkey-ear-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
