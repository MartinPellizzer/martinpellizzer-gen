    "intro": "Ptiloria ramosa, commonly known as the branched milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature. Ptiloria ramosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
