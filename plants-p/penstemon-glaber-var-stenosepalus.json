    "intro": "Penstemon glaber var. stenosepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepal penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the plant family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
