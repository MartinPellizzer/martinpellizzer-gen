    "intro": "Phormium bulbiferum, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a striking ornamental plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces striking purple or red flower spikes in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, fibrous bracts. Its leaves are used for weaving and traditional crafts, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Phormium bulbiferum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
