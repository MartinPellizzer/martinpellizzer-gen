    "intro": "Primulina pinnatifida, commonly known as the feather-leaf caladium, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that display vibrant shades of green, red, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not showy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
