    "intro": "Puccinellia svalbardensis, commonly known as the Svalbard rush, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions, particularly Svalbard. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Puccinellia svalbardensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme seasonal variations."
