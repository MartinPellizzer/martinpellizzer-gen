    "intro": "Prosorus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom only during the brief twilight hours, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, Prosorus is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological and scientific value."
