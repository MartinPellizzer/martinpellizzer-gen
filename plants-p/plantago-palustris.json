    "intro": "Plantago palustris, commonly known as common plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It is often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its medicinal properties have been recognized for centuries, with its leaves used to treat wounds and skin irritations."
