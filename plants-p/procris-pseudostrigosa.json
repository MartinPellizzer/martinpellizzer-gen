    "intro": "Procris pseudostrigosa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, with a distinct three-lobed lip. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Procris pseudostrigosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky outcrops and sandy plains."
