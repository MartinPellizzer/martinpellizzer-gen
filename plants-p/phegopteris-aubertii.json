    "intro": "Phegopteris aubertii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
