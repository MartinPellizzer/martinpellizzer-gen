It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its ability to thrive in a range of water conditions, it is often found in lakes, rivers, and slow-moving streams."
