    "intro": "Phippsia concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phippsia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
