    "intro": "Polypodium catharinae var. latipes, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in crevices. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
