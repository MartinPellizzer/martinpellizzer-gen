    "intro": "Pulsatilla jankae var. vojvodinae, commonly known as the Vojvodina pasqueflower, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms with purple petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. It has a short stem with a single flower, and its leaves are divided into lobes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
