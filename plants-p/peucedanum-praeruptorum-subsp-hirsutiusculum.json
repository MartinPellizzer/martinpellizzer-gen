    "intro": "Peucedanum praeruptorum subsp. hirsutiusculum, commonly known as the hairy cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. It is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its genus."
