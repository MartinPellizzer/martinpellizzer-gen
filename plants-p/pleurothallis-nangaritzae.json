    "intro": "Pleurothallis nangaritzae, commonly known as the Nangaritza orchid, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
