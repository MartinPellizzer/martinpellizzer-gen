    "intro": "Psoralea pungens, commonly known as the spiny psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Australia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish or greenish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, stiff leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often growing on rocky soils and in areas with low rainfall. Psoralea pungens is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in its native habitats."
