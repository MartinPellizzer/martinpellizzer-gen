    "intro": "Picea pungens f. perpendicularis, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a cultivar of the blue spruce species native to the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray needles and a conical shape that becomes more columnar with age. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively cold-hardy. The foliage retains its color year-round, making it a popular choice for winter interest in the landscape."
