It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and threatened species."
