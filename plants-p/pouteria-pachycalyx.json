    "intro": "Pouteria pachycalyx, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor. The tree's most notable feature is its large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife."
