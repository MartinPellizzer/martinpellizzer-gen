    "intro": "Paspalum distichum subsp. vaginatum, commonly known as the flatleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is often found in wetland and marsh environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
