    "intro": "Potentilla fragarioides var. togasii, commonly known as Togasii cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
