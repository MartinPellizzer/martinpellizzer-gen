    "intro": "Panax aesculifolia, commonly known as the horse chestnut ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its botanical and pharmacological uses remains limited. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in specialized botanical gardens or conservation programs."
