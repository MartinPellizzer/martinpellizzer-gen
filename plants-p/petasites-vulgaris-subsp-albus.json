    "intro": "Petasites vulgaris subsp. albus, commonly known as the white edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, white, woolly flower heads that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
