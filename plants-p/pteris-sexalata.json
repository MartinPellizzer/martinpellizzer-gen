    "intro": "Pteris sexalata, commonly known as the six-angled water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often described as resembling the shape of a heart or a star. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Pteris sexalata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
