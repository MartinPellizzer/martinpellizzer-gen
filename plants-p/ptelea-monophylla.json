    "intro": "Ptelea monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged singly along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
