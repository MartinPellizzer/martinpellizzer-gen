    "intro": "Pilosella perileuca, commonly known as the paleleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, typical of the daisy family. Pilosella perileuca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
