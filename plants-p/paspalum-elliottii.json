It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Paspalum elliottii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
