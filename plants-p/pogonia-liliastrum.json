    "intro": "Pogonia liliastrum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
