    "intro": "Polystichum unitum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum unitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
