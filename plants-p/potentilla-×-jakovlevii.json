It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
