    "intro": "Poa badensis subsp. molinerii, commonly known as the Moliner's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
