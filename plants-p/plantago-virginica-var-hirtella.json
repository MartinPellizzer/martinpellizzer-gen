It features rosettes of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
