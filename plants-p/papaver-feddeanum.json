It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, cup-shaped corona surrounded by petals.
