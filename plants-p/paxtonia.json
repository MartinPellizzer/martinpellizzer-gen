    "intro": "Paxtonia, commonly known as the yellow poplar or western catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Paxtonia is valued in horticulture for its rapid growth, ornamental value, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
