    "intro": "Pilea floribunda, commonly known as the shining pilea, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea floribunda is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
