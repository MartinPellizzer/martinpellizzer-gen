    "intro": "Pescatoria dormaniana, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong scent. Due to habitat loss, Pescatoria dormaniana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
