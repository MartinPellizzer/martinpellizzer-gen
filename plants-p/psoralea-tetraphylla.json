    "intro": "Psoralea tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Psoralea tetraphylla is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
