    "intro": "Platanthera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is often found in association with other orchids and is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats."
