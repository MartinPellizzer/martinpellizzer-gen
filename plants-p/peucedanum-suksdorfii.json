    "intro": "Peucedanum suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf's angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are schizocarps, typical of the Apiaceae family, and consist of two mericarps that separate at maturity. Peucedanum suksdorfii is valued for its potential medicinal properties and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
