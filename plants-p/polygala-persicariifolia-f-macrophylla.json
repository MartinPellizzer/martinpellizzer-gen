    "intro": "Polygala persicariifolia f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygalaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are typically larger than those of the typical species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
