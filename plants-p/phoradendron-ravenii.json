    "intro": "Phoradendron ravenii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Dipteryx. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Phoradendron ravenii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
