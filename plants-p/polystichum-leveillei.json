    "intro": "Polystichum leveillei, commonly known as the Leveille's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a compact, upright habit. Polystichum leveillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
