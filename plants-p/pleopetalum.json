    "intro": "Pleopetalum, commonly known as the \"star flower\" or \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plants are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Pleopetalum species are herbaceous perennials, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Their botanical features include hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the species."
