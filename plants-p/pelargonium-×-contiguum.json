    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 contiguum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from several pelargonium species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that often have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant for hanging baskets and containers due to its compact form and continuous flowering. Pelargonium \u00d7 contiguum is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
