    "intro": "Pedicularis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble small lice, hence its common name. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and moist environments. Its striking red or orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
