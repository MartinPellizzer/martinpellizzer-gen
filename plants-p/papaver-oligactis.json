    "intro": "Papaver oligactis, commonly known as the lesser poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive black center, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The seeds are small and contained within a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
