It is characterized by its dense, fibrous foliage and robust growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in savannas and grasslands. Due to its high biomass and nutritional value, it is widely used as forage for livestock in many parts of the world."
