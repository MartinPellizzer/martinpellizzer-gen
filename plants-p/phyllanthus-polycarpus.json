It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Phyllanthus polycarpus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
