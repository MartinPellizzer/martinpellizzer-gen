    "intro": "Physocarpus insularis, commonly known as the island baccharis, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of maritime forests. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal landscapes."
