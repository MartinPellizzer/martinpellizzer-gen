    "intro": "Pentanema alanyense, commonly known as the Alanyan pentanema, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in coastal environments."
