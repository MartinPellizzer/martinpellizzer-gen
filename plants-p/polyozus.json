    "intro": "Polyozus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
