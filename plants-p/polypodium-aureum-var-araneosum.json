    "intro": "Polypodium aureum var. araneosum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
