    "intro": "Polypodium carpinterae, commonly known as the Carpinthia fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium carpinterae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
