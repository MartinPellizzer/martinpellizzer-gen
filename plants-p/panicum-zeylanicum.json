    "intro": "Panicum zeylanicum, commonly known as kallar grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in wet or disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along water bodies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions but also has potential uses in erosion control and as a forage crop."
