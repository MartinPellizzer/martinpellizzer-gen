    "intro": "Poa mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters and warm summers. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Poa mediterranea is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive lawns."
