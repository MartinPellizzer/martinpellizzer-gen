    "intro": "Polygonum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Polygonum dichotomum is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
