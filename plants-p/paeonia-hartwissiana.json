It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant features palmately divided, dark green leaves and is often found growing in rocky or well-drained soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical gardens."
