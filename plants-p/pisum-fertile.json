    "intro": "Pisum fertile, commonly known as the common pea, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, known as peas, which are the edible part. Pisum fertile is native to the Mediterranean region and has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is valued for its nutritional content and its role in crop rotation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
