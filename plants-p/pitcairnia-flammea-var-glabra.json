    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. glabra, commonly known as the flame pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that surround its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name \"glabra.\" The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
