    "intro": "Potentilla subcernavodae, commonly known as the Moldavian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Romania and Bulgaria. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
