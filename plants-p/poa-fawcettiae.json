    "intro": "Poa fawcettiae, commonly known as Fawcett's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa fawcettiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
