    "intro": "Peltopus scutifer, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds, which are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
