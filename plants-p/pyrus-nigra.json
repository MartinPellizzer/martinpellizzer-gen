    "intro": "Pyrus nigra, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue-black berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant is also notable for its ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
