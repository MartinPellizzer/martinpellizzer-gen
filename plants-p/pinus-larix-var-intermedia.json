    "intro": "Pinus larix var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate larch, is a hybrid conifer that exhibits characteristics of both the larch (Larix) and the true fir (Pinus). It is a tall, slender tree with long, needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The cones are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive shape that aids in seed dispersal. This species is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in cooler, moist climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant in suitable environments."
