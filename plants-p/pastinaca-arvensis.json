    "intro": "Pastinaca arvensis, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are cylindrical and often have a distinct, aromatic odor. Wild parsnip is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
