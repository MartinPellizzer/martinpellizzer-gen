It is characterized by its spherical or nearly spherical pods, which are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. The plant is a climbing vine with trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are usually small and wrinkled, with a mild, nutty flavor. This variety is valued for its historical significance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique morphology and heritage."
