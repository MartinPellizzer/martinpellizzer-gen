    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
