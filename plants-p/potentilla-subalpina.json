    "intro": "Potentilla subalpina, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, preferring well-drained conditions and full sun. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, contributing to its common name. Potentilla subalpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments."
