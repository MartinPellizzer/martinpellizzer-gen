    "intro": "Pilgerochloa major, commonly known as the broadleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and wide, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Pilgerochloa major is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
