    "intro": "Plagiobothrys fulvus var. campestris, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
