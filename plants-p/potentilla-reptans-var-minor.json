    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. minor, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
