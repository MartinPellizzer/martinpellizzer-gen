    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. macropoda, commonly known as the Flame Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that surround its compact inflorescence, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is noted for its ability to bloom repeatedly, adding visual interest over several years."
