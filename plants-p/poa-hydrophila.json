    "intro": "Poa hydrophila, commonly known as the water meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
