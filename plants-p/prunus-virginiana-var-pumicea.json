    "intro": "Prunus virginiana var. pumicea, commonly known as the pumice cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pumice-like bark, which is rough and fissured, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
