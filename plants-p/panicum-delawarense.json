    "intro": "Panicum delawarense, commonly known as the Delawareset grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
