    "intro": "Paspalum millegranum, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Paspalum millegranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
