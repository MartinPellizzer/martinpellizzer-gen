    "intro": "Pandanus quinarius, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their fibrous texture. Pandanus quinarius thrives in humid, coastal environments and is well adapted to saline conditions."
