    "intro": "Polium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping polium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Polium fruticosum is typically perennial and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
