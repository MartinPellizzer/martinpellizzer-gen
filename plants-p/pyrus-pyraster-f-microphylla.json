    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
