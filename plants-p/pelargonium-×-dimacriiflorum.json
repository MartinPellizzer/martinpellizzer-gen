    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 dimacriiflorum, commonly known as the double-flowered geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, double blooms that consist of multiple layers of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical geraniums. The plant typically grows as an annual or tender perennial, with upright stems and serrated leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
