    "intro": "Phegopteris obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound fronds that are often divided into broad, oblong segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, which adds to its ornamental value in garden settings."
