    "intro": "Potamogeton filiformis f. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine filiform pondweed, is a subspecies of the filamentous pondweed native to colder, high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. This plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in alpine lakes and streams. Its growth is limited by low temperatures, making it a rare and specialized aquatic plant. The subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
