It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Phanera parvifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
