    "intro": "Parmentiera lanceolata, commonly known as the Mexican candlewood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, ridged, and often spiny stems. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by long, narrow fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
