    "intro": "Pilosella grisea, commonly known as the gray pilosella, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a grayish-white pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a cluster, and it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. Pilosella grisea is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
