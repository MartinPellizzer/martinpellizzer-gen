    "intro": "Pepinia kunhardtiana, commonly known as the Kunhardt's pincushion, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pepinia kunhardtiana is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
