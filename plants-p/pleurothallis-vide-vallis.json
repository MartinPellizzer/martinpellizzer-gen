    "intro": "Pleurothallis vide-vallis, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its name, \"vide-vallis,\" is derived from Latin, meaning \"see the valley,\" likely referring to its subtle appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
