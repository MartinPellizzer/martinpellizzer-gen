It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
