It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its adaptability and rapid growth contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance."
