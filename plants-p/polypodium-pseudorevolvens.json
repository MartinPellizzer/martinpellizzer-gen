    "intro": "Polypodium pseudorevolvens, commonly known as the false rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium pseudorevolvens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
