    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. nana, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming habit with small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in moist, open habitats. Its compact growth and early blooming make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
