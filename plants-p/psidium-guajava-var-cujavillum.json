    "intro": "Psidium guajava var. cujavillum, commonly known as the white guava, is a variant of the common guava characterized by its pale white to pinkish flowers and small, smooth, white fruits. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with glossy, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruits are usually less succulent and have a sweeter, more delicate flavor compared to the common guava. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in tropical cuisines."
