    "intro": "Polypodium conjunctisorum, commonly known as the clustered wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
