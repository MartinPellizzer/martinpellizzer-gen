It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, enclosed by a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
