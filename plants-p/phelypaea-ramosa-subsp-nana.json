It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in tight inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Phelypaea ramosa."
