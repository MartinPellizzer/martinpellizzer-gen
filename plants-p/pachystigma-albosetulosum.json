    "intro": "Pachystigma albosetulosum, commonly known as the white-fringed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive white or pale green fringe along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
