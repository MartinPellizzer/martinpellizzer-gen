    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
