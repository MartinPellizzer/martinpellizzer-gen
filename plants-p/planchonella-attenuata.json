    "intro": "Planchonella attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Planchonella attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and floral display."
