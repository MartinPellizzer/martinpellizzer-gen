    "intro": "Ptelea villosula, commonly known as the silky ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The silky ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
