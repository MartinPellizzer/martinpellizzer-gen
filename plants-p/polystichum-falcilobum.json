    "intro": "Polystichum falcilobum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It features tall, arching fronds with a distinctive, sword-like shape and a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Polystichum falcilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
