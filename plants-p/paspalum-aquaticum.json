    "intro": "Paspalum aquaticum, commonly known as water paspalum, is a grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across waterlogged soils. The plant typically has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to repel water. Paspalum aquaticum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
