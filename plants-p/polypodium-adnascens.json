    "intro": "Polypodium adnascens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are typically divided into lanceolate segments with a serrated margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are released from small, fleshy sporangia located on the underside of the leaves."
