    "intro": "Piper nitidifolium, commonly known as the glossy-leaf pepper, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, shiny, and often dark green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, yellowish berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
