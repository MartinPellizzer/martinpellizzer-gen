    "intro": "Pachyphyllum cuencae, commonly known as the Cuenca stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and unique leaf structure make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pachyphyllum cuencae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
