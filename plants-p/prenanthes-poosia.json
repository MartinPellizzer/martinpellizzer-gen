    "intro": "Prenanthes poosia, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a prominent, spiky bract. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Prenanthes poosia is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
