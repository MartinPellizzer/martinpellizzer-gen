It features a tall, slender rhizome with dark brown, fibrous roots. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with lanceolate, serrated, and slightly curled leaflets. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
