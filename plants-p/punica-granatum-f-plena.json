    "intro": "Punica granatum f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate plant characterized by its dense, double blooms. It features showy, bright red flowers that are more abundant and clustered than those of the typical pomegranate. The plant retains the typical structure of Punica granatum, with broad, leathery leaves and a shrub-like growth habit. It is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display. While it does produce fruit, the fruits are often smaller and less flavorful compared to the standard variety."
