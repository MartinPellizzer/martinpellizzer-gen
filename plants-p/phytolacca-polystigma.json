It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its botanical structure includes a thick, fleshy root system and a woody stem that becomes more prominent as the plant matures."
