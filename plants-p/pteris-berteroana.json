    "intro": "Pteris berteroana, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait among ferns. Pteris berteroana is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
