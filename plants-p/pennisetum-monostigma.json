    "intro": "Pennisetum monostigma, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its fountain-like growth habit, with slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, seed-filled plumes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is drought-tolerant once established. Pennisetum monostigma is also valued for its ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
