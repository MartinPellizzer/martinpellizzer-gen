It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium occidentale is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
