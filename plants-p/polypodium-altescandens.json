    "intro": "Polypodium altescandens, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, holly-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Polypodium altescandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
