    "intro": "Prenanthes \u00d7 mainensis, commonly known as the hybrid water hemp, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. It is often found in the eastern United States and can be distinguished by its slender stems and lack of a strong odor. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in wetland restoration projects."
