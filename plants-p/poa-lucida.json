    "intro": "Poa lucida, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa lucida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
