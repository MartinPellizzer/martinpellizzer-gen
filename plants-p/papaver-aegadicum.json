    "intro": "Papaver aegadicum, commonly known as the Canary Island poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Canary Islands. It produces striking, showy flowers with bright orange petals and a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant has a short stem with few leaves, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across the archipelago."
