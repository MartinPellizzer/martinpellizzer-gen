It is characterized by its spiny leaves and composite flower heads that typically consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, Polyrhabda species often thrive in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant's structure includes a stout, woody stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Polyrhabda is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and has some historical uses in traditional medicine."
