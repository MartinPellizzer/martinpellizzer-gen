    "intro": "Ptycholepis ditassoides, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
