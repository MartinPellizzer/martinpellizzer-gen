It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
