    "intro": "Polypodium geraniifolium, commonly known as the geranium-leaved polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, finely divided, and serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
