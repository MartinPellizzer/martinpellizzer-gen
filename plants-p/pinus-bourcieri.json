It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for thousands of years. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that contain seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
