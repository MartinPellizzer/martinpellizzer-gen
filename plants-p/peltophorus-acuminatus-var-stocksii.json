    "intro": "Peltophorus acuminatus var. stocksii, commonly known as the Stocksii lichen, is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark and soil in temperate regions. It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct lobes and a finely granular surface. The apothecia are small, circular, and often embedded in the thallus, with a smooth, dark brown to black margin. It is characterized by its simple structure and lack of prominent rhizines. This lichen is often found in shaded, humid environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
