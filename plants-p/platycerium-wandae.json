    "intro": "Platycerium wandae, commonly known as the Wanda\u2019s staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the central stem, forming a striking, tree-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a sturdy surface to anchor itself, often growing on trees or rocks. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a visually impressive addition to tropical gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
