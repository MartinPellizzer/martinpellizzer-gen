    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf cinereal potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
