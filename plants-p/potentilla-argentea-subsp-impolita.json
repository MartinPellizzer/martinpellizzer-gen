    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. impolita, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-white undersides on its leaves, which are typically oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
