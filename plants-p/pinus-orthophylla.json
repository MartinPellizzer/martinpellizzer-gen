    "intro": "Pinus orthophylla, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to western North America. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of two, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing seeds surrounded by a woody covering. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and full sunlight. Pinus orthophylla plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for numerous wildlife species."
