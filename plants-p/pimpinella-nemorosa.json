    "intro": "Pimpinella nemorosa, commonly known as wood anise, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that splits open when mature. Pimpinella nemorosa is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it has a mild, licorice-like scent."
