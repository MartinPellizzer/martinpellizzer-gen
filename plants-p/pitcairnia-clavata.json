It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup.

It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Pitcairnia clavata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
