    "intro": "Prenanthes fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the fruit is a small, bladder-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. Prenanthes fauriei is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
