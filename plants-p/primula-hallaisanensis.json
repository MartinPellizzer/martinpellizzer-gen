    "intro": "Primula hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Korean peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing vibrant yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
