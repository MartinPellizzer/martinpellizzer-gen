    "intro": "Poa bactriana subsp. glabriflora, commonly known as the Afghan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with glabrous (hairless) florets, which is a distinguishing feature of the subspecies. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
