    "intro": "Pinus mariesii, commonly known as the Maries pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
