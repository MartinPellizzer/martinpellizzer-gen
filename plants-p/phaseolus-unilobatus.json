It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. Its seeds are edible when mature and are often used in culinary applications. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
