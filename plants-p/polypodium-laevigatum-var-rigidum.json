It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds. Its fronds are rigid and have a leathery texture, which distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
