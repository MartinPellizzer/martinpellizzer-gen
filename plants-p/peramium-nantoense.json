    "intro": "Peramium nantoense, commonly known as the Philippine sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional crafts and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in lowland to montane forest areas. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
