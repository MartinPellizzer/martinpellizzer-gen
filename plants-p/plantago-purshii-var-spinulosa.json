    "intro": "Plantago purshii var. spinulosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its historical use in traditional medicine."
