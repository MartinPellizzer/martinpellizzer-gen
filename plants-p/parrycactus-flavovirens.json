    "intro": "Parrycactus flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green parrycactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
