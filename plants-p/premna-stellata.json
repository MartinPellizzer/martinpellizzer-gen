    "intro": "Premna stellata, commonly known as the starleaf premna, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive star-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Premna stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
