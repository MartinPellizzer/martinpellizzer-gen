    "intro": "Psorothamnus tinctorius, commonly known as the redbush or desert bursage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological stability and traditional use in some indigenous communities."
