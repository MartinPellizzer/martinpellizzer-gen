It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
