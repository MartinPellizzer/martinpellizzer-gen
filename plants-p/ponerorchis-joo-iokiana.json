It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and delicate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which are adapted for specific pollinators. Its habitat is restricted to high-altitude forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
