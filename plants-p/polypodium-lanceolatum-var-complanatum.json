    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. complanatum, commonly known as the flat-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often flat or slightly folded. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The leaves are usually dark green and remain semi-evergreen throughout the year."
