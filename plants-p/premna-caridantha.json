It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Premna caridantha is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
