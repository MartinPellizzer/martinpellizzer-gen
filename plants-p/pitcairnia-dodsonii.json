    "intro": "Pitcairnia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in epiphytic plants. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
