    "intro": "Pinus spinosa, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fires and harsh weather. Pinus spinosa is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
