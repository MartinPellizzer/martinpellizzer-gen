    "intro": "Pseudocalyx macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf pseudocalyx, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
