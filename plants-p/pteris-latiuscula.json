    "intro": "Pteris latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance."
