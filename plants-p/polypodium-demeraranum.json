    "intro": "Polypodium demeraranum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium demeraranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
