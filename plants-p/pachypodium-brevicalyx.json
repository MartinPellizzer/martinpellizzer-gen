    "intro": "Pachypodium brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short trunk and sparse, spiny branches. Its leaves are small and often modified into spines, reducing water loss. It produces small yellow flowers during the dry season, which are pollinated by insects."
