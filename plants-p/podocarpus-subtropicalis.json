    "intro": "Podocarpus subtropicalis, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp, is a evergreen coniferous tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces cones, with male cones releasing pollen and female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical and temperate forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in various horticultural settings."
