    "intro": "Passiflora pubescens, commonly known as the hairy passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a unique central crown of filaments. Its fruit is a bright orange, edible berry that ripens in late summer. Passiflora pubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
