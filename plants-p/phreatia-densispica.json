    "intro": "Phreatia densispica, commonly known as the dense-spiked orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Phreatia densispica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to grow in a variety of indoor and outdoor conditions."
