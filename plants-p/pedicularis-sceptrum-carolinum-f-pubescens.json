    "intro": "Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum f. pubescens, commonly known as the Showy Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces a single, intricate flower at the top. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as meadows and forested areas at high elevations. The varietal form 'pubescens' is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat."
