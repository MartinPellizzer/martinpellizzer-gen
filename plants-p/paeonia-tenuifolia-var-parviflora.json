    "intro": "Paeonia tenuifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peony with small flowers, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers with a subtle scent, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage and modest blooms. This variety is less common in cultivation compared to other peony species."
