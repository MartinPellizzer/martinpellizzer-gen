    "intro": "Psephellus barbeyi, commonly known as the Barbey's psephellus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psephellus barbeyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
