    "intro": "Pouteria cuspidata subsp. dura, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its hard, woody fruit, which contains a single large seed surrounded by a toxic, fibrous husk. The seed, once processed, is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. This species plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
