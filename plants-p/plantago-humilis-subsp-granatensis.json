    "intro": "Plantago humilis subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild astringent properties."
