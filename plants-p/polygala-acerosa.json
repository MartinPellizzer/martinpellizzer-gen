    "intro": "Polygala acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Polygala acerosa is part of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures."
