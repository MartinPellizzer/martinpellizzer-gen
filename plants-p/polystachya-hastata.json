    "intro": "Polystachya hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridophyte, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that often exhibit a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are arranged in compact clusters along the fronds. Polystachya hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
