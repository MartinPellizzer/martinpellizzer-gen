It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features long, narrow leaves covered in fine, soft hairs that give it its common name. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones located on the underside of the fronds. Poikilogyne furfuracea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
