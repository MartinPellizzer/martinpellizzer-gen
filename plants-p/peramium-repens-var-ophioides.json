    "intro": "Peramium repens var. ophioides, commonly known as the creeping peramium, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features thin, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
