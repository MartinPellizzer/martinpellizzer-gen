    "intro": "Primula congestifolia, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a herbaceous perennial with oval, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
