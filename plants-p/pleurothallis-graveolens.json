It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white to pale yellow blooms that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique aroma and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
