It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that are often used in seed propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
