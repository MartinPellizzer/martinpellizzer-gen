    "intro": "Pharmacosycea radula, commonly known as the medicinal liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thallus-like structure that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body composed of specialized cells. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rock surfaces or in damp, shaded environments. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
