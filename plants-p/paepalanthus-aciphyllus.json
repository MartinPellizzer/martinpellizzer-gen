It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that serve as modified stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and rockeries."
