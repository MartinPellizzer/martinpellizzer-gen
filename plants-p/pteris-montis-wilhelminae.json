    "intro": "Pteris montis-wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pteris montis-wilhelminae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
