    "intro": "Poa fertilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its smooth texture and adaptability make it a common component of natural grasslands."
