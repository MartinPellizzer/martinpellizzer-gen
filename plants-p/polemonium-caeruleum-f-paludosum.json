    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum f. paludosum, commonly known as the marsh bluebead, is a variant of the bluebead lily that thrives in wetland environments. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purplish flowers. It has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapting to waterlogged soils. The species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it well-suited for wetland restoration projects and ecological gardens."
