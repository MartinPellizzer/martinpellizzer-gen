    "intro": "Platanthera sachalinensis var. hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
