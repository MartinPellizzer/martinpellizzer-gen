It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
