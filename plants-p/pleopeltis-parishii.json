    "intro": "Pleopeltis parishii, commonly known as the Parry's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds with a distinctive, segmented structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture, making it well adapted to its epiphytic lifestyle."
