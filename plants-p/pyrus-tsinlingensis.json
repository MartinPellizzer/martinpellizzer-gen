    "intro": "Pyrus tsinlingensis, commonly known as the Tsingling pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and orchards in its native habitat."
