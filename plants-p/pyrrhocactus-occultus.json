    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus occultus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, spiky, and often pale green or bluish-gray stems that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmest months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many cacti that helps reduce water loss. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Pyrrhocactus occultus is considered a critically endangered species."
