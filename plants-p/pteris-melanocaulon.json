    "intro": "Pteris melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stem maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive dark brown, wiry stem that contrasts with its light green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this particular variety does not exhibit that trait."
