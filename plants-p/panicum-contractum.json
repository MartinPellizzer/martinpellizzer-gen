    "intro": "Panicum contractum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, two-lobed flowers. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
