    "intro": "Pellaea nivea f. flavens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and striking variant of the silver fern. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow fronds, which contrast sharply with the typical silvery hue of the species. This fern is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is composed of tightly packed, leathery leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
