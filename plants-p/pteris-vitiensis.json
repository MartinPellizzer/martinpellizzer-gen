    "intro": "Pteris vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris vitiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
