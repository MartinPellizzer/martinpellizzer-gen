    "intro": "Phragmanthera polycrypta subsp. polycrypta, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
