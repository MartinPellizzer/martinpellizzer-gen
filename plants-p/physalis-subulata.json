    "intro": "Physalis subulata, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, inflated calyces that enclose small, edible berries. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, pointed leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The fruit, which ripens to a yellow or orange color, is often used in traditional cuisines for its tart flavor."
