    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are adapted to cold and windy environments. This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation in response to environmental stressors, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
