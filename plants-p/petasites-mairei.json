    "intro": "Petasites mairei, commonly known as the Maire's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface and a distinct central vein. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the development of a large, edible tuberous root. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
