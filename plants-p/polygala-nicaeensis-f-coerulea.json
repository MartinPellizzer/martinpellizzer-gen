    "intro": "Polygala nicaeensis f. coerulea, commonly known as the Blue-Flowered Polygala, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
