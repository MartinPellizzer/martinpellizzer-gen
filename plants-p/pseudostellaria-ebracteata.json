    "intro": "Pseudostellaria ebracteata, commonly known as the naked starwort, is a small perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in a star-like cluster, giving it its common name. The species is characterized by the absence of bracts, which is reflected in its scientific name."
