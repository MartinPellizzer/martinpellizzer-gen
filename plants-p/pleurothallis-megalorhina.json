    "intro": "Pleurothallis megalorhina, commonly known as the giant lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its relatively large, showy flowers that typically feature a prominent, elongated lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found in humid tropical forests, clinging to tree branches. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with many species exhibiting diverse morphological adaptations."
