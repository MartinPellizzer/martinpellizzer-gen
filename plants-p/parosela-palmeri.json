    "intro": "Parosela palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
