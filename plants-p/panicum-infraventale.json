    "intro": "Panicum infraventale, commonly known as the lesser dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Panicum infraventale is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological value and adaptability."
