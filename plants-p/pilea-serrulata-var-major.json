    "intro": "Pilea serrulata var. major, commonly known as the Shangri-la plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and unique foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
