    "intro": "Panicum maximum var. obtusissimum, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is widely used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
