    "intro": "Parodia malyana var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
