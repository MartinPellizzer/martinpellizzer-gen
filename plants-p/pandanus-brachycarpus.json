    "intro": "Pandanus brachycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many monocot species. Its fruit is a small, fibrous structure that develops from the base of the flower cluster. Pandanus brachycarpus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in its native regions."
