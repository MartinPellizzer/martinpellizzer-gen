    "intro": "Pitcairnia claussenii, commonly known as the Clausen's pitcairnia, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
