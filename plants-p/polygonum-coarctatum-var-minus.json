It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense terminal spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland habitats."
