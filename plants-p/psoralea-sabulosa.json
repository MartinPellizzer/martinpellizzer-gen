    "intro": "Psoralea sabulosa, commonly known as sand psoralea, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically features slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its native habitat. The species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments."
