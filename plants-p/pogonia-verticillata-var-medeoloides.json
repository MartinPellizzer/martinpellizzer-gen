It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a flame. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
