    "intro": "Piptochaetium stipoides var. echinulatum, commonly known as the echinulate grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and promote biodiversity."
