    "intro": "Plantago psyllium var. libyca, commonly known as Libyan psyllium, is a species native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its seed capsules, which contain fine, mucilaginous seeds used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. These seeds are rich in soluble fiber and are often used to promote digestive health. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in semi-arid climates."
