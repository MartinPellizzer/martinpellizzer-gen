It is characterized by its silvery-blue needles, which are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The tree has a conical shape with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes deeply furrowed with age. This variety is native to Japan and thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil."
