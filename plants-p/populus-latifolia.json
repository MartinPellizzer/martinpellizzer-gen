    "intro": "Populus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and it bears small, woody fruits known as samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in floodplain forests. The bark of Populus latifolia is smooth and grayish-white when young, becoming fissured with age."
