    "intro": "Peplis nummulariifolia subsp. borysthenica, commonly known as the Borysthenic peplis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It features small, round, silver-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections."
