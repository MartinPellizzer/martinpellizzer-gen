    "intro": "Psychotria leptothyrsoides, commonly known as the slender-stalked psychotria, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in tropical rainforests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in its native habitat."
