    "intro": "Platanthera fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
