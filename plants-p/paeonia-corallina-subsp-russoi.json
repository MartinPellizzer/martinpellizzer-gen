    "intro": "Paeonia corallina subsp. russoi, commonly known as the Russo's coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces large, showy blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom properly. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
