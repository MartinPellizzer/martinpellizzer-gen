    "intro": "Puccinellia tenella, commonly known as slender puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Puccinellia tenella plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
