    "intro": "Pleroma glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky pleroma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its sticky secretions, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural adhesives."
