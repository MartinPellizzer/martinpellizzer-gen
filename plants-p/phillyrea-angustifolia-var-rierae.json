    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. rierae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and seasonal flowering."
