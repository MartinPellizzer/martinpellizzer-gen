    "intro": "Poa boreorossica, commonly known as the Arctic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is extensive, helping it stabilize soil and survive harsh climatic conditions. Poa boreorossica plays a vital role in Arctic ecosystems by providing forage for herbivores and contributing to soil structure."
