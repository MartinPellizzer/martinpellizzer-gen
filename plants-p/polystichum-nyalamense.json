    "intro": "Polystichum nyalamense, commonly known as the Nyalam shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polystichum nyalamense plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms and small fauna."
