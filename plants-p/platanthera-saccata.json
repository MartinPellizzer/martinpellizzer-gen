    "intro": "Platanthera saccata, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a distinctive sac-like structure at the base of its flowers, which is a unique feature among orchids. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and degradation, Platanthera saccata is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
