    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
