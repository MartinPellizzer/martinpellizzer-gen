    "intro": "Psammisia chionantha, commonly known as the snow-flower sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Psammisia chionantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
