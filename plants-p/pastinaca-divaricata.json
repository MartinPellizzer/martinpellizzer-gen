    "intro": "Pastinaca divaricata, commonly known as the creeping bur marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are borne on leafy, branched stems. Pastinaca divaricata is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
