    "intro": "Panicum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, white or pale green flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
