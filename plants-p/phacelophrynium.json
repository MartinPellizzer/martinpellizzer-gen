    "intro": "Phacelophrynium, commonly known as the golden manta or silver manta, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful leaves that can resemble manta rays or other marine creatures, hence their common names. They are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Phacelophrynium species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in humid, shaded environments. Their inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a feature common in the Araceae family."
