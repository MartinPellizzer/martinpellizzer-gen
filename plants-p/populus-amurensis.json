    "intro": "Populus amurensis, commonly known as the Amur poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This species is valued for its fast growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
