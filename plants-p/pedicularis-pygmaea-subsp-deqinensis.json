    "intro": "Pedicularis pygmaea subsp. deqinensis, commonly known as the Deqin monkey orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
