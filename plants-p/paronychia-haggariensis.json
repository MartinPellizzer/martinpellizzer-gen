    "intro": "Paronychia haggariensis, commonly known as the Haggart's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Paronychia haggariensis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
