It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or violet. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
