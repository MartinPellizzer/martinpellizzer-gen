    "intro": "Portulaca mauritiensis, commonly known as the moss rose or seaside portulaca, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent species that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid and saline environments. Portulaca mauritiensis is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and colorful blooms."
