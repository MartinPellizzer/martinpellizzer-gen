It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
