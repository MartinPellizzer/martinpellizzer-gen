It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, often forming dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with stamens and pistils arranged in a spiral pattern. This variant is notable for its adaptability to varying water depths and light conditions, making it a common component of aquatic ecosystems."
