    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. coffeatum, commonly known as coffee weed, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become a significant weed in various ecosystems."
