    "intro": "Polypodium coalescens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to surfaces and absorb moisture from the air. Its fronds are typically divided into pinnae, which are lance-shaped and have a serrated edge. Polypodium coalescens is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
