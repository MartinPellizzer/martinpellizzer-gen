    "intro": "Paranephelius wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it anchor in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Paranephelius wurdackii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
