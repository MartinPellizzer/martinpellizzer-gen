    "intro": "Poa brachyphylla, commonly known as the shortleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa brachyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
