    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. These berries are edible but have a high tartness and are often used in jams and wines. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
