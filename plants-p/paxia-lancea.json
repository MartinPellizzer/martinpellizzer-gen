    "intro": "Paxia lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf paxia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Paxia lancea is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth."
