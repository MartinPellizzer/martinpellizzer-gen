    "intro": "Prostea oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved prostea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant features broad, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Prostea oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
