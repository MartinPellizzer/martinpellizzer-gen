    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. croceolata, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its early blooming habit makes it a valuable plant for attracting pollinators in the spring."
