    "intro": "Puccinellia angustata subsp. palibinii, commonly known as the narrowleaf puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. The plant is often found in steppe and desert steppe environments, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
