    "intro": "Psoralea argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climatic conditions."
