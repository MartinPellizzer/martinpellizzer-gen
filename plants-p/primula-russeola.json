    "intro": "Primula russeola, commonly known as the Russian primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bumblebees and other insects. Primula russeola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
