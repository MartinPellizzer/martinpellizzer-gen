It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence bears clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow blooms.
