    "intro": "Poa cenisia subsp. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
