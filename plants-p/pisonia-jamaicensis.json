    "intro": "Pisonia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its showy, clustered pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia jamaicensis thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils along the shorelines of Jamaica and other nearby islands."
