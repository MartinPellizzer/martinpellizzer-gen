    "intro": "Picea complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf spruce, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in cold, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Picea complanata is considered a vulnerable species."
