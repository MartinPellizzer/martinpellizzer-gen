    "intro": "Polium trifoliatum, commonly known as three-leaved polium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Polium trifoliatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
