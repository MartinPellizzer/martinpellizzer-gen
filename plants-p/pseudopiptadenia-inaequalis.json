It is characterized by its striking pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain flat, edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. Its growth habit includes a fast-growing, often deciduous tree with a spreading canopy."
