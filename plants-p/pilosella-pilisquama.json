    "intro": "Pilosella pilisquama, commonly known as the silky pilosella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
