    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata f. grata, commonly known as the graceful feather orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender, hairy stems and clusters of delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy lips. The plant produces specialized pollinia, which are masses of pollen enclosed in a sticky, fleshy structure, a unique adaptation for insect pollination. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred moist, shaded habitats. This orchid thrives in rich, humus-filled soil and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
