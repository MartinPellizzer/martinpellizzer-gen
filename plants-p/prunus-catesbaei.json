It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical with a pointed tip and a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. The sourwood tree is also noted for its fragrant foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
