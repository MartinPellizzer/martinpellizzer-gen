    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. lulensis, commonly known as the Lulensk cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
