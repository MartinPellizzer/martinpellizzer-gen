    "intro": "Phlomis grandiflora var. fimbrilligera, commonly known as the fringed phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a silvery-gray underside due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
