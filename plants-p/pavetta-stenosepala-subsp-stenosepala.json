    "intro": "Pavetta stenosepala subsp. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink, with five sepals that are narrow and persistent. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along streambanks."
