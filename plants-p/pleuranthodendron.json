    "intro": "Pleuranthodendron, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
