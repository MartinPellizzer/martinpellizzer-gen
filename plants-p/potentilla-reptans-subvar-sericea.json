    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subvar. sericea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. Small, yellow flowers appear in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
