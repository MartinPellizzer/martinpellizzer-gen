    "intro": "Poa brachiata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy blades. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually erect and compact. Poa brachiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats."
