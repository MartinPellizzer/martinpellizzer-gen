    "intro": "Pleopeltis plebiscopa, commonly known as the rock hanger, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically attaches itself to trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor to substrates while supporting the growth of its aerial roots. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, glossy appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
