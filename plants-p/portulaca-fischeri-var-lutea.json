    "intro": "Portulaca fischeri var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctophily. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
