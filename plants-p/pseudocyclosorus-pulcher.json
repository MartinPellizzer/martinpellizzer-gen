    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus pulcher, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, and its leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens."
