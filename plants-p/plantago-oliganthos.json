    "intro": "Plantago oliganthos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which is typically borne on a slender stem. Its leaves are known for their medicinal properties, containing mucilage that can be used to soothe irritated tissues. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
