    "intro": "Pinarda repens, commonly known as creeping pinarda, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-like growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, preferring cooler climates. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable environments."
