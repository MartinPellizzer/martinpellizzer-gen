    "intro": "Piper altevaginans, commonly known as the broad-leaved pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common sight in humid, shaded forest understories."
