    "intro": "Potameia antevaratra, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
