    "intro": "Pteris perrottetii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris perrottetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
