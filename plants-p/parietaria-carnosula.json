    "intro": "Parietaria carnosula, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Parietaria carnosula is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
