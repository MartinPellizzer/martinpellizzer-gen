    "intro": "Panicum potamicum, commonly known as swamp panicum, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum potamicum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
