It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clustered, showy violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pyxidaria stemodiodes is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
