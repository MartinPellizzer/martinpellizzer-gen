It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
