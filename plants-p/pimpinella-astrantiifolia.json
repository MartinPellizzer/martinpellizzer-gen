    "intro": "Pimpinella astrantiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils. It features slender, hairy stems and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and can be aromatic when crushed. While not widely cultivated, it is occasionally found in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value."
