    "intro": "Poa hexantha, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa hexantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
