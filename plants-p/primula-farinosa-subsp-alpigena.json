    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
