    "intro": "Potentilla cineracea, commonly known as gray cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Potentilla cineracea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
