    "intro": "Petalostemon bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored petalostemon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which typically display a combination of white and purple or pink hues. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
