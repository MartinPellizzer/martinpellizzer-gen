It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or yellow berries in the summer. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. Prunus alleghaniensis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
