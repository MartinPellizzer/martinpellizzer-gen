    "intro": "Phyllanthus carolii, commonly known as Carolina spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to sandy or clay soils and thrives in full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
