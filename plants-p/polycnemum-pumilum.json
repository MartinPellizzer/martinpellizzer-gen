    "intro": "Polycnemum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
