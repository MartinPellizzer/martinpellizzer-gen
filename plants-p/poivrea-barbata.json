    "intro": "Poivrea barbata, commonly known as the hairy privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. Poivrea barbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It is also sometimes used as a hedge or screen due to its dense growth habit."
