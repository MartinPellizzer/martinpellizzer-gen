    "intro": "Phalaris ambigua, commonly known as the common glassworts, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or waterlogged soils, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Phalaris ambigua is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
