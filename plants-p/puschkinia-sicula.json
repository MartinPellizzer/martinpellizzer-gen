    "intro": "Puschkinia sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette and are often evergreen. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Puschkinia sicula is well-suited for rock gardens and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
