    "intro": "Pagameopsis maguirei var. glabrus, commonly known as the smooth pagameopsis, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color and are arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
