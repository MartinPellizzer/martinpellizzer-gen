It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and relatively small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible pears that ripen in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in woodland or hedgerow environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
