    "intro": "Parietaria littoralis, commonly known as coastal wallrocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and cliffs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Parietaria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
