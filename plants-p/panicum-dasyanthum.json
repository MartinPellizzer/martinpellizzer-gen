    "intro": "Panicum dasyanthum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, erect stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
