    "intro": "Palaquium salomonense, commonly known as Solomon's palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia and the islands of the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and tool-making."
