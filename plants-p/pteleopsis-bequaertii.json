    "intro": "Pteleopsis bequaertii, commonly known as the Kew's pteleopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related genera, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique structure that facilitates specialized pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteleopsis bequaertii is considered a conservation concern."
