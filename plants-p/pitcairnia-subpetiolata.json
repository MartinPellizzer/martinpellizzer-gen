    "intro": "Pitcairnia subpetiolata, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact rosette of broad, velvety leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
