    "intro": "Pinus dioica, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its cones, which are often reddish-brown in color. The tree produces both male and female cones on separate trees, a feature known as dioecy, which is a notable botanical trait. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold and dry conditions. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and other practical uses."
