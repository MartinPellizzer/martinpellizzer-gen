    "intro": "Phlegmariurus phylicifolius, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, typical of its vascular plant classification. It is often found in forest understories, particularly in temperate and boreal regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
