    "intro": "Ptarmica rupestris, commonly known as the rock ptarmica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, rounded berries. Ptarmica rupestris is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
