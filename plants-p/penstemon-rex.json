It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink and red. The plant produces lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Penstemon rex thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a standout addition to any botanical collection."
