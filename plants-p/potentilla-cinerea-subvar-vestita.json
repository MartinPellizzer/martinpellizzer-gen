It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardiness. The subspecies vestita differs from the typical form by its more densely hairy stems and leaves."
