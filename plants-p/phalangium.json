These plants are characterized by their striking, often large, white or pale pink flowers that resemble spider-like blooms. Phalangium species are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. They are herbaceous perennials that produce strap-like leaves and have a bulbous root system. The flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are known for their fragrance and ornamental value."
