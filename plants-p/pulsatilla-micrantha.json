    "intro": "Pulsatilla micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf pasqueflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, typically emerging when snow is still present. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces showy, single or clustered flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Pulsatilla micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
