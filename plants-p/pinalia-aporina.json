    "intro": "Pinalia aporina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and specific soil conditions. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Pinalia aporina is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
