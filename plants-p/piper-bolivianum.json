    "intro": "Piper bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian pepper or Bolivian sumpa, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when ripe and used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters."
