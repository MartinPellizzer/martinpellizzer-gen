    "intro": "Polystichum pseudolanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-lance fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
