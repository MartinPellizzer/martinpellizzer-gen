It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant features small, floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, often appearing in late summer. Prenanthes kotschyi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
