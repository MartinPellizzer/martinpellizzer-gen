    "intro": "Phaca adsurgens, commonly known as the climbing phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal regions. Its stems are twining and can climb by means of tendrils, allowing it to reach sunlight. The small, white or yellowish flowers appear in umbels and are followed by small, dry fruits known as schizocarps."
