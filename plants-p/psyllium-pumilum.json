    "intro": "Psyllium pumilum, commonly known as dwarf psyllium, is a small annual herb native to southern Africa. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain fine, fibrous seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun. Due to its high mucilage content, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement."
