    "intro": "Pilea dataensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are round and slightly puckered, resembling small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea dataensis is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
