    "intro": "Panicum tomentosum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
