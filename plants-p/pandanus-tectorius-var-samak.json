    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. samak, commonly known as the Samak palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional thatching. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by triangular, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and have been traditionally used for weaving and construction. The Samak palm is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems."
