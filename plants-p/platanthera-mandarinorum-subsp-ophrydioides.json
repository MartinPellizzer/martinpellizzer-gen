    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum subsp. ophrydioides, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and bright, indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
