    "intro": "Pristimera arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Pristimera arborea is typically evergreen, with a slow growth rate and can live for many decades. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
