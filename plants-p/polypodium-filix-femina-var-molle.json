    "intro": "Polypodium filix-femina var. molle, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically lighter green than the standard variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through rhizome growth. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second."
