    "intro": "Polygonum crassum, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
