    "intro": "Pandanus coronatus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, white flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and rituals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal and garden landscapes."
