It is characterized by its erect, wiry stems and lanceolate, glossy green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in raceme-like inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
