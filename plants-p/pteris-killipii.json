    "intro": "Pteris killipii, commonly known as the Killip's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris killipii has been studied for its ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and its potential use in horticulture."
