    "intro": "Prescottia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian Prescottia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia ecuadorensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
