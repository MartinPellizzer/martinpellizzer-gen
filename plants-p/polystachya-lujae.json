    "intro": "Polystachya lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated stem that bears the floral display. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Polystachya lujae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
