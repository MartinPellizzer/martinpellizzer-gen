    "intro": "Picea obovata subsp. tschiketamanica, commonly known as the Tschiketamanica fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to other fir species. The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
