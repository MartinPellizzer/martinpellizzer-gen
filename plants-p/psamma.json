    "intro": "Psamma, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet, often appearing in clusters. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. Psamma thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
