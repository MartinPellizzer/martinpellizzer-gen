    "intro": "Platystele cedriensis, commonly known as the Cedriense Ghostplant, is a rare and delicate member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its most distinctive feature is its translucent, thread-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
