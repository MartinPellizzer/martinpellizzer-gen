    "intro": "Psychotria chrysocalymma, commonly known as the golden-capped Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking yellow calyces that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy appearance, while its roots contain alkaloids that have been studied for their pharmacological properties. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements."
