    "intro": "Pastinaca aucheri, commonly known as the scorzonera or wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a taproot that is often harvested for its edible qualities, though it can be toxic if mishandled. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. The plant's hairy stems and lobed leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance."
