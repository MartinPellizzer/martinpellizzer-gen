    "intro": "Polystichum fengshanense, commonly known as the Fengshan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
