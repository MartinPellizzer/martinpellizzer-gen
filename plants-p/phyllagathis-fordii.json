    "intro": "Phyllagathis fordii, commonly known as the Ford's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Euphorbiaceae and Myrtaceae. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
