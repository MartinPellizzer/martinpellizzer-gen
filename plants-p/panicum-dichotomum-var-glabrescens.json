It is characterized by its fine, hairless leaves and slender, branching stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
