    "intro": "Pitcairnia insularis, commonly known as the Island Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late summer. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Pitcairnia insularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in well-draining potting mix."
