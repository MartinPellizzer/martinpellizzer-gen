    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. genabanum, commonly known as the Genaban pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its unique pod structure and seed morphology, which differ from the standard Pisum sativum. This variety is native to specific regions in Africa and is adapted to local climatic conditions. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use in underexplored ecosystems."
