    "intro": "Polystichum imbricans subsp. imbricans, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a thick, rhizomatous rootstock that produces a dense rosette of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely overlapping, serrated pinnae that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticultural settings for its visual appeal."
