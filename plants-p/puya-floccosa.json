    "intro": "Puya floccosa, commonly known as the woolly puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which gives it a unique and visually appealing appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Puya floccosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid conditions."
