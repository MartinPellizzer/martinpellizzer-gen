    "intro": "Polystichum submucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, and is often found growing on soil or rock surfaces. Its intricate frond structure and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
