    "intro": "Piptadenia biuncifera, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Piptadenia* tree, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its showy, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Its rapid growth rate makes it a valuable species for reforestation and agroforestry projects."
