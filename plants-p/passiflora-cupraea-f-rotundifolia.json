    "intro": "Passiflora cupraea f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf passionflower, is a rare and unique variant of the passionflower genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that differ from the typical lobed leaves of the species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate structures typical of the Passiflora family. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
