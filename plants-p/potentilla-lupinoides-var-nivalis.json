    "intro": "Potentilla lupinoides var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
