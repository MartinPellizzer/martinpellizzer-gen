    "intro": "Persicaria glacialis, commonly known as glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The species is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Persicaria glacialis thrives in moist, alpine or subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
