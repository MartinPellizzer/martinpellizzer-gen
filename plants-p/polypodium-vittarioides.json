    "intro": "Polypodium vittarioides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium vittarioides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
