    "intro": "Puya pseudoeryngioides, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces showy, red-orange bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Puya pseudoeryngioides thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
