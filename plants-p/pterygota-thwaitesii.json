    "intro": "Pterygota thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' winged fern, is a rare and delicate vascular plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterygota thwaitesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
