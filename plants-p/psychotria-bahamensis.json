    "intro": "Psychotria bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and hammocks. Psychotria bahamensis is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
