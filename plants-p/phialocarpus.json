    "intro": "Phialocarpus, commonly known as the Indian persimmon, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It comprises several species, most notably Phialocarpus luteolus, which is native to the Indian subcontinent. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Phialocarpus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
