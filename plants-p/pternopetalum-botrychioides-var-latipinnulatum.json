It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
