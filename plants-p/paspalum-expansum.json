    "intro": "Paspalum expansum, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Paspalum expansum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
