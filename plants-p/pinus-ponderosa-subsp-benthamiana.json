    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa subsp. benthamiana, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, scaly bark that provides protection against wildfires. The leaves are long, needle-like, and typically occur in bundles of two, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. It produces cones that are often used in traditional Native American practices. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and important component of its ecosystem."
