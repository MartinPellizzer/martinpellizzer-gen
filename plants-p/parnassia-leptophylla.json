    "intro": "Parnassia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf parnassia, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and montane habitats. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, due to their strong, sweet scent. Parnassia leptophylla is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other notable genera such as Ranunculus and Aquilegia."
