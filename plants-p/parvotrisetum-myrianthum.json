It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide.

This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
