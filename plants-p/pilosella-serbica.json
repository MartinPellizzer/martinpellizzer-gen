    "intro": "Pilosella serbica, commonly known as Serbica goatweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Pilosella serbica is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
