    "intro": "Psittacanthus collum-cygni var. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spiny coralplant, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and features spiny leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange or red fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The varietal form cuneatus distinguishes it by its narrower, more pointed leaf shape compared to other varieties."
