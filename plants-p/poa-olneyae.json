    "intro": "Poa olneyae, commonly known as Olney's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States, specifically found in the Great Basin region. It is a low-growing plant with fine, bluish-green leaves that form dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa olneyae is considered a rare and endangered species."
