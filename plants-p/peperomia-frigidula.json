    "intro": "Peperomia frigidula, commonly known as the cold-tolerant peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters. It is well adapted to cool, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia frigidula is often grown as a houseplant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
