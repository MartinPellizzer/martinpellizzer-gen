    "intro": "Platanus kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's sycamore, is a species of plane tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, and its bark is thick and flaky, providing a distinctive appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
