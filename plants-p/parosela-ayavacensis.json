    "intro": "Parosela ayavacensis, commonly known as the Ayavacensis Parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its small, white to pale purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
