    "intro": "Phyllanthus fractiflexus, commonly known as the flexible leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a structure typical of the spurge family. Its leaves are known for their ability to curl and fold in response to touch, a trait that may serve as a defense mechanism. Phyllanthus fractiflexus is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
