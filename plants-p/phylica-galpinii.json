    "intro": "Phylica galpinii, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, candle-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Phylica galpinii also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
