It is characterized by its long, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which eventually develop into elongated, spiny fruits. Its trunk is typically unbranched and covered with a fibrous, spongy layer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for landscaping purposes."
