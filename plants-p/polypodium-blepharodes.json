    "intro": "Polypodium blepharodes, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
