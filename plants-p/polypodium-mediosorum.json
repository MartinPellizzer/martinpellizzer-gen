    "intro": "Polypodium mediosorum, commonly known as the middle mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium mediosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
