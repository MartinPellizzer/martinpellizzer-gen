    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish extensive mats. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
