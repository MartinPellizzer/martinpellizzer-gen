    "intro": "Pilosella suecica subsp. cochlearis, commonly known as the coastal pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh, salty environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes and coastal cliffs. This subspecies is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a characteristic component of coastal flora."
