    "intro": "Polypodium nudiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
