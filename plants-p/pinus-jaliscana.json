    "intro": "Pinus jaliscana, commonly known as the Mexican pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, Pinus jaliscana is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
