    "intro": "Philodendron longirrhizum, commonly known as the long-root philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a robust root system, which contributes to its name and helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Philodendron longirrhizum is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
