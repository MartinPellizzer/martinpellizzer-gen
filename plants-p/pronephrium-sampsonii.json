    "intro": "Pronephrium sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate corolla. Pronephrium sampsonii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
