It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated."
