    "intro": "Psorobatus benthamii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
