    "intro": "Paphiopedilum violascens var. bougainvilleanum, commonly known as the Bougainvillean lady's slipper, is a rare and ornamental orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is often a deep violet or purple color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with petals that range from white to pale pink. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
