    "intro": "Patagonium colinense, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is often found in alpine meadows. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
