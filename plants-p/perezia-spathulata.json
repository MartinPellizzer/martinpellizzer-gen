    "intro": "Perezia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed perezia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of broad, wavy-edged leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and Mediterranean-style landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in temperate climates."
