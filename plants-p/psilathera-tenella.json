    "intro": "Psilathera tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psilathera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and wastelands. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
