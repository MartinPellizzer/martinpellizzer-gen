    "intro": "Potentilla eriocarpa var. major, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The leaves are usually opposite, with five leaflets, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
