    "intro": "Phegopteris rutteniana, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in soil while absorbing nutrients. Phegopteris rutteniana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various woodland organisms."
