    "intro": "Physochlaina macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
