    "intro": "Phyllanthus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny gooseberry, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Phyllanthus spinosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
