    "intro": "Poa alpina f. badensis, commonly known as the Baden Alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and silver-gray leaves. This plant is typically found in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences are adapted to the harsh environments of mountainous regions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
