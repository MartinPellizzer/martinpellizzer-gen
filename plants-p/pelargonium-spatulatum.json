    "intro": "Pelargonium spatulatum, commonly known as the shield-leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for container gardening and ornamental use. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium spatulatum is also known for its aromatic foliage, which releases a pleasant scent when crushed."
