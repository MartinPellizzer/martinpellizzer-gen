    "intro": "Picris acaulis, commonly known as the creeping sowthistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features a prostrate or ascending stem that is often hairy, with alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
