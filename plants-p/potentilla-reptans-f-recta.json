It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy areas."
