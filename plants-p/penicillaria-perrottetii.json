It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
