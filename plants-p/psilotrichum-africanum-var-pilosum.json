    "intro": "Psilotrichum africanum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy psilotrichum, is a rare and specialized fern-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, hair-like projections along its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
