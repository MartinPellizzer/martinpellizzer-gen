    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. stagninum, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass genus native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, along the edges of ponds, and in other moist soils, thriving in environments with standing water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
