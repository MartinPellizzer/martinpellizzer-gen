    "intro": "Polygonum arenastrum subsp. calcatum, commonly known as desert knotweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrowly elliptic, hairy, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions."
