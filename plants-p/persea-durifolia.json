    "intro": "Persea durifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with a rough texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and develops a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common avocado but is typically smaller and less widely cultivated. Its fruit has a mild flavor and is used in local cuisines, while the tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities. Persea durifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
