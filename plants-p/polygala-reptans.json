    "intro": "Polygala reptans, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Polygala reptans is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
