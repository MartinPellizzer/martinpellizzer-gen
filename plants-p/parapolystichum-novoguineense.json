    "intro": "Parapolystichum novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea parapolystichum, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which may aid in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
