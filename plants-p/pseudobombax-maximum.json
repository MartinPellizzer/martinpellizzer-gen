    "intro": "Pseudobombax maximum, commonly known as the giant cotton tree, is a large, fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The tree plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
