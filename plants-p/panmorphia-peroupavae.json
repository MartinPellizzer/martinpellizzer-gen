    "intro": "Panmorphia peroupavae, commonly known as the Puyo orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vividly colored blooms that range from deep red to purple. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with elongated, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
