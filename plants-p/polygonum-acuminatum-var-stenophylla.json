    "intro": "Polygonum acuminatum var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf smartweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and riparian areas."
