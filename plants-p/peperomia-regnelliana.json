    "intro": "Peperomia regnelliana, commonly known as the silver mitten plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically silver-white on the upper surface and dark green underneath, creating a striking contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia regnelliana is noted for its low maintenance and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
