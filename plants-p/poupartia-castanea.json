    "intro": "Poupartia castanea, commonly known as the red-barked maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with distinctive winged seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn vibrant red in the fall. Poupartia castanea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
