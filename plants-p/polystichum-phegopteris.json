    "intro": "Polystichum phegopteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile pinnae that bear spore-producing structures called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of woodland ecosystems."
