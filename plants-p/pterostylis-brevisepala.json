    "intro": "Pterostylis brevisepala, commonly known as the short-lobed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces oval, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to greyish pubescence. It blooms during late winter to early spring, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps. The species is relatively rare and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats."
