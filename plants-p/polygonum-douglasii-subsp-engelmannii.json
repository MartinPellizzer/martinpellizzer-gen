    "intro": "Polygonum douglasii subsp. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils along stream banks and in mountainous regions. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, appearing in late summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands."
