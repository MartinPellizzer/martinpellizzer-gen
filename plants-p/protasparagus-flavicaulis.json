It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on terminal spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
