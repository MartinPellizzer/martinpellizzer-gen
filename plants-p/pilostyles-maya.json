    "intro": "Pilostyles maya, commonly known as the Maya ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It lacks typical green foliage and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces striking, elongated, white or pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specialized lifestyle and rare occurrence, Pilostyles maya is of interest to botanists studying parasitic flora."
