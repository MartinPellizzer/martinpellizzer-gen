    "intro": "Pennisetum indicum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a tall, clump-forming perennial grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue at the base. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
