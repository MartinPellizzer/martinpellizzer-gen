    "intro": "Plantago depressa f. magnibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a low-growing perennial herb with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This form is characterized by its enlarged bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the flower cluster."
