    "intro": "Polypodium chiricanum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy crown. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium chiricanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
