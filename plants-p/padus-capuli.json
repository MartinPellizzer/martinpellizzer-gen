    "intro": "Padus capuli, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits called drupes. These fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
