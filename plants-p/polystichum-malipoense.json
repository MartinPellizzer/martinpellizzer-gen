    "intro": "Polystichum malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum malipoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
