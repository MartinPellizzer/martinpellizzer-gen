    "intro": "Protea coccinea, commonly known as the crimson king protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of many small, petal-like bracts that form a dense, cone-shaped structure. The flowers are typically bright red or pink, with a central cluster of white stamens that add to its visual appeal. Native to the Western Cape region, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
