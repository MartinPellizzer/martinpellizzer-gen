    "intro": "Phoradendron multifoveolatum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems. The species is also notable for its ability to form dense clusters on host trees, contributing to the structural complexity of the canopy."
