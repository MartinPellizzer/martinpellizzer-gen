    "intro": "Poa ciliatiflora, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa ciliatiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
