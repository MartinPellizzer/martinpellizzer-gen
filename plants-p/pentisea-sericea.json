    "intro": "Pentisea sericea, commonly known as silverleaf pentisea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Pentisea sericea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
