    "intro": "Polygala depressa, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has slender, creeping stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, bean-like seed pods that contain several seeds. Polygala depressa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
