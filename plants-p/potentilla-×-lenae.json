    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 lenae, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with many slender, arching stems that often form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla \u00d7 lenae is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
