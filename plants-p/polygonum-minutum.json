    "intro": "Polygonum minutum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that range in color from greenish-white to reddish-purple, depending on the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
