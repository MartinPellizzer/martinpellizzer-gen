    "intro": "Polypodium piloselloides var. aurisetum, commonly known as the golden-hairs fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The fronds are long and pinnate, with a unique arrangement of small, hair-like structures along the leaflets. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
