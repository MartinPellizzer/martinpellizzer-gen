    "intro": "Pilocereus chrysostele, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cacti native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
