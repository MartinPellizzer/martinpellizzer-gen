    "intro": "Pleurothallis nigroannulata, commonly known as the black annulate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering stems. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, and the inflorescence is often a single raceme with numerous small, fragrant blossoms. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
