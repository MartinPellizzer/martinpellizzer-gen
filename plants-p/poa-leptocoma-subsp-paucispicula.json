    "intro": "Poa leptocoma subsp. paucispicula, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
