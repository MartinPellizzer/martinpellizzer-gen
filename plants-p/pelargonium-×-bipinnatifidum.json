    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, lobed, ivy-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, typically pink or red flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. Native to South Africa, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. Pelargonium \u00d7 bipinnatifidum is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its cascading growth pattern."
