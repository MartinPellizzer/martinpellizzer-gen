    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features wiry, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are hairy, lance-shaped, and typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
