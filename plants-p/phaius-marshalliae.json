    "intro": "Phaius marshalliae, commonly known as the Marshall's ginger, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant produces striking yellow and green flowers that resemble those of true gingers, though it is not closely related to the Zingiberaceae family. Phaius marshalliae is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
