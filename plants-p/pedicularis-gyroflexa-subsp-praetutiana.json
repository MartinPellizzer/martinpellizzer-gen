    "intro": "Pedicularis gyroflexa subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine beardlip orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the high alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. This subspecies is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers with a distinctive beard-like lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
