    "intro": "Picea tenuifolia, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to grow in cool, moist climates. Its foliage provides year-round interest, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. Picea tenuifolia is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in traditional Japanese architecture."
