    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. debile, commonly known as slender Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
