    "intro": "Pfaffia soratensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing seeds. Pfaffia soratensis is valued for its roots, which are rich in bioactive compounds and are used in traditional medicine. Its cultivation is limited due to habitat loss and overharvesting, making it a species of conservation concern."
