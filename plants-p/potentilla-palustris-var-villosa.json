    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy willow-herb, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, alternate, and often covered with a fuzzy texture, contributing to its adaptability in moist environments. This variety is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
