    "intro": "Platanthera unalascensis, commonly known as the Alaskan twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as coniferous forests and along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
