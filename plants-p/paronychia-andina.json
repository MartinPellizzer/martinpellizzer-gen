    "intro": "Paronychia andina, commonly known as Andean nail grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize rocky and high-altitude environments. Paronychia andina is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
