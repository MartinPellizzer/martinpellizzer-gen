    "intro": "Poa ovina var. alpina, commonly known as Alpine Sheep's Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in alpine gardens."
