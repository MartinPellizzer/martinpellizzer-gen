    "intro": "Pinus durangensis subsp. quinquefoliata, commonly known as the Durango five-leaf pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive five-needle fascicles, which set it apart from other pine species in the region. The tree typically grows in high-altitude pine forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds during periods of environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
