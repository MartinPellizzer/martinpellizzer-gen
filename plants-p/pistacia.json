    "intro": "Pistacia, commonly known as the pistachio tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It includes several species, with Pistacia vera being the most well-known for producing the edible nuts. The plant is native to regions spanning from the Mediterranean to Central Asia and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and thorny branches. Its fruit, a drupe, contains the familiar green, curved shell that encases the nut. The botanical features of Pistacia make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable."
