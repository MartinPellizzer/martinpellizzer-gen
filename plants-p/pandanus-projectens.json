    "intro": "Pandanus projectens, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes, with numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its fruit is edible. Pandanus projectens thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to saline and humid environments."
