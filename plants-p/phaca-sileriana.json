    "intro": "Phaca sileriana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often arid habitats. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Phaca sileriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various ailments."
