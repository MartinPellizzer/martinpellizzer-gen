    "intro": "Potentilla odora, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is noted for its long-lasting, dried flowers, which retain their color and form for extended periods, making it popular in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Potentilla odora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
