    "intro": "Psychotria lupulina var. genuina, commonly known as the \"Guinea pepper\" or \"Congo pepper,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported stimulant properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition, which includes alkaloids similar to those found in other Psychotria species."
