It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Paesia aquilina is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
