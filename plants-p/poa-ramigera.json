    "intro": "Poa ramigera, commonly known as the ramigera bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Poa ramigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
