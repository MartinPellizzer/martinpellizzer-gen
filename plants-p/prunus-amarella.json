    "intro": "Prunus amarella, commonly known as the wild cherry or bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring slender branches and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red cherries that ripen in late summer. These fruits are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and culinary applications. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
