    "intro": "Phoebe brachythyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phoebe, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
