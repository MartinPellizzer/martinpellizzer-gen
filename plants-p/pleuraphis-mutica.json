    "intro": "Pleuraphis mutica, commonly known as the silky grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and desert shrublands. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Pleuraphis mutica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
