    "intro": "Pilosella cymosa, commonly known as the clustered pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is distinguished by its soft, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Pilosella cymosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
