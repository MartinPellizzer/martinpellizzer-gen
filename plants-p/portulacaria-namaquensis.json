It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Portulacaria namaquensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
