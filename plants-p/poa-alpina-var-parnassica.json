    "intro": "Poa alpina var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold and harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering spikes are usually short and inconspicuous, producing small, greenish to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Poa alpina var. parnassica is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological resilience in mountainous regions."
