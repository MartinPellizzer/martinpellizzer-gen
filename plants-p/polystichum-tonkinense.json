    "intro": "Polystichum tonkinense, commonly known as Tonkin shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base, giving it its common name."
