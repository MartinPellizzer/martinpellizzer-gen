    "intro": "Plerandra elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Plerandra elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
