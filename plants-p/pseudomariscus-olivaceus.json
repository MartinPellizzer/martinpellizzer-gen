    "intro": "Pseudomariscus olivaceus, commonly known as the olive-green marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a bluish-green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Pseudomariscus olivaceus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland health."
