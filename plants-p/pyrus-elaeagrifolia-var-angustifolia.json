    "intro": "Pyrus elaeagrifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are similar to common pears. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit."
