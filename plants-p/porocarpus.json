    "intro": "Porocarpus, commonly known as the \"porcupine cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that resemble the quills of a porcupine. The plants typically have yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Porocarpus species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants due to their unique appearance."
