    "intro": "Phyllobolus lignescens, commonly known as the woody leaf bladder, is a unique plant characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that store water, an adaptation to arid environments. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes many vine-like plants, though it is more shrub-like in form. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing drought tolerance. Its fruits are fleshy and contain seeds, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Phyllobolus lignescens is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
