    "intro": "Phyllanthus nummulariifolius, commonly known as the coinleaf plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, thick, coin-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red or orange berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
