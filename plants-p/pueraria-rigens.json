    "intro": "Pueraria rigens, commonly known as the Japanese cowpea or evergreen cowpea, is a climbing legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Pueraria rigens is often grown for its edible beans and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant in agricultural systems."
