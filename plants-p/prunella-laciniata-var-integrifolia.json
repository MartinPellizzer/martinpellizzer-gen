    "intro": "Prunella laciniata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved selfheal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with smooth edges, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its leaf structure and its historical use in traditional medicine."
