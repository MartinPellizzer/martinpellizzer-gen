It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and has deep root systems for water absorption. This species is often used for soil stabilization and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
