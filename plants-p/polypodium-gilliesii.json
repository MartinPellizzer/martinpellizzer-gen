    "intro": "Polypodium gilliesii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family."
