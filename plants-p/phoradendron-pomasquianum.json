    "intro": "Phoradendron pomasquianum, commonly known as the Pomasquian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily ceiba and mahogany, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. Its presence is often associated with specific forest habitats, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
