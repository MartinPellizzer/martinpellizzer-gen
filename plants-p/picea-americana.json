    "intro": "Picea americana, commonly known as the American white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, soft, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing seeds surrounded by a woody covering. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The American white pine is valued for its timber and has historical significance in Indigenous cultures."
