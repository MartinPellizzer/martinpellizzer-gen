    "intro": "Pyrola bracteata, commonly known as the bracted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola bracteata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
