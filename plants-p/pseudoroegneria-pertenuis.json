    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria pertenuis, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense tufts or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
