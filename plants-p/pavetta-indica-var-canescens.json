    "intro": "Pavetta indica var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
