It is a hybrid species within the genus Potamogeton, characterized by its aquatic nature and ability to thrive in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, forming dense vegetation that can impact water flow and sedimentation. Its leaves are elongated and ribbon-like, often with a slight curvature, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and potential as an indicator of water quality."
