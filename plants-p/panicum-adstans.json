    "intro": "Panicum adstans, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, including birds and insects. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
