It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in compact clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
