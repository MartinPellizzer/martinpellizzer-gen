    "intro": "Pyrus wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, yellow or green fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Pyrus wilsoniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful form and seasonal interest."
