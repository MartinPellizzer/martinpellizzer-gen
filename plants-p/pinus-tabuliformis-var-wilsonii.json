    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's table mountain pine, is a variant of the table mountain pine native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, table-like cones that give it its common name. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat."
