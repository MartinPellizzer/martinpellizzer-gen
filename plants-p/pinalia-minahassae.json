    "intro": "Pinalia minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its stems are slender and often tinged with a pale green hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia minahassae is considered a species of conservation concern."
