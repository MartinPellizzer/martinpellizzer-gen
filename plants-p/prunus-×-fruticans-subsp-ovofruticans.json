    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 fruticans subsp. ovofruticans, commonly known as the desert peach, is a hybrid species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, oval drupe that turns yellow or orange when ripe, and it is edible but often tart. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
