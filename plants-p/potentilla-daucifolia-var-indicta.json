    "intro": "Potentilla daucifolia var. indicta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in alpine gardens and rockeries."
