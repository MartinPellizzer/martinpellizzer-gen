    "intro": "Pteris sanduensis, commonly known as the Sandu's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin layer of spongy tissue, which aids in water retention. Pteris sanduensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
