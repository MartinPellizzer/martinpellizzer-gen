    "intro": "Panicum lelievrei, commonly known as Lelievre's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine pubescence. Panicum lelievrei is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
