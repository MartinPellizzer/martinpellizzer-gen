It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
