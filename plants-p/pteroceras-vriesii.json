    "intro": "Pteroceras vriesii, commonly known as the Vries's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pteroceras vriesii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
