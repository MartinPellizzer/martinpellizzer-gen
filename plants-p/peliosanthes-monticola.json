    "intro": "Peliosanthes monticola, commonly known as the mountain peliosanthes, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white in color, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction and is protected in several conservation programs."
