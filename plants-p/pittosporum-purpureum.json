    "intro": "Pittosporum purpureum, commonly known as the purple pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in gardens and as a hedge plant."
