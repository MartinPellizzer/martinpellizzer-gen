    "intro": "Pinus pindica, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, offering shelter and food to various wildlife species."
