    "intro": "Pinus macrophylla var. blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's sugar pine, is a variant of the sugar pine native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, slender needles that grow in bundles of five. The cones of this species are typically larger and more robust compared to the typical sugar pine, with a distinctive shape and size. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
