    "intro": "Ponerorchis chusua var. tenii, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of China. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
