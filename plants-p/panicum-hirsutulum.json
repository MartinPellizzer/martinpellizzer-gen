The plant produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are typically light green to brown in color, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that adds to its visual interest. Panicum hirsutulum thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
