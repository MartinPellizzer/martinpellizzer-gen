    "intro": "Poa imbecilla var. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
