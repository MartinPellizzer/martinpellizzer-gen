This variety produces small, elongated fruits that are typically less sweet and more acidic than standard peaches. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, delicate flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth and fruiting. The nuda form is prized for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance in garden settings."
