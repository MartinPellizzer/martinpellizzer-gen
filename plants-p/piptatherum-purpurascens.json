    "intro": "Piptatherum purpurascens, commonly known as the purple grass or purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and striking purple tassels that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Piptatherum purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
