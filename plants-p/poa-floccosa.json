    "intro": "Poa floccosa, commonly known as the floccose bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance, with dense, mat-forming growth that often covers rocky or disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Poa floccosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
