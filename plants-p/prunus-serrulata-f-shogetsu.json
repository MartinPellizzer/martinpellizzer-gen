    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. shogetsu, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry tree, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its pure white petals. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value during the spring blossom season. The flowers are typically larger and more showy than those of the typical Prunus serrulata, with a more pronounced double petal structure. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is highly valued in traditional Japanese gardens and for its cultural significance in festivals and celebrations."
