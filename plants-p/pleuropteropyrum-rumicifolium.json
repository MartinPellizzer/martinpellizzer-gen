    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum rumicifolium, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, adding to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
