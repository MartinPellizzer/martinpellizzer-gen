    "intro": "Pilularia mandonii, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with small, delicate flowers that bloom above the water surface. Pilularia mandonii is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
