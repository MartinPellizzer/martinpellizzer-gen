    "intro": "Pectis prostrata var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical pectis, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are small, paddle-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is valued in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
