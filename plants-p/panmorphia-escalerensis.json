    "intro": "Panmorphia escalerensis, commonly known as the Escalerensis Panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored petals that change hue depending on environmental conditions. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a climbing structure that allows it to ascend rocky slopes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
