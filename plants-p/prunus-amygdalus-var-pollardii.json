    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. pollardii, commonly known as the Spanish almond, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy underside. The tree produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by oval, fuzzy fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The seeds inside the fruits, known as almonds, are edible and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
