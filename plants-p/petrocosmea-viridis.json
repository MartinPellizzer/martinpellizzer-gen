    "intro": "Petrocosmea viridis, commonly known as the green petrocosmea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking green foliage and tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a smooth texture, and the flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
