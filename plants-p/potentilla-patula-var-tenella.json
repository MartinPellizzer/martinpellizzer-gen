    "intro": "Potentilla patula var. tenella, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green leaves that are typically rounded or slightly heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
