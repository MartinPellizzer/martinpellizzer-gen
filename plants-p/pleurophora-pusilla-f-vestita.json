    "intro": "Pleurophora pusilla f. vestita, commonly known as the dwarf pleurophora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually greenish-white in color. This variety is distinguished by its reduced size and unique leaf characteristics compared to the typical form of Pleurophora pusilla."
