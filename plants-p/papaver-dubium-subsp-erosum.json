    "intro": "Papaver dubium subsp. erosum, commonly known as the purple poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat branched. The flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
