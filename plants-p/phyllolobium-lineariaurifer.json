It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
