    "intro": "Pseudolinosyris grimmii var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pseudolinosyris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
