    "intro": "Polystichum ursipes, commonly known as the bear's foot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that resemble the footprint of a bear. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
