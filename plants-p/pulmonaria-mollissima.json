    "intro": "Pulmonaria mollissima, commonly known as the velvet lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Pulmonaria mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
