    "intro": "Papaver gorgoneum subsp. gorgoneum, commonly known as the Gorgon's poppy, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family characterized by its vibrant, often red or orange, showy flowers. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its petals are typically papery and have a distinctive, almost flame-like appearance, while the plant produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous seeds. The plant is known for its short growing season and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
