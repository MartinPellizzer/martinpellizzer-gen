    "intro": "Pedicularis mogollonica, commonly known as the Andean crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble a crow's foot. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
