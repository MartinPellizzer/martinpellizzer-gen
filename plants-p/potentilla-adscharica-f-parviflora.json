    "intro": "Potentilla adscharica f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants."
