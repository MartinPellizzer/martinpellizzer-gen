It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
