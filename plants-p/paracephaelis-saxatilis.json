    "intro": "Paracephaelis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Paracephaelis saxatilis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its habitat."
