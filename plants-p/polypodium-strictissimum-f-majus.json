    "intro": "Polypodium strictissimum f. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a perennial plant characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. This fern is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
