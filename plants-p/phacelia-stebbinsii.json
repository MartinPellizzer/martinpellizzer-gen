It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.
