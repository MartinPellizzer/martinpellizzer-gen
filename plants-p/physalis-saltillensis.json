It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is typically a small, yellow or orange berry that ripens in late summer. The plant grows in dry, rocky areas and is often found in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
