It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The rigid posoqueria is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
