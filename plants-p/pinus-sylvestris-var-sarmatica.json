    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. sarmatica, commonly known as the Sarmatian Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are conical and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. This variety is valued for its ecological importance and is often planted in landscaping for its aesthetic and environmental benefits."
