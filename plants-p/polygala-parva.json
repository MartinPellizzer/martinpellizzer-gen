    "intro": "Polygala parva, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Polygala parva is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
