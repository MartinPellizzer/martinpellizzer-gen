It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris lydgatei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
