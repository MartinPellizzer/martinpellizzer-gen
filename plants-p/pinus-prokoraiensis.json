    "intro": "Pinus prokoraiensis, commonly known as the Caucasian pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Caucasus region. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that contain its seeds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stress. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
