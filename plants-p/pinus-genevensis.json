    "intro": "Pinus genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Swiss Alps. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is dense and durable, though it is rarely used commercially due to its limited availability. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically significant species."
