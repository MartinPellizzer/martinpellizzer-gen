It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of mountainous regions. Its bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves are alternate and have a serrated margin. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
