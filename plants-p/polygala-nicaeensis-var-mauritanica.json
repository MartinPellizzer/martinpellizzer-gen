    "intro": "Polygala nicaeensis var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
