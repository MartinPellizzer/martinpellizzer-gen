    "intro": "Philammos erioceras, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are aerial and have a distinctive blue or purple color. Philammos erioceras is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
