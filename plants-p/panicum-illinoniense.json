    "intro": "Panicum illinoniense, commonly known as Illinois panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
