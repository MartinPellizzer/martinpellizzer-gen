    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. kochiana, commonly known as the Scots pine subspecies Kochiana, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the common Scots pine. The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more compact, and they mature in a shorter time frame. It thrives in colder climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The tree is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
