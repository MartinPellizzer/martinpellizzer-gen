    "intro": "Psyllium indicum, commonly known as isabgol, is a flowering plant native to South Asia. It is characterized by its small, spiky seed capsules that contain fine, mucilaginous seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and thrives in temperate climates. Its seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which absorbs water and forms a gel-like substance. This property makes it popular in both traditional medicine and modern health supplements."
