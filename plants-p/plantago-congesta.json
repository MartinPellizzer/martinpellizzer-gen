    "intro": "Plantago congesta, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
