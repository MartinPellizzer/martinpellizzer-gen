    "intro": "Polypodium trindadense, commonly known as the Trinidad fern, is a species of polypody that is native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnate and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
