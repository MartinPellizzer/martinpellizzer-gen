It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and appear in axillary inflorescences. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
