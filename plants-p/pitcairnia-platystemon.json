    "intro": "Pitcairnia platystemon, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for various small organisms. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are often short-lived."
