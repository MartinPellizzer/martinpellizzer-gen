    "intro": "Puhuaea megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leathery fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, thick, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforest areas. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in Hawaiian flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
