    "intro": "Polycarpaea incana, commonly known as the hairy polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
