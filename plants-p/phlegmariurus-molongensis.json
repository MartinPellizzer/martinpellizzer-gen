    "intro": "Phlegmariurus molongensis, commonly known as the Molong clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Phlegmariurus molongensis is native to Australia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
