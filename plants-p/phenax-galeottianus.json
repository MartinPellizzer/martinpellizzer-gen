    "intro": "Phenax galeottianus, commonly known as the Galician thistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes or in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Phenax galeottianus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
