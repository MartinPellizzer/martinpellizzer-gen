    "intro": "Pneumatopteris inclusa, commonly known as the included water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Pneumatopteris inclusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
