    "intro": "Prunus communis subvar. cinerea, commonly known as the grey cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale grey bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart fruits called cherries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
