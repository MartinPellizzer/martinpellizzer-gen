    "intro": "Primula elongata f. barnardoana, commonly known as the Barnardo's primrose, is a rare and distinctive hybrid within the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a low-growing perennial that prefers partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
