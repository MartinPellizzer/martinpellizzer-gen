    "intro": "Piper krintjingense, commonly known as the Krintjingense pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Piper genus."
