    "intro": "Pandanus inflexus, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. The red pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
