    "intro": "Plantago salina, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in the spring. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
