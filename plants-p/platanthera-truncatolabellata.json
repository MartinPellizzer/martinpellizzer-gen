It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, truncated labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological specificity, making it a rare and protected plant in many regions."
