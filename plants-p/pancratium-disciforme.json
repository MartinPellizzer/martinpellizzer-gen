    "intro": "Pancratium disciforme, commonly known as the yellow torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble torches, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive dry periods and regenerate in favorable conditions. Pancratium disciforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
