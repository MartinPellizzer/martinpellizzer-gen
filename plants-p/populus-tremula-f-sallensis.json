    "intro": "Populus tremula f. sallensis, commonly known as the Sallenskog poplar, is a variant of the aspen tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This form is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in supporting local wildlife."
