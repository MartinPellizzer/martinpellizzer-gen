    "intro": "Pellaea flavescens var. macahensis, commonly known as the Mexican zigzag fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive, undulating pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
