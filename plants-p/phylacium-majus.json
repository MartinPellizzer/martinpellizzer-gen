    "intro": "Phylacium majus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in the early morning and open fully by midday. Phylacium majus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
