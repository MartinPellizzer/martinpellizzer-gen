    "intro": "Plectronia rheedei, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its timber, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Plectronia rheedei is considered an endangered species."
