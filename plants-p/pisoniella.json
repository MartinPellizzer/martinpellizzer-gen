    "intro": "Pisoniella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, flower clusters that resemble holly berries. Pisoniella species are generally small shrubs with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are often visited by insects, contributing to their ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
