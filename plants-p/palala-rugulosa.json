    "intro": "Palala rugulosa, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking red or orange-red flowers in late spring. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of showy, spurred orchid flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Palala rugulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
