    "intro": "Phyllanthus orbicularis var. genuinus, commonly known as the round-leaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly circular, leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
