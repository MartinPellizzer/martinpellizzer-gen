    "intro": "Protium panamense, commonly known as Panama protium, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
