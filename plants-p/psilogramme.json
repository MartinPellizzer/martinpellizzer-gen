    "intro": "Psilogramme, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or *Psilogramme ramosa*, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its reproductive structures consist of spikelets that produce three to five bracts, each bearing a single floret. Psilogramme is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its use in traditional medicine in some indigenous communities."
