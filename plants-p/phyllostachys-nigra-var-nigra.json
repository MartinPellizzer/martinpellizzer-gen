It is characterized by its dark, almost black culms that darken with age, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically a deep green color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Black bamboo is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 20 feet or more."
