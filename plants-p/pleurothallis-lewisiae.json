    "intro": "Pleurothallis lewisiae, commonly known as the Lewisia's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
