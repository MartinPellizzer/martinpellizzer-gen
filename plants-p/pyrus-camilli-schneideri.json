    "intro": "Pyrus camilli-schneideri, commonly known as the Camilli-Schneider pear, is a rare and little-known species of pear native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that typically ripen in late summer. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
