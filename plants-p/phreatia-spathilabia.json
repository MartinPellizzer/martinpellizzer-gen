    "intro": "Phreatia spathilabia, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy red petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive spathelate structure. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
