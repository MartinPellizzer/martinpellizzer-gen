    "intro": "Peperomia retusa var. ciliolata, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green to dark green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or green, which are not the main ornamental feature. Its foliage is the primary attraction, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
