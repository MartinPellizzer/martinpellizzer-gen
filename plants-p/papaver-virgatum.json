It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a smooth, slender stem and broad, lobed leaves that are typically green and hairy. Its flowers contain a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Papaver virgatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
