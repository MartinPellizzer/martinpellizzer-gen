    "intro": "Pithecellobium occultatum, commonly known as the hidden pithecellobium, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
