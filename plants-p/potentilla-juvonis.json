    "intro": "Potentilla juvonis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Potentilla juvonis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
