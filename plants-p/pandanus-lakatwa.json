    "intro": "Pandanus lakatwa, commonly known as the Lakatwa pandanus, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically long and narrow. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers, which are followed by triangular, fibrous fruits. The leaves are often used in traditional thatching and basket weaving due to their durability. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and wetland areas."
