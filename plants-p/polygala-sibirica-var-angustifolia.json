    "intro": "Polygala sibirica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces distinctive, bead-like seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
