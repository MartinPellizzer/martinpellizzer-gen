    "intro": "Phacelia neffii, commonly known as Neff's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Phacelia neffii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
