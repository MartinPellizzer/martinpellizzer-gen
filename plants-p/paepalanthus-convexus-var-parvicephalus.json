It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
