    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus reconditus, commonly known as the hidden fire cactus, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spiny, reddish-brown areoles. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrhocactus reconditus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
