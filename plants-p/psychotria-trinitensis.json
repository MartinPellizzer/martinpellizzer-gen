It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Psychotria trinitensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
