    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric pseudopod, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Tauric Chersonese region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in the region."
