    "intro": "Plectronia oddoni, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The botanical features of Plectronia oddoni make it well adapted to warm, humid climates and poor soil conditions."
