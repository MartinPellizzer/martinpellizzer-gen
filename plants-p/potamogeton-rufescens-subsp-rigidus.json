    "intro": "Potamogeton rufescens subsp. rigidus, commonly known as rigid pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, stiff, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it often grows in shallow, slow-moving waters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish. Its rigid, grass-like appearance helps it resist water currents, allowing it to establish dense stands in its preferred habitats."
