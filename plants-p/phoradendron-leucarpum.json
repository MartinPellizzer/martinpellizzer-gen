    "intro": "Phoradendron leucarpum, commonly known as the white-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green leaves and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds."
