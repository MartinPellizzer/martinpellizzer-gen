    "intro": "Pteropsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Pteropsis species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce spores on the underside of their fronds. The genus includes several species, each with unique foliage patterns and ecological adaptations."
