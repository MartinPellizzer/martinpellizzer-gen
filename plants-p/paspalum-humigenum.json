It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
