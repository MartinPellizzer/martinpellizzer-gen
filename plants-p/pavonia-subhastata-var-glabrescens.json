    "intro": "Pavonia subhastata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous pavonia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. This variety is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to other forms of Pavonia subhastata, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides in its native range."
