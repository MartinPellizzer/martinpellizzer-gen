    "intro": "Pouteria acutangula, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in humid, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a \"brazil nut,\" is enclosed in a hard shell and contains multiple seeds used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for numerous species in its native environment."
