It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. This form is a naturally occurring mutation, often found in the wild in regions with temperate climates. The plant produces capsule fruits containing seeds, typical of the Papaver genus. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
