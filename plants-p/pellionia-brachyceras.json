    "intro": "Pellionia brachyceras, commonly known as the dwarf pellionia, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which appear in spring or early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense foliage. Due to its compact size, it is well-suited for rock gardens, hanging baskets, or as a ground cover."
