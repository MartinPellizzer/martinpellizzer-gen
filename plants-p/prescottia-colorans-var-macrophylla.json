    "intro": "Prescottia colorans var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed Prescotia, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from orange to red, often with contrasting yellow throats. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are larger than the standard variety, giving it a more dramatic appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
