    "intro": "Pellaea alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks in the Appalachian region. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
