    "intro": "Polystichum melanostipes, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The fronds can reach up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking addition to shaded garden landscapes."
