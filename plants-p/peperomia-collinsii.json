    "intro": "Peperomia collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems covered with glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
