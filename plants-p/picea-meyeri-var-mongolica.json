    "intro": "Picea meyeri var. mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of northern China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. The tree thrives in cold, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable species for reforestation and ecological restoration. The plant plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
