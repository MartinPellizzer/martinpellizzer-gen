    "intro": "Palicourea jelskii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or Brazilian star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers and elliptical, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruits are small, acidic berries that are sometimes consumed locally, though they are not widely cultivated. Palicourea jelskii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally grown in horticultural settings."
