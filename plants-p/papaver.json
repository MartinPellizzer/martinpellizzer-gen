    "intro": "Papaver, commonly known as the poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and white. The flowers typically have four to six petals and are often surrounded by a prominent, saucer-shaped structure called the corona. Papaver species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are known for their opium-producing latex. Many species are cultivated for ornamental purposes or for their medicinal properties."
