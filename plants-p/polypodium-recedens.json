    "intro": "Polypodium recedens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a light green to dark green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or on rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
