    "intro": "Peniocereus hirschtianus, commonly known as the Hirschtian night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 15 centimeters. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are ribbed and covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
