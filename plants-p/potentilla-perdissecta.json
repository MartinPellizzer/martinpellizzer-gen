    "intro": "Potentilla perdissecta, commonly known as the dissected cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
