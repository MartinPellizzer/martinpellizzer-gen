    "intro": "Prosphysis, commonly known as the seedling stage of a plant, refers to the early developmental phase following germination. It is characterized by the emergence of the radicle, which develops into the primary root, and the plumule, which gives rise to the shoot system. During this stage, the plant relies entirely on its stored nutrients for growth and is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. The cotyledons, which are the first leaves, play a crucial role in photosynthesis and nutrient storage. Botanically, prosphysis is a critical phase that determines the plant's future growth and survival."
