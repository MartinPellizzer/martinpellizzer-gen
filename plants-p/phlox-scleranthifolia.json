    "intro": "Phlox scleranthifolia, commonly known as the rock phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Phlox scleranthifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
