    "intro": "Potentilla subarenaria, commonly known as sand potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Potentilla subarenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in dry landscapes."
