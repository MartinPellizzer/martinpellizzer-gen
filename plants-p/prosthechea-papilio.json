    "intro": "Prosthechea papilio, commonly known as the papilio orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and the presence of aerial roots that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive papilionaceous (butterfly-like) shape, often in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Prosthechea papilio is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical rainforests."
