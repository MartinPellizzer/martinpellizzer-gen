    "intro": "Pleroma fothergillae, commonly known as the Fothergill's pleroma, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant is known for its unique leaf morphology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma fothergillae is considered a vulnerable species."
