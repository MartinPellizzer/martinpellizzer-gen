    "intro": "Pentastira, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its spiny, alternate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Pentastira is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
