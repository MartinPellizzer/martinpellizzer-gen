    "intro": "Phedimus aizoon var. floribundus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to China. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, silvery-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce heat absorption. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Its hardy nature and ability to spread easily make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
