It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the rainforests of Central and South America. The plant features long, segmented stems with pinnate leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
