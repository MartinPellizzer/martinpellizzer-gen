    "intro": "Persea pedunculosa var. verbascifolia, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, orange to reddish fruits resembling persimmons. The leaves and fruits contain high levels of tannins, which can be astringent when unripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the fruit, which is consumed after it has fully ripened."
