    "intro": "Polypodium truncorum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, cliffs, and in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium truncorum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
