    "intro": "Physalis pubescens var. grisea, commonly known as the gray-tomentose groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive grayish appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits covered in a fuzzy, waxy coating. These fruits, often referred to as \"groundcherries,\" are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain several small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardens."
