    "intro": "Polycarpon alsinifolium var. leiospermum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It produces small, bladder-like structures that aid in water retention, a feature common in its genus."
