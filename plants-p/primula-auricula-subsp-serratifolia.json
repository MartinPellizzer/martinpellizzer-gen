    "intro": "Primula auricula subsp. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated auricula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season blooms. The subspecies is closely related to other Primula species, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
