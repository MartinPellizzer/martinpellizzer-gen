    "intro": "Phegopteris imponens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a shield. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
