    "intro": "Platanthera dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spicate inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. It is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
