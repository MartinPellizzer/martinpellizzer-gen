    "intro": "Poa airoides, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa airoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
