    "intro": "Pellaea zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pellaea, characterized by its unique, often finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
