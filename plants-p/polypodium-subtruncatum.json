    "intro": "Polypodium subtruncatum, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a broad, shield-shaped foliage. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, exhibiting a unique ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive sub-truncated appearance at the base. Polypodium subtruncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
