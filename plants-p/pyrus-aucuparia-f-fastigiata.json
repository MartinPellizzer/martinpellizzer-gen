    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright spindle apple, is a compact, narrow-growing cultivar of the common pear. It features a distinctive columnar shape with tightly packed, dark green leaves that provide dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to regular pears. It is well-suited for small gardens and urban spaces due to its compact form and ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its resistance to certain diseases and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
