It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
