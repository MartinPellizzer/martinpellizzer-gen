    "intro": "Panicum bidentulum, commonly known as two-tooth grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along creek banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowering structures are often greenish or reddish in color. Panicum bidentulum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
