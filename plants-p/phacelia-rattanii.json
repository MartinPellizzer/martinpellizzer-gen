    "intro": "Phacelia rattanii, commonly known as rattan phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Phacelia rattanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
