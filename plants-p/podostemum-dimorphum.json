    "intro": "Podostemum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, with its leaves often submerged in water while its flowers emerge above the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, which contributes to its genetic diversity. Podostemum dimorphum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
