    "intro": "Polythecium spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny polypore, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its tough, woody cap and a sponge-like pore structure instead of gills. This mushroom typically grows on dead wood, particularly on coniferous trees, and is found in temperate regions. Its spines, which give it the common name, are short and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The fruiting body is usually small to medium in size and can be found in forested areas during the late summer and autumn seasons."
