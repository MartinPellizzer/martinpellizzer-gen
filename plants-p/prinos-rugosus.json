    "intro": "Prinos rugosus, commonly known as the rough prion, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually covered in a rough, hairy texture. Prinos rugosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a slow growth rate. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
