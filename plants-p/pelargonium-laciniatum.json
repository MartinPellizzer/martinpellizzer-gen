    "intro": "Pelargonium laciniatum, commonly known as the serrated geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
