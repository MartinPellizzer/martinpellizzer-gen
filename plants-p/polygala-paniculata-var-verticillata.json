    "intro": "Polygala paniculata var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features wiry stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, whorled patterns. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to poor, sandy soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
