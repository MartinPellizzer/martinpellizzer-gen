    "intro": "Psilocarya, commonly known as the sacred mushroom, is a genus of fungi that contains psychoactive compounds, primarily psilocybin and psilocin. These compounds affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and thought. The plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on decaying wood or soil. They are widely studied for their potential therapeutic applications in mental health treatment. Due to their hallucinogenic properties, they are also used in traditional spiritual practices across various cultures."
