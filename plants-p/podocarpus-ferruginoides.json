    "intro": "Podocarpus ferruginoides, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It is highly valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and insect damage. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
