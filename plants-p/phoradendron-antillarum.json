    "intro": "Phoradendron antillarum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It has woody stems and produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant relies on other plants for some of its water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a distinctive waxy coating. It is commonly found growing on trees, particularly in humid tropical environments."
