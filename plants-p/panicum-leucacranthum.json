    "intro": "Panicum leucacranthum, commonly known as white panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, white plumes that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the genus Panicum. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common ornamental grass in gardens and landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself, it is often used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
