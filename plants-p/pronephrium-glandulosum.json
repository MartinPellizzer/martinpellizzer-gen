    "intro": "Pronephrium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky kidney fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often clustered and help anchor the plant in soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the leaves mature."
