    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems covered with small, rounded leaves that are typically hairy but are smooth in this variety. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
