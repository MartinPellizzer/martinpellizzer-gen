It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines, and its yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods containing edible seeds, which are a food source for various animals and humans. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. This species is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder."
