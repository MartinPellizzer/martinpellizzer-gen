    "intro": "Payena utilis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
