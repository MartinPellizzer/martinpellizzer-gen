    "intro": "Pisonia rotundata subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the Round-leaved Pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its fruit consists of fleshy, red berries that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
