    "intro": "Pilocereus coerulescens, commonly known as the blue moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
