It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediment and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
