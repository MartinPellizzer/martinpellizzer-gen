    "intro": "Podalyria alpina, commonly known as the alpine podalyria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Podalyria alpina is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats. Its blooming period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes."
