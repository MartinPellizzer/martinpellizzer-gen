    "intro": "Piper polysyphonum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature, containing several seeds. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
