    "intro": "Pitcairnia deroosei, commonly known as the Crimson Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rosette-shaped leaves are long and narrow, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Pitcairnia deroosei thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
