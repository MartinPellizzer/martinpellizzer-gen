    "intro": "Podandrogyne, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring both stamens and carpels on the same flower, a trait known as androgynous flowers. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Podandrogyne species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, greenish or reddish flowers that bloom in early spring."
