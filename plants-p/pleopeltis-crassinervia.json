    "intro": "Pleopeltis crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, creeping rhizomes and fronds that are typically divided into triangular segments. The leaves are leathery and have prominent, broad veins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
