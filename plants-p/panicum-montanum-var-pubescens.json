    "intro": "Panicum montanum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy mountain panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
