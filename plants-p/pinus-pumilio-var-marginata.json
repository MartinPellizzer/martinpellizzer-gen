    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. marginata, commonly known as the whitebark pine with a marginated variant, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the whitebark pine. It is characterized by its small, cone-like fruits and its unique foliage that often displays a white or silvery margin on the leaves. This variant is native to high-altitude regions of the western United States, where it thrives in cold, dry environments. Its cones are typically serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by fire or extreme heat. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
