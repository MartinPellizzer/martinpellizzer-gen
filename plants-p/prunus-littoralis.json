    "intro": "Prunus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cherry or sea cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries that ripen in summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and light gray. Prunus littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
