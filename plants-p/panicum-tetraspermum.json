    "intro": "Panicum tetraspermum, commonly known as four-seeded grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with four seeds per spikelet, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
