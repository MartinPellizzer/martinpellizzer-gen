    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. pervicaz, commonly known as the hardy climbing pea, is a variant of the common pea that exhibits greater cold tolerance and hardiness compared to standard garden peas. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to thrive in cooler climates, making it suitable for early spring planting. The plant produces tendrils that allow it to climb and support its heavy pods, which typically contain 4\u20136 seeds. Its botanical features include compound leaves with trifoliate structures and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in both ornamental and edible gardening."
