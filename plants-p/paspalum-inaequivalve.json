    "intro": "Paspalum inaequivalve, commonly known as the unequal-valved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps. Its flowers have distinctive asymmetrical lemma and palea structures, which give it its scientific name. Paspalum inaequivalve is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
