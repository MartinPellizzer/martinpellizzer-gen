    "intro": "Phalaris cristata, commonly known as the crowned grass or spiked grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spike-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Phalaris cristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
