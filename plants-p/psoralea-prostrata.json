    "intro": "Psoralea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate psoralea, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats."
