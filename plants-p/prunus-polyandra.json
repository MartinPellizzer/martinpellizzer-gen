The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Prunus polyandra is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for wildlife."
