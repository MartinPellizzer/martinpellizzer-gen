    "intro": "Polycnemum malacophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, disturbed soils. Polycnemum malacophyllum is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
