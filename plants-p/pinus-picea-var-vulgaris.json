    "intro": "Pinus picea var. vulgaris, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white or silver-blue bark, which becomes flaky with age. The needles are short, flat, and bluish-green, often with two white stomatal lines on their upper surface. It produces cones that are typically 4\u20138 cm long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions."
