    "intro": "Plantago durvillei var. chamaeclina, commonly known as the cushion plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It forms dense cushions of foliage, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months. This species is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
