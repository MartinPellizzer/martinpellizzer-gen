    "intro": "Pavetta gurueensis, commonly known as the Gurue pavetta, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Mozambique. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
