    "intro": "Pisum leptolobum, commonly known as the slender-podded pea, is a rare and little-studied legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pods and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces edible seeds that are similar to those of other pea species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
