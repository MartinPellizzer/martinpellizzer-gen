    "intro": "Panicum arundinariae, commonly known as bamboo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the genus Panicum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscape plant."
