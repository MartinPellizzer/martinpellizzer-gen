    "intro": "Pseudoscabiosa limonifolia, commonly known as lemonleaf pseudoscabiosa, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that emit a subtle lemon-like scent, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Pseudoscabiosa limonifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
