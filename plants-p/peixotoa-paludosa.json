    "intro": "Peixotoa paludosa, commonly known as the marsh peixotoa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a sprawling growth habit with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Peixotoa paludosa is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
