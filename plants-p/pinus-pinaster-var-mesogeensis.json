    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. mesogeensis, commonly known as the Greek maritime pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Pinus pinaster. The cones of this variety are generally smaller and more elongated, with a distinctive reddish-brown color. It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, adapting well to saline and rocky soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
