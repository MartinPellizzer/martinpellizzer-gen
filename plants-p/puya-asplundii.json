    "intro": "Puya asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's torchflower, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous red or orange flowers, which bloom sequentially from the base upward. The plant produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Puya asplundii is a monocarpic species, meaning it dies after flowering, but it can produce offsets that continue the life cycle. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
