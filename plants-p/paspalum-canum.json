    "intro": "Paspalum canum, commonly known as the rigid grass or slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, two-lobed flowers. Paspalum canum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
