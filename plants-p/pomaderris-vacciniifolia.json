    "intro": "Pomaderris vacciniifolia, commonly known as the sweet pepper bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
