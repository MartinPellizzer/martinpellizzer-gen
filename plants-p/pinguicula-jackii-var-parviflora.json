    "intro": "Pinguicula jackii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of succulent, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to maintain its health. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous nature, it is a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists."
