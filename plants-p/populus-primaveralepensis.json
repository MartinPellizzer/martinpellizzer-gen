    "intro": "Populus primaveralepensis, commonly known as the spring poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its rapid growth and slender, often weeping branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall before shedding. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
