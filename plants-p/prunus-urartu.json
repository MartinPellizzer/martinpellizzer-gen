    "intro": "Prunus urartu, commonly known as the Armenian apricot or dwarf apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits that are edible but typically not used for commercial purposes. Prunus urartu is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and spring blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes."
