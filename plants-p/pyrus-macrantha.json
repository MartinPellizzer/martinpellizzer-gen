    "intro": "Pyrus macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often preceding the foliage in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other pear species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus macrantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas."
