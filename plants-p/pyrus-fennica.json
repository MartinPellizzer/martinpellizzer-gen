    "intro": "Pyrus fennica, commonly known as the Finnish pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are used in local cuisine. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Pyrus fennica is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
