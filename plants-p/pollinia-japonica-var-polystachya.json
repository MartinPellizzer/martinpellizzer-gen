    "intro": "Pollinia japonica var. polystachya, commonly known as the Japanese orchid or Japanese bee orchid, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen that are transferred by insects, particularly bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
