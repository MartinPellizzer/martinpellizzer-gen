    "intro": "Prangos ledebourii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces violet or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Prangos ledebourii is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
