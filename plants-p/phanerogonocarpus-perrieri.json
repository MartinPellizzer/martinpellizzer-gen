It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, bisexual flowers with distinct sepals and petals. The plant exhibits a complex reproductive system, with specialized carpels that contribute to its classification as a gymnosperm-like angiosperm. It is typically found in specific tropical or subtropical habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
