    "intro": "Polygala uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spherical seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
