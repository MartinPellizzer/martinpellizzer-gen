    "intro": "Pleurothallis pacayana, commonly known as the Pacayana orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are often clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces tiny, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
