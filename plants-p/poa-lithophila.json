    "intro": "Poa lithophila, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on crevices and slopes where soil is scarce. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to anchor itself firmly in crevices, making it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Poa lithophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms."
