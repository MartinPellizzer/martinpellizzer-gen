    "intro": "Pilocereus barbatus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Pilocereus barbatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
