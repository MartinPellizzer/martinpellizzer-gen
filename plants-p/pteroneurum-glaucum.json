    "intro": "Pteroneurum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green pteroneurum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces a distinctive blue-green hue in its foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
