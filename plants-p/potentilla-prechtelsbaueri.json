    "intro": "Potentilla prechtelsbaueri, commonly known as the Sierra potentilla, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. Potentilla prechtelsbaueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
