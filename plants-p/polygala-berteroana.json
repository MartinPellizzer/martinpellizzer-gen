    "intro": "Polygala berteroana, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Polygala berteroana is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the fruit splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair."
