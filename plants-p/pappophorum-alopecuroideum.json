    "intro": "Pappophorum alopecuroideum, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silky-haired leaves that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
