    "intro": "Prunus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that bear clusters of delicate, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, edible fruits called drupes, which are similar in appearance to peaches. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal."
