    "intro": "Parosela crenulata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parosela crenulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
