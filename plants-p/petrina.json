    "intro": "Petrina, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Petrina species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties being evergreen. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making them valuable additions to gardens and natural habitats."
