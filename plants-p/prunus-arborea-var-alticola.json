    "intro": "Prunus arborea var. alticola, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red or black berries that are edible but typically tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
