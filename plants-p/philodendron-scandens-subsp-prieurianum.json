It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often slightly notched at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
