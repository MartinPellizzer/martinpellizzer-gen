    "intro": "Panicum langei, commonly known as the Lange's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Panicum langei is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in preventing soil erosion."
