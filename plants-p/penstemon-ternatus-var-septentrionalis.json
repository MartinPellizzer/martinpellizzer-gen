    "intro": "Penstemon ternatus var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
