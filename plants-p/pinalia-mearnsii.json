    "intro": "Pinalia mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' pinyon, is a species of coniferous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of the Pinaceae family. The tree produces small, edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. The bark of Pinalia mearnsii is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and extreme temperatures."
