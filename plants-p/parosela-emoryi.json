    "intro": "Parosela emoryi, commonly known as Emory's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
