It is characterized by its small, sweet, and juicy fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves, adding ornamental value to gardens. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty."
