    "intro": "Puya spathacea, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces tall, spathaceous inflorescences that bear vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Puya spathacea is adapted to cold, sunny conditions and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain."
