    "intro": "Persea tenuiflora, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits that ripen to a deep orange-red color. The fruit has a sweet, custard-like texture when fully mature and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is well-suited for cultivation in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11."
