It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural requirements."
