    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater stands. The leaves are elongated, broad, and typically arranged in whorls, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water resistance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms. This plant is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as lakes, ponds, and canals."
