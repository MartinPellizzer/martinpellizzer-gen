    "intro": "Pedicularis omiiana var. diffusa, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink and violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and sessile, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger and more diffuse growth habit compared to other Pedicularis species."
