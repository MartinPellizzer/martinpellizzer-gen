It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
