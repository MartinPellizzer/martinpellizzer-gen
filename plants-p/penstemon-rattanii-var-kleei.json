    "intro": "Penstemon rattanii var. kleei, commonly known as Klee's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to native plant gardens."
