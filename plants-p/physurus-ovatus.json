    "intro": "Physurus ovatus, commonly known as the oval leaf arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped or oval leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive blue or black berries. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in ornamental pond settings. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species if not managed properly."
