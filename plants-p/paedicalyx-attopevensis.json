    "intro": "Paedicalyx attopevensis, commonly known as the Attopevense rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the island of Madeira. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces unique, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
