    "intro": "Pilea verrucosa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, paddle-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on short stalks, which are followed by spherical, reddish-brown berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation as a decorative plant."
