    "intro": "Pergularia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping perwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
