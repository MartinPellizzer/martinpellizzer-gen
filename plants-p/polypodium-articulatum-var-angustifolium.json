    "intro": "Polypodium articulatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that have a delicate, feathery appearance. The fronds are typically 20\u201340 cm long and have a glossy, dark green surface with a serrated margin. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
