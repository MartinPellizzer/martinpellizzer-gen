    "intro": "Psidium submetrale, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or submetral guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
