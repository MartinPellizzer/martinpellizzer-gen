    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum keltonii, commonly known as Kelton's paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants adapted to moist, tropical environments. This species is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and climate change impacts."
