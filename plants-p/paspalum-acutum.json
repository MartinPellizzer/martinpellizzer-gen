    "intro": "Paspalum acutum, commonly known as stiff grass or narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental and landscaping purposes. Paspalum acutum is also used in some regions for forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature."
