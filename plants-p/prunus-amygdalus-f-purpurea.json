    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple almond or purple peach, is a cultivar of the almond tree characterized by its striking purple foliage. This ornamental variety features heart-shaped leaves that transition from deep purple to bronze in the fall, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits similar to regular almonds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for commercial nut production."
