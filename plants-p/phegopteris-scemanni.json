    "intro": "Phegopteris scemanni, commonly known as the Scemanni's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a complex and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in humid woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the leaf stalks. Phegopteris scemanni plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
