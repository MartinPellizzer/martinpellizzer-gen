    "intro": "Petrosedum subulatum, commonly known as the silver woolly stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
