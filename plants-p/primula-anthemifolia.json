It features a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage is typically aromatic, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Primula anthemifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
