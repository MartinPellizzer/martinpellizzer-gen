    "intro": "Poa epileuca, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates, it is valued in conservation and restoration projects."
