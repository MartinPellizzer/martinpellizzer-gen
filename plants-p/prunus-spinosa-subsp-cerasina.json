    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subsp. cerasina, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart, sharp flavor. The plant is often used in hedgerows and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
