    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata var. mikawana, commonly known as the Mikawa monkey orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its flowers are often pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
