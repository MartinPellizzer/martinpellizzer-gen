    "intro": "Pteris litobrochioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant's ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils makes it an adaptable and resilient species."
