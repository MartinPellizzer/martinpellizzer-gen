    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. megalepiscopi, commonly known as the giant pea, is a variant of the common pea plant characterized by its significantly larger pods and seeds compared to standard varieties. This variety is notable for its robust growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking addition to gardens or agricultural fields. The leaves are typically large and trifoliate, with a deep green color, while the flowers are usually pale blue or purple, typical of the Fabaceae family. The pods are thick-walled and can contain up to 10 seeds, which are usually larger and more round than those of typical peas. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential for cultivation as a food crop."
