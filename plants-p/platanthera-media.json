    "intro": "Platanthera media, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a conservation concern in some regions."
