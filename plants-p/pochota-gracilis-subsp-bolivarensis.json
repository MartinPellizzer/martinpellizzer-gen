    "intro": "Pochota gracilis subsp. bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian slender pochota, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
