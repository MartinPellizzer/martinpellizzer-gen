    "intro": "Phyllanthus humilis, commonly known as the small-leaf phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Phyllanthus humilis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
