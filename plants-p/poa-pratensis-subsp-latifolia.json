    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted growth habit, which distinguish it from other poa species. This subspecies typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Broadleaf meadow grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
