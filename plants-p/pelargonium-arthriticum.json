    "intro": "Pelargonium arthriticum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
