It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, pungent scent, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like structures. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the species."
