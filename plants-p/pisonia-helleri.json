    "intro": "Pisonia helleri, commonly known as the Heller's pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
