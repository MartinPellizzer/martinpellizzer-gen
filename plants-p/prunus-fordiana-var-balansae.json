It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
