    "intro": "Poa cristata, commonly known as the tufted grass or cristate grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of leaves forming a compact, upright clump. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often adorned with bristles, giving it a unique appearance. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Poa cristata is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
