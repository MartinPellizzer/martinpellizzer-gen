    "intro": "Pteris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Pteris yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
