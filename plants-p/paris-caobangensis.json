    "intro": "Paris caobangensis, commonly known as the Caobang Paris, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
