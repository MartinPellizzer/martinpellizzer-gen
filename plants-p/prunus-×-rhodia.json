    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodora cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrulata and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub or small tree. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Prunus \u00d7 rhodia is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
