    "intro": "Philodendron leyvae, commonly known as the silver-bell philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white vein pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by round, orange-red berries. Philodendron leyvae thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
