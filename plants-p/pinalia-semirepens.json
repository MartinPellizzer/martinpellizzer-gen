    "intro": "Pinalia semirepens, commonly known as the creeping pinyon, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes various pine species, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Pinalia semirepens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
