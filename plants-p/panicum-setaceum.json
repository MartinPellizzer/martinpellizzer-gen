It is characterized by its tufted, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinted leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often used as ornamental features in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself contribute to its adaptability in various environments."
