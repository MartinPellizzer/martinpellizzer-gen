    "intro": "Pinus cembra columnaris, commonly known as the Alpine stone pine, is a rare and slow-growing conifer native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its columnar growth habit, forming tall, narrow trees with a distinctive, almost tree-like appearance. The needles are short, dark green, and often twisted, while the cones are small and reddish-brown when mature. This species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
