    "intro": "Platanthera chorisiana var. chorisiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
