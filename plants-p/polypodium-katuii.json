It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The Katu fern's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
