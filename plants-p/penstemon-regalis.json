The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Penstemon regalis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological value."
