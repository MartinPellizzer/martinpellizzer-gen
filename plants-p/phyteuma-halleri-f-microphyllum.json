    "intro": "Phyteuma halleri f. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf phyteuma, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
