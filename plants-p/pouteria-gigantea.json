    "intro": "Pouteria gigantea, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spiny capsules containing seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are encased in a hard shell and are commercially valuable for their high oil content. The Brazil nut tree plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the Amazon, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
