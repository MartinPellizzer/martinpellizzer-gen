    "intro": "Peritassa calypsoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their unique appearance. Peritassa calypsoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
