    "intro": "Phegopteris megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, upright trunk and a crown of fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous trunk that is covered with a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, glossy surface that contributes to its ornamental appeal. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and moist woodlands."
