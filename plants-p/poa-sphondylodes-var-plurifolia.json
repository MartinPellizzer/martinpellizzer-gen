    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes var. plurifolia, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and ecological role, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
