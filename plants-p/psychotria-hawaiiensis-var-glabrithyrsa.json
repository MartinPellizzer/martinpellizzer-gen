    "intro": "Psychotria hawaiiensis var. glabrithyrsa, commonly known as the Hawaiian psychotria, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with smooth, glabrous surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. It plays a role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of Hawaii's unique flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
