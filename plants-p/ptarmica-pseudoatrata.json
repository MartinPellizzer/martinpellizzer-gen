    "intro": "Ptarmica pseudoatrata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark purple to greenish-gray foliage. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Ptarmica pseudoatrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
