    "intro": "Puya violacea var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate purple torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears vibrant purple and white flowers, which are arranged in a torch-like structure. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance."
