    "intro": "Premna latifolia var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's broadleaf premna, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged, elliptical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
