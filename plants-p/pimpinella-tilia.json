    "intro": "Pimpinella tilia, commonly known as the small cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure called a schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family. Pimpinella tilia is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
