    "intro": "Paronychia nivea var. davei, commonly known as the whiteleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that is typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, arranged closely along the stems, and often have a bluish-gray or whitish hue. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
