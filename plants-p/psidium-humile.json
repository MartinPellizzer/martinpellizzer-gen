    "intro": "Psidium humile, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple or little guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to those of the common guava but are typically smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Psidium humile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in home gardens."
