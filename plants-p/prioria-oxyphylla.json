It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that matures in the dry season. Prioria oxyphylla is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
