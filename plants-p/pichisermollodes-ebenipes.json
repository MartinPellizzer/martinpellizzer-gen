    "intro": "Pichisermollodes ebenipes, commonly known as the Andean ebony tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201320 meters and has broad, leathery leaves that are glossy in appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, black berries. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
