    "intro": "Pycnocomon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, helping to reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pycnocomon alpinum is considered a vulnerable species."
