It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum arechavaletae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
