It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant features erect, smooth stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered with fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer."
