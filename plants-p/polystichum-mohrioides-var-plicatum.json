    "intro": "Polystichum mohrioides var. plicatum, commonly known as the plicate holly fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive, folded appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
