    "intro": "Peperomia rupestris var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green, often with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
