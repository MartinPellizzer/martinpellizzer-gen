    "intro": "Panicum consanguineum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often turn reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in certain ecological settings."
