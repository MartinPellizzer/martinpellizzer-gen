    "intro": "Potentilla leucantha, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
