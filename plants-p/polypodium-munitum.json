    "intro": "Polypodium munitum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its reproductive cycle."
