    "intro": "Potentilla subacaulis var. clementei, commonly known as the Clement's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically divided into five leaflets, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
