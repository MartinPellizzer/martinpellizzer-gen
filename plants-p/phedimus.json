    "intro": "Phedimus, commonly known as the rock carnation, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in rocky or gravelly soils. They produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in spring. Phedimus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Their ability to spread via runners makes them effective for ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
