    "intro": "Psorodendron pubescens, commonly known as the hairy psorodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
