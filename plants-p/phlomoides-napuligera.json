    "intro": "Phlomoides napuligera, commonly known as the Naples phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal blooms."
