    "intro": "Psychotria pedunculosa, commonly known as the \"Blue-eyed Mary\" or \"Psychotria,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to blue and purple. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, some species within the genus Psychotria contain psychoactive compounds, though the specific effects of P. pedunculosa are less well-documented."
