    "intro": "Pellaea doniana, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, silvery-white fronds that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is short and thick, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. Pellaea doniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
