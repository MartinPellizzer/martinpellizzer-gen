    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. maritimus, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often forming dense stands along shorelines. The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal flooding. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize soil. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
