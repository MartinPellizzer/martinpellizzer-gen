    "intro": "Pteris brevis, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically slender and have a soft, pale green appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Pteris brevis is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
