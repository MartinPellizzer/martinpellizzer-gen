    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. tenerrima, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
