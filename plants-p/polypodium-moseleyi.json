    "intro": "Polypodium moseleyi, commonly known as the Moseley's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
