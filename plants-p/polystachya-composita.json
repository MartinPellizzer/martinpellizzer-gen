    "intro": "Polystachya composita, commonly known as the composite sword fern, is a member of the Polystachyaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Polystachya composita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
