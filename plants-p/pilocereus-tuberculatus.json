    "intro": "Pilocereus tuberculatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a compact, rounded shape with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert climates. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in rare and exotic plants."
