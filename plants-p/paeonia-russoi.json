    "intro": "Paeonia russoi, commonly known as the Russo peony, is a species of perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Paeoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves and produces woody rhizomes that help it survive in its natural habitat. Paeonia russoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
