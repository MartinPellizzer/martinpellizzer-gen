It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
