    "intro": "Pleopeltis macrocarpa var. interjecta, commonly known as the interjecta fern, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized epiphytic fern with lanceolate, dark green leaves that have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
