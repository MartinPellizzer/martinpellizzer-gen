    "intro": "Poa serotina var. effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, sod-like turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. It has a clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. Its foliage is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and durability."
