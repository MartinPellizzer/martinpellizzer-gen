    "intro": "Primula auricula subsp. bauhinii, commonly known as the auriculate primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and adjacent regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to the typical P. auricula."
