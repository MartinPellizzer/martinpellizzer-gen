    "intro": "Pseuduvaria obliqua, commonly known as the oblique pseuduvaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in cymes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, shaded environments. Pseuduvaria obliqua is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
