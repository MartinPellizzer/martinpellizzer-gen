    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
