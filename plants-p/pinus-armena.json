    "intro": "Pinus armena, commonly known as the Armenian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its cone-bearing structure. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into the characteristic pine seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The Armenian pine plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to local biodiversity."
