    "intro": "Pimpinella flabellifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Pimpinella flabellifolia is often found in calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
