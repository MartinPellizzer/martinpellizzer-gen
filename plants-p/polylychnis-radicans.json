    "intro": "Polylychnis radicans, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Polylychnis radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
