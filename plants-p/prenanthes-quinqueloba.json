    "intro": "Prenanthes quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed water hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
