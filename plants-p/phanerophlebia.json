These plants typically have well-developed vascular systems that support their tall, upright growth forms. They are predominantly found in tropical and temperate regions where they thrive in diverse ecological niches. Phanerophlebia includes a wide range of species such as trees, shrubs, and some herbaceous plants with woody stems. Their botanical significance lies in their role in ecosystem structure and biodiversity."
