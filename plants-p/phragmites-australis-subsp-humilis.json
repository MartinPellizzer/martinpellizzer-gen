    "intro": "Phragmites australis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is often found in marshes, lakeshores, and along riverbanks, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its widespread distribution."
