It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions. These plants are characterized by their erect, often hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. Pycnocoma species are often found in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
