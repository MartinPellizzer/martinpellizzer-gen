It is a small epiphytic orchid, typically growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
