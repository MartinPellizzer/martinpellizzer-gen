    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus subsp. apulcensis, commonly known as the Apulcense Pinyon, is a rare subspecies of the Mexican pinyon pine. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many pine species. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in dry, mountainous environments. Its cones are small and often remain closed for extended periods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
