    "intro": "Perama vellerea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline, coastal environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Perama vellerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
