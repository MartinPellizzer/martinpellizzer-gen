    "intro": "Phalaenopsis boxallii, commonly known as the Boxall's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming once a year. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
