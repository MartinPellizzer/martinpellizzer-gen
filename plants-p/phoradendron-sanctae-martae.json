    "intro": "Phoradendron sanctae-martae, commonly known as the sacred martian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, using a specialized root system called haustoria to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
