    "intro": "Panicum eruciforme, commonly known as the silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
