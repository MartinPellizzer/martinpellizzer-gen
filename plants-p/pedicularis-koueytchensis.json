    "intro": "Pedicularis koueytchensis, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
