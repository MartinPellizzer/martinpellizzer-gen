    "intro": "Pernettya oblongifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Its berries, which are edible, turn red or black when mature and are often consumed by wildlife. Pernettya oblongifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or heathlands."
