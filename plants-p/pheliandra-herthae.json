    "intro": "Pheliandra herthae, commonly known as the Herth's areca, is a species of palm native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, three-angled fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
