    "intro": "Pinguicula tejedensis, commonly known as the Tejedensian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its small, hooded flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pinguicula tejedensis is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
