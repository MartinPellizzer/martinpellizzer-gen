    "intro": "Polypodium leysii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial plant that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, curled appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Polypodium leysii is often found in forested areas and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
