    "intro": "Parathesis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf parathesis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
