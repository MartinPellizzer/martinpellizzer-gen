    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's pleurothallis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids in the canopy of old-growth forests."
