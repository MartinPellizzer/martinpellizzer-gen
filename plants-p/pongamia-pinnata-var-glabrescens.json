    "intro": "Pongamia pinnata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous pongamia, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically glabrous or nearly hairless, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing seeds that are rich in oil, making it valuable for biodiesel production. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
