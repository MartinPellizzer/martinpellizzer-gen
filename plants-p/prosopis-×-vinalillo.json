    "intro": "Prosopis \u00d7 vinalillo, commonly known as the Palo Verde tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prosopis flexuosa and Prosopis juliflora. It is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its green bark, which serves as a unique adaptation for photosynthesis in low-water environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by legume pods containing seeds. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization efforts."
