    "intro": "Pandanus semipilaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pandanus. It is native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical regions. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. The fruit, a fibrous structure containing seeds, is dispersed by water and animals, contributing to its spread in coastal and wetland habitats."
