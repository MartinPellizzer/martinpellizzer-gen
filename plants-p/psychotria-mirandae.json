    "intro": "Psychotria mirandae, commonly known as the Mirand\u00e1 Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
