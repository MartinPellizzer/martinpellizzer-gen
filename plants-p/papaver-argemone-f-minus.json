    "intro": "Papaver argemone f. minus, commonly known as the lesser argemone, is a variant of the argemone plant characterized by its smaller size and reduced floral features compared to the typical species. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, showy petals that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually hairy as well. The seeds are encased in a hard, waxy capsule, which splits open to release the seeds when mature."
