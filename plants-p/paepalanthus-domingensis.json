    "intro": "Paepalanthus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, edible fruits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
