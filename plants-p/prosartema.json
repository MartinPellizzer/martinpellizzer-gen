    "intro": "Prosartema, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions like Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. They typically grow in dry, open habitats and are often found in grasslands or disturbed soils. Prosartema species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their delicate, dandelion-like appearance."
