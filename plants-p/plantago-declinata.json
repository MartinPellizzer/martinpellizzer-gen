    "intro": "Plantago declinata, commonly known as the bent plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is characterized by its upright, somewhat zigzagging stems. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can be slightly curled at the edges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
