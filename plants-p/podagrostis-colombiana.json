It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Podagrostis colombiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
