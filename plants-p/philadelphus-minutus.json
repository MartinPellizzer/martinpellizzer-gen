    "intro": "Philadelphus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf goldthread, is a small shrub native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It features showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
