    "intro": "Plantago hungarica, commonly known as Hungarian plantain, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically clustered near the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
