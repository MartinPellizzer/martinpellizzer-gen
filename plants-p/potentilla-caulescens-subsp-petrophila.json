    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. petrophila, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Its growth habit makes it an important component of xerophytic plant communities in its native habitat."
