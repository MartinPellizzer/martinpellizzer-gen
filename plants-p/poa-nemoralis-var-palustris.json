    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to moist, temperate regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
