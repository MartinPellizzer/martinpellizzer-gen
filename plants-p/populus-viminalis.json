It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows along riverbanks and in moist habitats. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The bark of Populus viminalis is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
