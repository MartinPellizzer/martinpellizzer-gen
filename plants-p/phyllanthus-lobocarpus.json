    "intro": "Phyllanthus lobocarpus, commonly known as the Philippine sandpaper plant, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Phyllanthus lobocarpus is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments."
