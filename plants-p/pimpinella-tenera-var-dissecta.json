It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a wildflower in naturalized settings."
