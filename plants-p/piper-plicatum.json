    "intro": "Piper plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag pepper, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often zigzagging leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, slender fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Piper plicatum is also valued as a spice in some local cuisines."
