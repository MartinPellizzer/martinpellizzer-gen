    "intro": "Perezia beckii, commonly known as the Beck's perezia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia beckii is considered a rare and endangered species."
