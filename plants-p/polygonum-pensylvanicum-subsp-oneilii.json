    "intro": "Polygonum pensylvanicum subsp. oneilii, commonly known as the Pennsylvania smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland edges, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that disperse by wind. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
