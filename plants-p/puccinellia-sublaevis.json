    "intro": "Puccinellia sublaevis, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
