    "intro": "Psychotria rugegensis, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Psychotria rugegensis is also noted for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methyl-N-[2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethyl]piperidine."
