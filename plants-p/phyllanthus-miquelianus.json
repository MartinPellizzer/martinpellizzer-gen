    "intro": "Phyllanthus miquelianus, commonly known as the Miquel's spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds, and it is often found in woodland or shaded areas. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though its botanical features are more notable for their structural adaptations to its native environment."
