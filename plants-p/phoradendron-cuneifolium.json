    "intro": "Phoradendron cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for bird dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food for various wildlife species."
