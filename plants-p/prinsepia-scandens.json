    "intro": "Prinsepia scandens, commonly known as the wild apricot or sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible drupes that resemble cherries. Prinsepia scandens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
