It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in association with specific host plants. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
