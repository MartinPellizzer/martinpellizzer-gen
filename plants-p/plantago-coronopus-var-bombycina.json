    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. bombycina, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
