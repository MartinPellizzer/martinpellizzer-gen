    "intro": "Pteris grevilleana subsp. digitata, commonly known as the digitate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that resemble fingers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water sources. Its rhizomes are often creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive addition to moist, tropical gardens."
