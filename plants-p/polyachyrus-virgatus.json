    "intro": "Polyachyrus virgatus, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both livestock and humans."
