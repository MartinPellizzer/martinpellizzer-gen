    "intro": "Paeonia broteri, commonly known as the Broter's peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying shades of pink, white, and red. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are broad and hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia broteri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
