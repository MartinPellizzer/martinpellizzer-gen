It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by tiny, elongated berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to mimic its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
