    "intro": "Paspalum costatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and coastal marshes. Due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in these environments."
