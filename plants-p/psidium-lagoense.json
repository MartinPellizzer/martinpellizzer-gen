    "intro": "Psidium lagoense, commonly known as the Lagoense Guava, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub or small tree form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruit has a sweet, aromatic flavor with a delicate texture. Psidium lagoense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
