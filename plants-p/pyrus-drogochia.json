    "intro": "Pyrus drogochia, commonly known as the Drogo's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with broad leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
