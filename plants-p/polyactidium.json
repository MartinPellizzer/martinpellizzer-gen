    "intro": "Polyactidium, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which is embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Polyactidium is found in various regions, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America."
