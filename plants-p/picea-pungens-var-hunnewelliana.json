    "intro": "Picea pungens var. hunnewelliana, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and striking blue-gray needles that are tightly clustered along the branches. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for small landscapes or as a specimen tree. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is relatively cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures as low as -40\u00b0F. This ornamental evergreen is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and year-round visual interest."
