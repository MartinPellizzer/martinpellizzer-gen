    "intro": "Prasophyllum amoenum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in heathland and woodland habitats, particularly in southern Australia. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a spike, often with a subtle fragrance. Prasophyllum amoenum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
