    "intro": "Polygala sibirica var. megalopha, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
