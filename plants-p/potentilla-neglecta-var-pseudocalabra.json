    "intro": "Potentilla neglecta var. pseudocalabra, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features wiry, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
