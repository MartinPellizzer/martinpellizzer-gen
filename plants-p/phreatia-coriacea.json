    "intro": "Phreatia coriacea, commonly known as the hardy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, often blooming in the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
