    "intro": "Polygonum glaciale, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Polygonum glaciale is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
