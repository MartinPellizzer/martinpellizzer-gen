    "intro": "Pouteria arenicola, commonly known as the coastal spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. Its fruit is typically consumed fresh or used in local cuisine, and the tree is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments. Pouteria arenicola plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
