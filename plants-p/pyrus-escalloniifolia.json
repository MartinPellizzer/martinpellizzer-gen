    "intro": "Pyrus escalloniifolia, commonly known as the Escalloniifolia pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible fruits that are similar to pears in texture but have a unique, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The species is also valued for its potential in horticultural breeding programs."
