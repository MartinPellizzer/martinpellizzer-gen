    "intro": "Plocama iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's plocama, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
