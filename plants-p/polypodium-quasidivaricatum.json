    "intro": "Polypodium quasidivaricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is notable for its slow growth and preference for well-drained, acidic soils."
