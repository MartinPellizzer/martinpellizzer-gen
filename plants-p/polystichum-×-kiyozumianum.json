    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 kiyozumianum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile, evergreen fern that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum marmoratum. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin and a pale, fuzzy underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
