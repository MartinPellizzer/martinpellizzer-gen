    "intro": "Paullinia austin-smithii, commonly known as the Austin-Smith's soursop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but with distinct botanical features. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of its genus."
