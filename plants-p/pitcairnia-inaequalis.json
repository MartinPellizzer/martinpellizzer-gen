    "intro": "Pitcairnia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
