    "intro": "Potentilla czerepninii, commonly known as the Czerepnin's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
