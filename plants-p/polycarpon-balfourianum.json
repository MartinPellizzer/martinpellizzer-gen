It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants commonly referred to as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
