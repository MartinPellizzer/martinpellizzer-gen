It features a dense, upright frond structure with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is fibrous and contributes to its hardy nature, allowing it to thrive in cool, humid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
