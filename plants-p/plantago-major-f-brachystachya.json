    "intro": "Plantago major f. brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed plantain, is a variant of the common plantain with distinct botanical characteristics. It features shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form, with bracts that are often more tightly arranged. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, along paths, and in urban environments. This form is adapted to tolerate various environmental conditions, making it a resilient and widespread plant."
