    "intro": "Pityrodia racemosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Pityrodia racemosa is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
