    "intro": "Polypodium scabridum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its deeply divided, bright green fronds that are covered with a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium scabridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
