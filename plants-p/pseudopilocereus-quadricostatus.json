    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus quadricostatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a columnar growth form and typically produces flowers that last only a few hours. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique flowering pattern makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
