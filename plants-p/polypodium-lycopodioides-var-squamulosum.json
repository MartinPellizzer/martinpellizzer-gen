    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulose shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance with small, scale-like structures along the veins. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. This variety is often found in rocky or forested areas where it can anchor itself to substrates."
