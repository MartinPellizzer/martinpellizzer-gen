    "intro": "Panopsis lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's panopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panopsis lozanoi is considered a vulnerable species."
