    "intro": "Pothomorphe dussii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy soils, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Pothomorphe dussii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
