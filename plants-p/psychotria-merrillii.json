It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Psychotria merrillii is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses in traditional medicine."
