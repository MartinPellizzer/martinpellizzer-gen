    "intro": "Pterocarpus cabrae, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight. Due to overharvesting, Pterocarpus cabrae is considered vulnerable in some areas, prompting conservation efforts to protect its population."
