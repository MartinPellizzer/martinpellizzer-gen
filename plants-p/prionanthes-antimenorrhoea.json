    "intro": "Prionanthes antimenorrhoea, commonly known as the \"abortifacient bladdernut,\" is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, turning red as they ripen. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties, historically used for its abortifacient effects, though its use is now largely restricted due to toxicity."
