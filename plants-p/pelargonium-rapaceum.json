    "intro": "Pelargonium rapaceum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. Pelargonium rapaceum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
