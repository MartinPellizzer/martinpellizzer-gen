    "intro": "Paeonia russoi var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough peony, is a rare and distinctive variety of peony native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and showy, single or semi-double flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates, making it a sought-after species among horticulturists. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a compact growth habit, which contribute to its resilience in challenging environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
