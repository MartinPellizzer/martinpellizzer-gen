It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in low-nutrient environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in xerophytic landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
