    "intro": "Parrya arctica, commonly known as the Arctic parrya, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with small, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra habitats. Parrya arctica plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is an indicator of extreme environmental conditions."
