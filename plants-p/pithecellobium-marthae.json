    "intro": "Pithecellobium marthae, commonly known as the Marthas pithecellobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a slightly hairy surface, and it has a shallow root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its delicate, fragrant flowers."
