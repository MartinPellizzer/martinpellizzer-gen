    "intro": "Pyrrosia subfurfuracea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The plant's unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats make it a notable species in botanical studies."
