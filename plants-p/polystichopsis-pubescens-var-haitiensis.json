    "intro": "Polystichopsis pubescens var. haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian shield fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to Haiti. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a unique, dense pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its fronds are leathery and have a dark green color with a rough, textured surface. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
