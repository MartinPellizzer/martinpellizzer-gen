    "intro": "Polystichum jenningsii, commonly known as the Jennings' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant year-round. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, attractive fern for shaded landscapes."
