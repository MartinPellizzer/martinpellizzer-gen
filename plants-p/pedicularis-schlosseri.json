    "intro": "Pedicularis schlosseri, commonly known as the Schlosser's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the appearance of insect wings. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
