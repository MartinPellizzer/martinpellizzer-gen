    "intro": "Prunus nana, commonly known as dwarf cherry or dwarf sour cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter, with dense, spreading branches and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, tart red fruits. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact size and attractive foliage. Prunus nana is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
