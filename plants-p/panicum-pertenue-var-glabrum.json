    "intro": "Panicum pertenue var. glabrum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with delicate, hair-like bristles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
