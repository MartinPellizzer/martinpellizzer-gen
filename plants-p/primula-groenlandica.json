    "intro": "Primula groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Primula groenlandica plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of resilience in extreme environments."
