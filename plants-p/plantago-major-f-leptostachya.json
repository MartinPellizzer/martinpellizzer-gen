    "intro": "Plantago major f. leptostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its slender, upright flowering stems. This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed or compacted soils. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in lawns, along pathways, and in other urban environments where it can tolerate moderate foot traffic."
