    "intro": "Piper lepturum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pepper plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, elongated stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
