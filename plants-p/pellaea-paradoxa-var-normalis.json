    "intro": "Pellaea paradoxa var. normalis, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year, unlike most ferns. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, fan-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens."
