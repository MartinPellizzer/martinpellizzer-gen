    "intro": "Polystichum fallax, commonly known as the fallax shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Polystichum fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and textural qualities."
