    "intro": "Pitcairnia integrifolia var. major, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, evergreen leaves that form a rosette shape, often reaching several feet in length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
