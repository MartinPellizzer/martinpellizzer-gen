    "intro": "Pteris loheri, commonly known as the Loher's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
