    "intro": "Peucedanum cervariifolium, commonly known as the horned pepper or mountain celery, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive leaf structures. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are fibrous and have a mild, peppery flavor, making it a valued herb in traditional medicine. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
