    "intro": "Paronychia arabica var. inarmata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
