    "intro": "Peliosanthes reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Peliosanthes reflexa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
