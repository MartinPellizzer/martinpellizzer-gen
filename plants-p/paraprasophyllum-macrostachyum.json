This plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. The plant's unique morphology includes long, strap-like leaves and a dense inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
