    "intro": "Pronephrium solsonicum, commonly known as the Solsonic kidney fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that resemble a fern's typical structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires shade to prevent leaf scorching. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
