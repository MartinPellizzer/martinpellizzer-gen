It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Plagiobothrys orthostatus is considered a rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
