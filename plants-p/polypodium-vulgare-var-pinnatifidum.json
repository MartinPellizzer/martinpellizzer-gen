    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided leaflets arranged in a distinctive, lacy pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth throughout the growing season. The spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
