    "intro": "Pterostylis zebrina, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated greenish-yellow flower spike that bears a single, showy flower with a prominent, dark brown or black lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich structure. The zebra orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
