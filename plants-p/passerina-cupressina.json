    "intro": "Passerina cupressina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a dense network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, scale-like leaves are reduced and inconspicuous, allowing it to remain hidden beneath its host. Despite its parasitic nature, Passerina cupressina plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
