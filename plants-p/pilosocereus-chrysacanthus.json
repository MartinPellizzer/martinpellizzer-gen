    "intro": "Pilosocereus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that form a tree-like structure, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and collections."
