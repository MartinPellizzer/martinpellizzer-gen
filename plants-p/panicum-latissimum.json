    "intro": "Panicum latissimum, commonly known as broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems."
