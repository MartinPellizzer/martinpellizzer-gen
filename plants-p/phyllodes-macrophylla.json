It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its long, needle-like phyllodes that are often bright green. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its phyllodes are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy soils across eastern Australia."
