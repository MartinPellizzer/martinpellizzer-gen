    "intro": "Pitcairnia cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, which is essential for its survival in high-altitude environments. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
