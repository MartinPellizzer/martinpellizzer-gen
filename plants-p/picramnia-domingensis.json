It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with the true flowers being the small, yellowish structures surrounded by the colorful bracts."
