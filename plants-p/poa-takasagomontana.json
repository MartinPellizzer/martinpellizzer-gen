It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
