    "intro": "Pitcairnia rigida, commonly known as the rigid pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
