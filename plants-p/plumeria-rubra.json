    "intro": "Plumeria rubra, commonly known as the frangipani, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that come in white, yellow, or pink hues, often with a waxy texture. The plant has simple, opposite, and deciduous leaves that turn yellow before falling off in dry seasons. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. Plumeria rubra is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking blooms and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
