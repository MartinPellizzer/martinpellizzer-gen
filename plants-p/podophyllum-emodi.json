It features a short, rhizomatous stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
