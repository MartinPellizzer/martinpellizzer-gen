    "intro": "Pinus inops subsp. clausa, commonly known as the closed-cone pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its unique cone structure, which remains closed until the seeds are mature, a feature that aids in seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to thrive. Its foliage consists of long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, providing a dense canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
