    "intro": "Potentilla rubescens, commonly known as the rose willow or red potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, rose-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves that add visual interest throughout the growing season. Potentilla rubescens is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
