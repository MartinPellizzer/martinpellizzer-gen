    "intro": "Pristimera austin-smithii, commonly known as the Austin-Smith's pristimera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
