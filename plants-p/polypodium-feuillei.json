    "intro": "Polypodium feuillei, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
