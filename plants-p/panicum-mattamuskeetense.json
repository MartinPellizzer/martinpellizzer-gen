    "intro": "Panicum mattamuskeetense, commonly known as Mattamuskeet grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color, which become more prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
