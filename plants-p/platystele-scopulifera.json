    "intro": "Platystele scopulifera, commonly known as the rock-creeping platystele, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome with a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike, with a distinctive, elongated ovary. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
