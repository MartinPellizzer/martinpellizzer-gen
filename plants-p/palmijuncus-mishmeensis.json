    "intro": "Palmijuncus mishmeensis, commonly known as the Mishmi palm, is a rare and unique palm species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically found in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
