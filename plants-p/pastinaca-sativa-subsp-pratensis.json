    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are long and cylindrical, often resembling those of the common parsnip but less commonly used in culinary contexts. The species is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks, thriving in temperate climates."
