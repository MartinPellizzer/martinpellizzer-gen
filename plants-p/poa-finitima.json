    "intro": "Poa finitima, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a rare and cold-adapted grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Poa finitima is considered a vulnerable species."
