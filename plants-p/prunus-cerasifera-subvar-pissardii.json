    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subvar. pissardii, commonly known as the cherry laurel or Prunus pissardii, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with glossy leaves and showy blossoms that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its leaves and fruits."
