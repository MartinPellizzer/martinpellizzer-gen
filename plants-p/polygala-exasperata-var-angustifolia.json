    "intro": "Polygala exasperata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems and small, usually greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its root system is adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats. The plant's floral structure is notable for its unique, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
