    "intro": "Pilosella iserana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, and it produces a compact cluster of florets that bloom in early summer. Pilosella iserana is often found in meadows and mountainous areas, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
