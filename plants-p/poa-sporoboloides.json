    "intro": "Poa sporoboloides, commonly known as the tussock bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and forms extensive tussocks, which help stabilize soil in various habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems, supporting biodiversity and soil health."
