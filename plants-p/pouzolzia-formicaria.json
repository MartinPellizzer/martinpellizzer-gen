    "intro": "Pouzolzia formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical climbing shrub belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, dry fruits. Pouzolzia formicaria thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
