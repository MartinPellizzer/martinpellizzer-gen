It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits. These fruits are typically edible when ripe, though they may have a tart or spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions and is often used in traditional medicine."
