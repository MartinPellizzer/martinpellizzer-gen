    "intro": "Poa trivialis subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved meadow grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable environments. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an indicator species for nutrient-rich soils."
