    "intro": "Polygala kubangensis, commonly known as the Borneo milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, often yellow or greenish, flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
