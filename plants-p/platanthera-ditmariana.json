    "intro": "Platanthera ditmariana, commonly known as the Ditmar's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white or pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
