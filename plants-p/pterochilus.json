    "intro": "Pterochilus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are characterized by their succulent stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often used in traditional medicine and have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Pterochilus species typically have a short growth period, blooming after rainfall and then going dormant during droughts."
