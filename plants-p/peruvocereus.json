    "intro": "Peruvocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to arid environments. The plants produce large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. These flowers are typically white or pale pink and can bloom for only a few hours. Peruvocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
