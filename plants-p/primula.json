    "intro": "Primula, commonly known as the primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Primulas typically have a rosette of leaves at the base, with the flowers emerging from the center. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Many species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
