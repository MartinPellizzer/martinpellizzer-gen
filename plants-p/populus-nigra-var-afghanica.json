    "intro": "Populus nigra var. afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan black poplar, is a variant of the black poplar native to regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically medium to large in size. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse seeds via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in riparian zones. This species is valued for its ecological role and historical use in traditional medicine."
