    "intro": "Polypodium pinnatissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a slender, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other fern species."
