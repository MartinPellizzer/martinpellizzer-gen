It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its trunk is short and stout, often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
