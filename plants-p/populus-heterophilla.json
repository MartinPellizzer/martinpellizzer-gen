    "intro": "Populus heterophilla, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, serrated leaves that are typically lighter green on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Populus heterophilla is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
