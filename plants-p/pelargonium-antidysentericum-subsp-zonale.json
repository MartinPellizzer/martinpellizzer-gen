    "intro": "Pelargonium antidysentericum subsp. zonale, commonly known as the zoned geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often marked with distinct zonation patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
