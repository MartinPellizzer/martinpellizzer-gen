    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. collina, commonly known as the alpine narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and mountain slopes. Due to its ecological significance, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
