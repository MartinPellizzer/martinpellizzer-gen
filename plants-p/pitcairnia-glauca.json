    "intro": "Pitcairnia glauca, commonly known as the blue pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with vibrant blue-violet flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Pitcairnia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
