    "intro": "Phlox nana subsp. ensifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf garden phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and woodland settings."
