    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. nigra, commonly known as black hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves that are pinnately divided with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with caution."
