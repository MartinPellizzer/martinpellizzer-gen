    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. mollior, commonly known as the soft-haired plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
