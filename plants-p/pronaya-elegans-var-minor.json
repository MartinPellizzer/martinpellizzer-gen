It features delicate, feathery leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance, which is characteristic of the genus Pronaya. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
