    "intro": "Polypodium parvulum, commonly known as the small fern or the little maid's hair, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium parvulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
