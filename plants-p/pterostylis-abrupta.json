    "intro": "Pterostylis abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped floral structure, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is often partially hidden beneath a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, and its reproductive success is closely tied to its ecological niche."
