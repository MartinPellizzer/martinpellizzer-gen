    "intro": "Pichisermollia ebenipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Its growth habit is often shrub-like or small tree-like, with a tendency to spread through vegetative propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
