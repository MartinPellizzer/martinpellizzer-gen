    "intro": "Panicum viale, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to silver spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Panicum viale is a valuable component of prairie ecosystems and supports a variety of pollinators."
