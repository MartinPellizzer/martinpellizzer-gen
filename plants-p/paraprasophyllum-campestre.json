    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum campestre, commonly known as the field paraprasophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces distinctive, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
