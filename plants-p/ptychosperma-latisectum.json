    "intro": "Ptychosperma latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
