    "intro": "Procris grandis, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence with numerous fragrant, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces broad, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, and the plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Procris grandis is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
