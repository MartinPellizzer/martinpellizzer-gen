    "intro": "Picea menziesii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to western North America. It is characterized by its long, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect damage. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
