    "intro": "Pseudalcantarea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered pseudalcantarea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Colombia and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
