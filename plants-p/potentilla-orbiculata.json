    "intro": "Potentilla orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid regions."
