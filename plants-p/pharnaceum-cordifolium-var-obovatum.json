The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broadest near the base and taper towards the tip. This plant exhibits a dense, compact growth habit with a rosette structure. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
