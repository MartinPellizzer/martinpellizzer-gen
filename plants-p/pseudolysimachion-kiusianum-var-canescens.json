    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion kiusianum var. canescens, commonly known as the silver-haired bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
