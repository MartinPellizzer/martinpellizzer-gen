    "intro": "Pleione flavida, commonly known as the yellow pleione, is a rare and beautiful orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its cool, humid habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, emerging from the base of the pseudobulbs. Pleione flavida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
