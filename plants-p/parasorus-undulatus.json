    "intro": "Parasorus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy parasol mushroom, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped cap that has a wavy, undulating margin. The cap is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and the gills are initially pale but turn reddish-brown with age. This mushroom is often found growing in association with certain tree species, particularly in temperate forest environments. It is saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
