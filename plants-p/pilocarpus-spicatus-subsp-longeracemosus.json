    "intro": "Pilocarpus spicatus subsp. longeracemosus, commonly known as the long-bracted pilocarpus, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This species is notable for its use in traditional medicine, where its leaves are employed for their stimulant and diuretic properties."
