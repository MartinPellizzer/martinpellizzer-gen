    "intro": "Petrophile dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Petrophile dubia is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
