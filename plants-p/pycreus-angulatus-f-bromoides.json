    "intro": "Pycreus angulatus f. bromoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pycreus, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
