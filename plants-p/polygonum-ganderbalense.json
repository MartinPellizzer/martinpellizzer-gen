    "intro": "Polygonum ganderbalense, commonly known as the Ganderbal knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir Valley in India. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
