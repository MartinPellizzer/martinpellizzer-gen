    "intro": "Panax notoginseng, commonly known as notoginseng or tianqi, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive rhizome, which is the primary part used medicinally. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Its roots and rhizomes contain saponins, alkaloids, and other bioactive compounds that contribute to its traditional use in Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Notoginseng is highly valued for its purported ability to promote blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and enhance physical endurance."
