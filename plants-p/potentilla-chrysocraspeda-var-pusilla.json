    "intro": "Potentilla chrysocraspeda var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf golden potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, upright stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in its survival in high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and hardy nature make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
