    "intro": "Pouteria firma, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds. The tree's flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit, which matures over several months, is essential for the propagation of the species. Pouteria firma is also valued for its ecological role and is a significant component of the rainforest ecosystem."
