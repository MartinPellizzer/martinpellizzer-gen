    "intro": "Plantago monticola var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ground cover in landscaping."
