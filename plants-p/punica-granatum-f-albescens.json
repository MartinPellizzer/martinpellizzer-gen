    "intro": "Punica granatum f. albescens, commonly known as the white pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate tree characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and fruit. This variety is notable for its reduced pigmentation compared to typical pomegranates, which results in a more delicate appearance. The plant retains the typical structure of the pomegranate, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and a robust, thorny stem. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. While the fruit is edible, it is generally smaller and less flavorful than the standard pomegranate."
