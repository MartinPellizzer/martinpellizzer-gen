    "intro": "Pyrrosia fissa, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia fissa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
