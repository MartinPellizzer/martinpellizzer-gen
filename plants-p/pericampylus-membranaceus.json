    "intro": "Pericampylus membranaceus, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a delicate and unique fern species characterized by its thin, membranous fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant's fronds are typically arching and have a distinctive, almost papery texture, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental appeal and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
