    "intro": "Plantago hakusanensis f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-veined plantain, is a variant of the plantain species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves often display a distinctive greenish tint, particularly along the veins, which sets it apart from other plantain varieties. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
