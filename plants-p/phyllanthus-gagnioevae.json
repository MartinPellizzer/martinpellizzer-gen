It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its natural habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its ecosystem."
