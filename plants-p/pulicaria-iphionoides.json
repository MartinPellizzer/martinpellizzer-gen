    "intro": "Pulicaria iphionoides, commonly known as the yellow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pulicaria iphionoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
