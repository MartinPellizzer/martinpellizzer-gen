    "intro": "Pedicularis limithangensis, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, often reddish or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Pedicularis limithangensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its alpine habitat, though it is relatively rare and not widely studied."
