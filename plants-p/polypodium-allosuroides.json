    "intro": "Polypodium allosuroides, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often deeply lobed or divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium allosuroides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
