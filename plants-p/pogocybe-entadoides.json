    "intro": "Pogocybe entadoides, commonly known as the entadoides earth tongue, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, white to pale yellow cap and a dense, fibrous stem that resembles a tongue. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in temperate forests. The spore-producing surface, or gills, are attached to the stem and are not easily detached. This species is often found in association with coniferous trees and is more commonly observed in the northern hemisphere."
