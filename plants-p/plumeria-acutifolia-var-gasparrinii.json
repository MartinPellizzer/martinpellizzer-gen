    "intro": "Plumeria acutifolia var. gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparrini's flame tree, is a variant of the tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while the plant has a woody stem with a fibrous, cork-like bark. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display and aromatic properties."
