    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subf. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple, edible berries. These berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are typically too tart for direct consumption. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
