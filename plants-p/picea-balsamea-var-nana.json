    "intro": "Picea balsamea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf balsam fir, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its short, stiff branches and dense, dark green foliage that turns a bluish-gray in winter. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscape design."
