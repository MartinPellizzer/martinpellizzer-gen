    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. pygmaea, commonly known as the Pygmy Pine, is a compact, dwarf form of the Aleppo pine. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and short, twisted branches, which give it a distinctive, gnarled appearance. This variety is native to the southern Alps and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold, dry conditions. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular ornamental plant in rock gardens and alpine settings. The cones are small and often remain closed for many years, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
