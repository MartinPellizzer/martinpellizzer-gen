    "intro": "Pinus lasiocarpa, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to western North America. It is characterized by its serotinous cones, which remain closed until triggered by heat from a forest fire, releasing seeds for regeneration. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for over 1,000 years, making it a long-lived species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and pests. The plant plays an important ecological role in high-elevation ecosystems, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
