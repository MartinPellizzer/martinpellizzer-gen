    "intro": "Pleurothallis sonderiana var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
