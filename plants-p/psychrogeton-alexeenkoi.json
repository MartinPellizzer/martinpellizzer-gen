    "intro": "Psychrogeton alexeenkoi, commonly known as the Siberian snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude, alpine environments where temperatures remain low throughout the growing season. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
