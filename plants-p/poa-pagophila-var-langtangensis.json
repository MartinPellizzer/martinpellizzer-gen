    "intro": "Poa pagophila var. langtangensis, commonly known as the Langtang hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes above the tree line. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to extreme altitudes."
