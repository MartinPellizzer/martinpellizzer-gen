    "intro": "Paramachaerium krukovii, commonly known as the African grass or African feather grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions."
