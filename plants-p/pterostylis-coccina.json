It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in subtropical and temperate rainforests. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, showy, red or orange-flushed flower that resembles a helmet. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid blooms during spring and early summer, often in shaded, humid environments."
