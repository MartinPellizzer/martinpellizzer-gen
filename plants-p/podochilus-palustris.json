It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Podochilus palustris plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
