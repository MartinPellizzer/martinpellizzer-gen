    "intro": "Pleurothallis nanifolia, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, often clustered growth habit and produces delicate, small flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
