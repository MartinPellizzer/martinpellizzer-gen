    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. michauxii, commonly known as the eastern balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, grayish-bark that exudes a balsamic scent when scratched. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks. This variety is closely related to other Populus species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and stabilizing stream banks."
