    "intro": "Pinochia, commonly known as the sacred pine, is a unique botanical species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and a conical shape that resembles a pine tree. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are enclosed in woody cones. Pinochia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
