    "intro": "Pitcairnia brongniartiana var. scandens, commonly known as the scandens pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
