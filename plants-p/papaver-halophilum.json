    "intro": "Papaver halophilum, commonly known as the salt-loving poppy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and is adapted to thrive in saline environments. The plant has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Papaver halophilum is often found growing in salt marshes and along rocky shores where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
