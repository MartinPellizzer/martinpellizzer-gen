    "intro": "Pedicularis collettii var. nigra, commonly known as the black rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Tasmania. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
