It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color. Piper patens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shady conditions."
