    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. glabriflora, commonly known as the glabrous-flowered bulblet grass, is a variant of the bulblet grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its flowers are typically glabrous, meaning they lack the usual hairy covering found in many grasses. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
