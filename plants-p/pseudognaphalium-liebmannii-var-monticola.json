    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium liebmannii var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
