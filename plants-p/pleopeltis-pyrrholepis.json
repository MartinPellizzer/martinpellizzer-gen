    "intro": "Pleopeltis pyrrholepis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with distinctive red veins that contrast with its green coloration. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis pyrrholepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
