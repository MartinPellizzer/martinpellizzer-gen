    "intro": "Prasophyllum tortilis, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as heathlands and forest floors. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss. Prasophyllum tortilis is a low-growing plant that thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas."
