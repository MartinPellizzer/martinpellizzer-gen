    "intro": "Primula pistillaris, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring basal leaves that are narrowly elliptic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are characterized by a prominent, elongated pistil and five petals that are slightly reflexed at the edges. Primula pistillaris thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
