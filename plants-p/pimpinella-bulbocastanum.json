The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
