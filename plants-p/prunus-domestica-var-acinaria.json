    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. acinaria, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of white flowers in early spring. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The fruit, while tart, is used in jams, wines, and traditional medicines."
