    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive, cone-like fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in riparian habitats."
