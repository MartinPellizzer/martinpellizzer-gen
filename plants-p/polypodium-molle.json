    "intro": "Polypodium molle, commonly known as the soft polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, which are released when the fern matures."
