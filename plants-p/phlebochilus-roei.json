It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
