    "intro": "Psygmorchis pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a compact growth habit with a single, slender stem and a few narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
