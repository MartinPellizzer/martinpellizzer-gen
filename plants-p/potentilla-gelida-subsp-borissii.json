It thrives in cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. The plant features small, five-petaled white or yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in freezing conditions. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
