    "intro": "Phoebe pallida, commonly known as the pale phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, blue-black berries. Phoebe pallida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
