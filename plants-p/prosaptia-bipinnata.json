    "intro": "Prosaptia bipinnata, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Prosaptia bipinnata make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
