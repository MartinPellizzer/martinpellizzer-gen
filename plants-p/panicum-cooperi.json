    "intro": "Panicum cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces feathery, golden-brown seed heads that are visually striking and attract various pollinators. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. Cooper's panicgrass is often used in native plant landscapes due to its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
