    "intro": "Platantheroides cumminsiana, commonly known as the Cummins' twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears two small, white to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine woods and swampy areas. It has a short rootstock and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, it is considered endangered in many states."
