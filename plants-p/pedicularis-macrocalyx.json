    "intro": "Pedicularis macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and often hairy, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
