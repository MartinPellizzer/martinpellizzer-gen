    "intro": "Prenanthes dichotoma, commonly known as the twinleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
