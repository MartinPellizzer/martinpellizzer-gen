    "intro": "Pedicularis gruina var. typica, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble the fur of a golden monkey. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
