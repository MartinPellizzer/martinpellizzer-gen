    "intro": "Pinus monstrosa var. nesselrodiana, commonly known as the Nesselrode pine, is a rare and striking variant of the Colorado spruce. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted branches and a distinctive, gnarled appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety exhibits slow growth and can reach heights of up to 20 feet, with a conical to irregular shape. Its needles are dark green and slightly longer than those of the typical Colorado spruce, adding to its visual appeal. The plant is adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
