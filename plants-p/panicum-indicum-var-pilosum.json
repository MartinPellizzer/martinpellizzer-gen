It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
