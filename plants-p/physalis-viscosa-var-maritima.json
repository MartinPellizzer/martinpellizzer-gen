    "intro": "Physalis viscosa var. maritima, commonly known as the sea gooseberry, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in salty, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing numerous seeds. Its fruit, often referred to as a \"Chinese lantern,\" is edible when young but becomes tough and seedy as it matures. This species is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dune and beach habitats."
