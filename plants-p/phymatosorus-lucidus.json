    "intro": "Phymatosorus lucidus, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Phymatosorus lucidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
