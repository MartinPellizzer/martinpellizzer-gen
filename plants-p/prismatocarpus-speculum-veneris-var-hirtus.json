    "intro": "Prismatocarpus speculum-veneris var. hirtus, commonly known as the velvet-leafed moonseed, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
