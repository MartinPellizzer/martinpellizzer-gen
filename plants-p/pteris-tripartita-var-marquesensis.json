    "intro": "Pteris tripartita var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the forest floor. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
