    "intro": "Pinus san-rafaeliana, commonly known as the San Rafael pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces distinctive cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a subtropical climate with mild winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
