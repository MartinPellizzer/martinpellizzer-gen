    "intro": "Potentilla eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Potentilla eriocarpa is often found in open habitats like meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
