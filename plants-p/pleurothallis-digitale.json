    "intro": "Pleurothallis digitale, commonly known as the digitate pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of forests. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is characterized by its unique morphology, including the presence of a short, slender stem and specialized root structures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its native environment."
