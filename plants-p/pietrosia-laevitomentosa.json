    "intro": "Pietrosia laevitomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pietrosia laevitomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
