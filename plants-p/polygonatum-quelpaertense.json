    "intro": "Polygonatum quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly Jeju Island. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous stem and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow-green flowers followed by red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
