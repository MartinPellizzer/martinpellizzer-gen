It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pleroma oreophilum thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
