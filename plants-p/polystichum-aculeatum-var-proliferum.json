    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. proliferum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
