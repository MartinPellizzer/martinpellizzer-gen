    "intro": "Pyrostria brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed fern, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and marshes, preferring moist and acidic soils. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and often form a rosette at the base, while its flowering structures are small and inconspicuous. Pyrostria brunnescens plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
