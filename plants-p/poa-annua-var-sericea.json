    "intro": "Poa annua var. sericea, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which give it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and durability."
