    "intro": "Polypodium polypodioides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
