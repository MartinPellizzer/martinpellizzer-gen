    "intro": "Puccinellia festuciformis subsp. convoluta, commonly known as curled puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in saline or alkaline environments. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes."
