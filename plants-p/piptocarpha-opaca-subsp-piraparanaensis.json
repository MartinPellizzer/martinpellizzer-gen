    "intro": "Piptocarpha opaca subsp. piraparanaensis, commonly known as the Piraparana thistle, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
