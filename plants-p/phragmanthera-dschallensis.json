    "intro": "Phragmanthera dschallensis, commonly known as the Dschallens mountain orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly ornate floral structures. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
