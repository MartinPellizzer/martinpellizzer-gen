    "intro": "Primula elatior var. intricata, commonly known as the intricate primrose, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, dark green leaves that are often mottled or speckled. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early blooming period."
