    "intro": "Pistacia occidentalis, commonly known as the western pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into 5\u20139 leaflets, and its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a small, green drupe. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic hard, woody fruit that matures to a dark purple color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The western pistache is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its edible nuts and medicinal properties."
