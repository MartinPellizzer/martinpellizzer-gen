    "intro": "Prescottia stricta, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Prescottia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh desert conditions."
