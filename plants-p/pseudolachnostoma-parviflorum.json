    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered pseudolachnostoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
