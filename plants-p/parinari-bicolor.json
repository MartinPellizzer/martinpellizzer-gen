    "intro": "Parinari bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored parinari, is a tropical tree native to Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored leaves, with the upper surface being dark green and the underside lighter in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Parinari bicolor is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
