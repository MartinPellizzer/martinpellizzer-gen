    "intro": "Prunus undulata f. microbotrys, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or miniature cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, providing a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in late summer. It is valued for its compact size and ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Prunus undulata, distinguished by its smaller size and dense foliage."
