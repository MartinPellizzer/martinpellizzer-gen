    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa subsp. washoensis, commonly known as the Wasco pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire. The needles are typically longer than those of other ponderosa pine subspecies, and the cones are large and woody. This subspecies thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
