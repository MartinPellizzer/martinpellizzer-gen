    "intro": "Perilimnastes fruticosa, commonly known as the water thimble, is a small shrub native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
