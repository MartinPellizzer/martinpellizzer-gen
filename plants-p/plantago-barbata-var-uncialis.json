    "intro": "Plantago barbata var. uncialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. This variety is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
