    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. digitata, commonly known as the alpine hair grass, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three flowering glumes. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Poa alpina subsp. digitata plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
