    "intro": "Poa eminens, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa eminens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine ecosystems."
