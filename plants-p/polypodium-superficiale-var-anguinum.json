    "intro": "Polypodium superficiale var. anguinum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage. It features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
