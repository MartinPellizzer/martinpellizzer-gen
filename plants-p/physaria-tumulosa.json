    "intro": "Physaria tumulosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with hairy, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and habitat restoration in desert regions."
