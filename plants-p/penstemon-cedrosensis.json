    "intro": "Penstemon cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
