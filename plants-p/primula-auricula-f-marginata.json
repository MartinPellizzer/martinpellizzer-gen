    "intro": "Primula auricula f. marginata, commonly known as the margined auricula, is a hybrid cultivar of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-like flowers that are typically pink or purple with a yellow center. The plant is a perennial herb native to the British Isles and thrives in cool, moist environments. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, fertile soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrasting margins on its petals, which give it a unique visual appeal."
