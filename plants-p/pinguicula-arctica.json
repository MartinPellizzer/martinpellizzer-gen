    "intro": "Pinguicula arctica, commonly known as the Arctic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Arctic regions. It possesses sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, often in areas with low temperatures and short growing seasons. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Pinguicula arctica is a low-growing plant that plays a unique ecological role in its cold, alpine ecosystem."
