    "intro": "Pyrrosia heteractis, commonly known as the heteractis fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often display a distinctive veining pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia heteractis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
