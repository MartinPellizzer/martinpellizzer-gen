    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa subsp. hypolasia, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
