    "intro": "Pterostylis praetermissa, commonly known as the Missed Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flower spike that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant has a single, slender, erect stem with a single flower at the top, which is surrounded by two narrow, leaf-like structures. Its flowers are usually less than 2 cm in length and have a distinctive, elongated labellum. Pterostylis praetermissa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys."
