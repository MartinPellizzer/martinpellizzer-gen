    "intro": "Portulaca tingoensis, commonly known as the Tingo Portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions. Portulaca tingoensis is often found in rocky crevices and along dry riverbeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
