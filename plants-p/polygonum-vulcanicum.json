    "intro": "Polygonum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic knotweed, is a perennial herb native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils, often found in areas with recent volcanic activity. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and sometimes branched. Polygonum vulcanicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed volcanic landscapes."
