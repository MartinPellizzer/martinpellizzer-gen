    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris remota, commonly known as the remote water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, narrow segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pseudocystopteris remota is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
