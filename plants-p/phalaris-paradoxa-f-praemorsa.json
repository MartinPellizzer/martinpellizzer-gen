    "intro": "Phalaris paradoxa f. praemorsa, commonly known as the death camas, is a striking plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a monocot belonging to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking purple or pinkish spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of certain alkaloids. It is native to western North America and often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
