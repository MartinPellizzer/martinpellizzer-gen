    "intro": "Parthenium elliotanum, commonly known as Elliot's ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, and it is known for its high allergenic potential due to the fine, wind-dispersed pollen it releases. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a distinctive bitter taste. Elliot's ragweed is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
