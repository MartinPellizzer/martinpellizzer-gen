    "intro": "Pueraria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pueraria, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Pueraria ferruginea is valued for its traditional medicinal uses and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
