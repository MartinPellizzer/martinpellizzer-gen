    "intro": "Pisonia elliptica, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pisonia elliptica is also known for its fibrous bark, which has been used traditionally in some cultures for its durability and versatility."
