    "intro": "Purkayasthaea, commonly known as the Indian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that often display a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Purkayasthaea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists. They require specific environmental conditions to thrive, including high humidity and indirect sunlight."
