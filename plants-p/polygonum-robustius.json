    "intro": "Polygonum robustius, commonly known as the robust knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its stems are often reddish and covered with fine hairs, while its leaves are lanceolate with a slightly serrated margin. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by three-lobed seed capsules that disperse seeds by wind."
