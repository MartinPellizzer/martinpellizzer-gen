It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous thin, wiry stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, with five to seven lobes, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" Picris flexuosa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
