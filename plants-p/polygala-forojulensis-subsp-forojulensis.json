It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
