    "intro": "Phyllorkis occlusa, commonly known as the closed leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark gray, with a finely granular texture and a slight powdery appearance. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, including usnic acid, which contributes to its chemical complexity. This lichen is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments on tree bark and stone."
