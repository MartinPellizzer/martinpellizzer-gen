    "intro": "Parodia rostrum-sperma, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its name \"rostrum-sperma\" refers to the shape of its flowers, which resemble a beak or horn. This cactus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
