    "intro": "Polyadenia, commonly known as the \"false nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to the Americas, particularly South America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. They produce pods that contain seeds, and some species are adapted to grow in dry, disturbed habitats. The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
