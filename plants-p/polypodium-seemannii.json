    "intro": "Polypodium seemannii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Polypodium seemannii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
