    "intro": "Pneumatopteris petrophila, commonly known as the rock brake, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common to most ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
