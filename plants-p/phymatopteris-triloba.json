    "intro": "Phymatopteris triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil."
