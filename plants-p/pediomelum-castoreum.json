    "intro": "Pediomelum castoreum, commonly known as the castor bean plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is most famous for its seeds, which contain a toxic oil called ricin, making it both dangerous and valuable in industrial applications. Due to its toxicity, it is often grown as an ornamental plant rather than for its seeds."
