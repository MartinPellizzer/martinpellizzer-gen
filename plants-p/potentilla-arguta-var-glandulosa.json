    "intro": "Potentilla arguta var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
