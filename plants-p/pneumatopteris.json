    "intro": "Pneumatopteris, commonly known as the air fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often hairy fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The fronds of Pneumatopteris are usually pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a feather. They have a unique ability to absorb moisture through their leaves, which is why they are often referred to as air ferns. This genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value."
