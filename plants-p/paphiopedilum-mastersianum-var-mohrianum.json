    "intro": "Paphiopedilum mastersianum var. mohrianum, commonly known as the Mohrian mottled orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and intricate, showy flowers with a unique pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, are highly prized in horticulture for their beauty and rarity. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
