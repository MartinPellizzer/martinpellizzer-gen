    "intro": "Physaria bellii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual plant with hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Physaria bellii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
