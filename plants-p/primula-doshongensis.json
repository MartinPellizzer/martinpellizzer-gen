    "intro": "Primula doshongensis, commonly known as the Doshong primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are often borne on short pedicels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
