    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare and ancient aquatic fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, typically with a single central vein. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
