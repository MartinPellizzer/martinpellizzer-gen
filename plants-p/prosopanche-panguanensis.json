    "intro": "Prosopanche panguanensis, commonly known as the Panguan ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Yunnan province of China. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant is known for its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. It has very specific ecological requirements, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native region."
