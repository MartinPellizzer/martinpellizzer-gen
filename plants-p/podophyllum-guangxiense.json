    "intro": "Podophyllum guangxiense, commonly known as Guangxi podophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi, China. It belongs to the family Podophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
