    "intro": "Plantago amblyacme, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
