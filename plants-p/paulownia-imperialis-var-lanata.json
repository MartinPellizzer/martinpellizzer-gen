It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in late spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its rapid growth and lightweight, strong wood, making it useful in woodworking and as an ornamental plant."
