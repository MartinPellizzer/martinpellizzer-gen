    "intro": "Physalis frutescens, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, orange to red calyx that encloses the small, edible berries. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The berries, which are rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, are typically harvested when fully colored and slightly firm. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
