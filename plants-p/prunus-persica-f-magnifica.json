    "intro": "Prunus persica f. magnifica, commonly known as the Persian plum or royal plum, is a distinctive cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its large, showy flowers. It is prized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink blooms that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The fruit, while edible, is smaller and less sweet compared to typical peaches, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes than culinary use."
