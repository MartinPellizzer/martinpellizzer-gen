    "intro": "Poa parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian grass, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Poa parnassica thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. It is a hardy species adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrient availability."
