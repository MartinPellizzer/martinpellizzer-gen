    "intro": "Pteroceras phalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in swampy areas with high humidity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
