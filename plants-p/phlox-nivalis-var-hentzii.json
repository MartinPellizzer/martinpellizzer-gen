    "intro": "Phlox nivalis var. hentzii, commonly known as the Hentz's snow phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
