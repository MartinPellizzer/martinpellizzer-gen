    "intro": "Psychotria avakubiensis, commonly known as the Kikuyu arrow poison, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, and grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant is notable for its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, which have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it is of interest to botanists and ethnobotanists alike."
