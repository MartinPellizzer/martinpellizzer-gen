    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. macrophyllum, commonly known as broad-leaved field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and in wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces dark brown, three-sided berries. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
