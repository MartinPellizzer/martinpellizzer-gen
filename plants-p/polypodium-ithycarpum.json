    "intro": "Polypodium ithycarpum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
