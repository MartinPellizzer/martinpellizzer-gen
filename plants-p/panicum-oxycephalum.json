    "intro": "Panicum oxycephalum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-green flowers in the summer, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland edge habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits, it is valued in both landscaping and restoration projects."
