    "intro": "Poa celebica, commonly known as the Celebes bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the Indonesian island of Celebes. It is a low-growing perennial plant with fine, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Poa celebica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
