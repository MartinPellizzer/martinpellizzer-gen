    "intro": "Polygonum humirepens, commonly known as the swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist environments where it can thrive in saturated soils. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are often overlooked. Polygonum humirepens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
