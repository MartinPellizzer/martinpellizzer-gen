    "intro": "Panicum rupestre, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, reddish-purple foliage and delicate, feather-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant color and drought tolerance, which make it suitable for low-maintenance landscapes. Panicum rupestre is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry, rocky environments."
