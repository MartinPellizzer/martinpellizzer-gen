    "intro": "Peniocereus viperinus, commonly known as the night-blooming star cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
