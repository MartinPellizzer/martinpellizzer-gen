    "intro": "Pandanus korrensis, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its roots are valued for their medicinal properties. Pandanus korrensis thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, humid environments."
