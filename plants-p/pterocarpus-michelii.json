    "intro": "Pterocarpus michelii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The tree has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
