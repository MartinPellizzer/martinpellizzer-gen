    "intro": "Ptilotus humifusus, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to Australia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its leaves are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ptilotus humifusus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
