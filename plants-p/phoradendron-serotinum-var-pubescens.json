    "intro": "Phoradendron serotinum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruits, contributing to its spread across different host species. The plant's parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host, often causing minor to moderate damage to the host tree."
