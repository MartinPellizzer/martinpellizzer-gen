    "intro": "Peltophorus goaensis, commonly known as the Goa burr or Goa thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in the coastal regions of Goa and parts of southern India. The plant is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils."
