    "intro": "Pimpinella trifoliata, commonly known as three-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps that separate upon maturity. Pimpinella trifoliata is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich habitats."
