    "intro": "Polystichum molle, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
