    "intro": "Polystichum hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
