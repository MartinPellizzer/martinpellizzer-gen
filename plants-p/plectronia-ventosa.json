    "intro": "Plectronia ventosa, commonly known as the windflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Plectronia ventosa thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its lightweight seeds are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its common name and ecological role in its native environment."
