    "intro": "Pothos coriaceus, commonly known as the Satin Pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that have a smooth, almost velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers, though it is rarely seen in cultivation. Its stems are flexible and can climb or trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. Pothos coriaceus is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in indirect light and requiring minimal water."
