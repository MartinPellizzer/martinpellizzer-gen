    "intro": "Peucedanum brachystylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native environment."
