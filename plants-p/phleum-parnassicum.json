    "intro": "Phleum parnassicum, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, two-lobed flowers. Phleum parnassicum is valued for its role in ecological systems and as a forage plant for livestock."
