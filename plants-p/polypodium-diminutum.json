    "intro": "Polypodium diminutum, commonly known as the small wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium diminutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
