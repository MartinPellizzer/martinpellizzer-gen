    "intro": "Polystichum herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum herbaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
