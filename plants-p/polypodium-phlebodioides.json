    "intro": "Polypodium phlebodioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. The fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in rows along the underside of the leaves."
