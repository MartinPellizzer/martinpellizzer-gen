    "intro": "Ptelea tomentosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silky appearance. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds. Ptelea tomentosa is often found in moist, woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
