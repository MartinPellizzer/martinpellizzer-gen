It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
