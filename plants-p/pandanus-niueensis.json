    "intro": "Pandanus niueensis, commonly known as the Niue pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Niue in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the apex of the leaves. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself thrives in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soil. Pandanus niueensis is an important species for both ecological and cultural reasons in its native habitat."
