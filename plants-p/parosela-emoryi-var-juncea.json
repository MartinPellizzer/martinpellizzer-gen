    "intro": "Parosela emoryi var. juncea, commonly known as the Emory's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
