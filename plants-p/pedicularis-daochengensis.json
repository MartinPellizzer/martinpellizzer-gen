    "intro": "Pedicularis daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng lousewort, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
