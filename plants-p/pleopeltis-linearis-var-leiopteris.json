    "intro": "Pleopeltis linearis var. leiopteris, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a variant of the linear pleopeltis species. It is a tropical fern that typically grows on shaded, moist rock faces or tree trunks in humid environments. The plant features long, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky or epiphytic habitats, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
