    "intro": "Palmeria pulchra, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
