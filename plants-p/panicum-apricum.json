    "intro": "Panicum apricum, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Panicum apricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
