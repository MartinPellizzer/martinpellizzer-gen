It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with white spines, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
