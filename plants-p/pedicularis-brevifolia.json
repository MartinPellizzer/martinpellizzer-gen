    "intro": "Pedicularis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, ovate, and arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Pedicularis brevifolia is often found growing in rocky soils and is a popular subject in botanical gardens and alpine flora studies."
