    "intro": "Polypodium hillii, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on cliffs and rocky outcrops, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture. Polypodium hillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
