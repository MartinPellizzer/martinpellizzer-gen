It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and a unique floral structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Native to a limited geographic region, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with high humidity. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
