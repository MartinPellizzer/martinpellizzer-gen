    "intro": "Phalacrocarpum oppositifolium subsp. hoffmannseggii, commonly known as the Hoffmannsegg\u2019s false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features basal rosettes of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of greenish-yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is typically a corymb, and the flowers are borne on short pedicels. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of P. oppositifolium."
