    "intro": "Physalis versicolor, commonly known as the goldenberry or Inca berry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruit that encases the true berries. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The fruit is often consumed raw or used in culinary applications due to its sweet, tangy flavor."
