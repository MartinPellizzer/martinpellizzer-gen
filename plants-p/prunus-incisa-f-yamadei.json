    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. yamadei, commonly known as the Yamadei cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Due to its unique foliage and seasonal color changes, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
