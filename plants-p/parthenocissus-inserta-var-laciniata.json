    "intro": "Parthenocissus inserta var. laciniata, commonly known as the dissected ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Its strong, flexible stems allow it to cling to walls, trees, and trellises with tendrils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover vertical surfaces."
