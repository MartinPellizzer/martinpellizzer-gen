    "intro": "Pseudostellaria jamesiana, commonly known as the James's starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many herbaceous plants with showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
