    "intro": "Pinus strobiformis, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and woody. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing the seeds. This species is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
