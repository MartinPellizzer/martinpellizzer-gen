    "intro": "Picea orientalis f. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green fir, is a variant of the oriental fir, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its needle-like leaves are short and stout, contributing to its compact, conical shape. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. It produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding visual interest in the winter months."
