    "intro": "Poa senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and arid regions. Poa senegalensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in ecological restoration projects."
