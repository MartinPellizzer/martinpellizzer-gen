    "intro": "Pleurothallis duartei, commonly known as the Duarte's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, Pleurothallis duartei is relatively rare and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
