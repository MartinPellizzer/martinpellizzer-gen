    "intro": "Pericalypta, commonly known as the \"sac-like flower\" or \"bottle-shaped plant,\" is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often tubular or sac-like floral bracts that enclose the actual flowers. These bracts are typically brightly colored and serve as an attractive feature for pollinators. The plant's structure is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized morphology and role in its native ecosystems."
