    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. multiflora, commonly known as the Meadow Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawn grass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and fine texture. This variety is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural habitats."
