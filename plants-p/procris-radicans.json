    "intro": "Procris radicans, commonly known as the trailing ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue or purple and bloom in the spring. Procris radicans is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
