    "intro": "Polygonum tumidum, commonly known as the swollen knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its stout, cylindrical stems that often appear swollen at the nodes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Polygonum tumidum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows."
