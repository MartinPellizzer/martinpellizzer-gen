    "intro": "Pteris madagascarica var. madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant's unique luminescence is due to the presence of certain compounds in its leaves, which react to moisture and darkness."
