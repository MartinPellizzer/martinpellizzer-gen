    "intro": "Piptocoma vernonioides, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
