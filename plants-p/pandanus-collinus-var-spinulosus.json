    "intro": "Pandanus collinus var. spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in small, spiny projections. The plant produces branched inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional weaving and basket-making by indigenous communities. The spiny varietal trait is a distinguishing feature that helps in identifying this particular form of the pandanus species."
