    "intro": "Prunus brigantina var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that appear in early spring, contrasting with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
