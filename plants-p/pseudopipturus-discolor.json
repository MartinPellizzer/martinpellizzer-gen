It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnately compound, with a yellowish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Pseudopipturus discolor plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
