    "intro": "Phymatopteris daweishanensis, commonly known as the Daweishan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
