    "intro": "Pinus alba var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic white pine, is a rare and cold-hardy variant of the white pine species. It is native to the Arctic regions of North America and is adapted to harsh, subarctic climates. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight. Its needles are shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species, which helps reduce water loss in cold environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in extreme conditions."
