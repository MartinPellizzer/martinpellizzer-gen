    "intro": "Polypodium montigenus, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. This fern is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients."
