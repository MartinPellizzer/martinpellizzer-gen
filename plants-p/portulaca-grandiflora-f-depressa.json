    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
