    "intro": "Polypodium membranaceum var. carinatum, commonly known as the ridge-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The varietal name 'carinatum' refers to the distinct ridge or keel-like structure on the fronds, which is a key identifying feature."
