    "intro": "Physalis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky physalis, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of orange-yellow berries enclosed in a papery calyx, resembling a small lantern. These berries are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
