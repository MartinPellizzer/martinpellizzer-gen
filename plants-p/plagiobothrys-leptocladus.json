It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It is an annual or biennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
