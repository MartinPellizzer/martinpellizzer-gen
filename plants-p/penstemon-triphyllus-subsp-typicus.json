    "intro": "Penstemon triphyllus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
