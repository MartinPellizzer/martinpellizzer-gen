    "intro": "Paraboea pyroliflora, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Paraboea pyroliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
