    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. humile, commonly known as little bluestem, is a low-growing grass species native to North America. It features fine, blue-green blades that turn coppery red in the fall, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy seeds. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its ecological value is further enhanced by its ability to reseed itself naturally in suitable environments."
