    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi subsp. heteroglossa, commonly known as the yellow labellum orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
