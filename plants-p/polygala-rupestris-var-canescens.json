    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
