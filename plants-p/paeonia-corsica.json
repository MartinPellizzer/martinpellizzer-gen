It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Paeonia corsica plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a subject of conservation efforts due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes."
