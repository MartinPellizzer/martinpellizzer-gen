    "intro": "Papaver rupestre, commonly known as the rock poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Papaver rupestre is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
