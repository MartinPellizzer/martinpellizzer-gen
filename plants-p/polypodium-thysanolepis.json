    "intro": "Polypodium thysanolepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
