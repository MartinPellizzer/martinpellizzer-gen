    "intro": "Pistia africana, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it spreads through vegetative reproduction. Pistia africana is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats and can become invasive in non-native environments."
