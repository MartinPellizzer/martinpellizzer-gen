    "intro": "Phaseolaster praetermissa, commonly known as the slender phaseolus, is a climbing legume native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb supports in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
