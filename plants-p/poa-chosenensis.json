    "intro": "Poa chosenensis, commonly known as the Chosen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
