    "intro": "Pseudowolffia monodii, commonly known as the minute water clover, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Wolffia. It is one of the smallest flowering plants in the world, with individual plants measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its structure consists of a small, floating leaf that supports a single, minute flower. Pseudowolffia monodii reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, where new plants develop from the parent plant without the need for seeds."
