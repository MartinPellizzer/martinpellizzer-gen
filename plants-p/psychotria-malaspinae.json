It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Psychotria malaspinae is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
