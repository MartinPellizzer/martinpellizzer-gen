    "intro": "Panisea tricallosa var. garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's panisea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
