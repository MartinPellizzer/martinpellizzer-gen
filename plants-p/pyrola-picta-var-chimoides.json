It features whorled leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are pink to reddish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its aromatic leaves and berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
