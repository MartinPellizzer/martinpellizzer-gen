    "intro": "Phyteuma latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet-blue or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens and borders."
