    "intro": "Paspalum fasciculatum var. paraguayense, commonly known as Paraguay grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This grass is often used in erosion control and as forage for livestock due to its hardiness and adaptability."
