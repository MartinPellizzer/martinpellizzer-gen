    "intro": "Prosthechea lambda, commonly known as the lambda orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive triangular shape. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical study. Prosthechea lambda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
