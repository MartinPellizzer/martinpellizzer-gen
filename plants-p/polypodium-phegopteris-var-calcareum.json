    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. calcareum, commonly known as the calcareous shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, particularly on limestone, which gives it its common name. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
