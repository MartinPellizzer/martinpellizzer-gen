    "intro": "Potentilla pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pindus Mountains in northern Greece. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in groups of five. Its leaves are typically rounded and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. Potentilla pindicola is well-suited for rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
