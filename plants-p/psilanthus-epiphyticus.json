    "intro": "Psilanthus epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic psilanthus, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces unique, fragrant flowers that are often clustered together. Its reproductive structures are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Psilanthus epiphyticus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
