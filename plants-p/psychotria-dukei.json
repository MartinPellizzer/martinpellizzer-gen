    "intro": "Psychotria dukei, commonly known as the Duke's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Psychotria dukei is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
