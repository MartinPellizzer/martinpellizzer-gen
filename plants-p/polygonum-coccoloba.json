    "intro": "Polygonum coccoloba, commonly known as the American groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible, cherry-like fruits that are typically harvested when they turn red and begin to split open. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Polygonum coccoloba is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
