    "intro": "Pedicularis roseialba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which attracts pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
