    "intro": "Psychotria speluncae subsp. exserta, commonly known as the cave psychotria, is a rare tropical plant species native to the humid, shaded environments of cave systems in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant thrives in high humidity and low light conditions, making it a unique inhabitant of subterranean ecosystems. Its growth is often restricted to specific microhabitats within caves, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental disturbances and habitat loss."
