    "intro": "Priva dentata, commonly known as the toothed privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often serrated or toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Priva dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
