    "intro": "Parodia haselbergii f. albiseta, commonly known as the White Ghost Cactus, is a unique and rare hybrid of the Parodia genus. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often with a pale or white coloration. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, green fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a striking addition to arid gardens. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
