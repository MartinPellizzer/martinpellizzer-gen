    "intro": "Pilea peltata var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the Shiny Shamrock, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and the varietal name \"ovatifolia\" refers to its ovate (egg-shaped) foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stems, though it is primarily grown for its attractive leaves rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
