It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
