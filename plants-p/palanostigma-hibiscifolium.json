It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of hibiscus plants, hence its common name. The tree produces yellow flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
