    "intro": "Populus italica, commonly known as Italian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental and reforestation purposes."
