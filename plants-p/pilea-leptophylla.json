    "intro": "Pilea leptophylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to eastern China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its round, succulent leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea leptophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
