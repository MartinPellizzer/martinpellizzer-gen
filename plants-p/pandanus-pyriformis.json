    "intro": "Pandanus pyriformis, commonly known as the canoe pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its fruit, known as a \"breadfruit,\" is edible and has been a staple food in many island cultures. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
