    "intro": "Pneumatopteris costata, commonly known as the costate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, linear segments with a serrated margin. Pneumatopteris costata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
