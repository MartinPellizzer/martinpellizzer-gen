    "intro": "Pothos chinensis var. lotienensis, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more prized for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to purify air and its easy maintenance further contribute to its widespread cultivation."
