    "intro": "Polypodium annamense, commonly known as the Annam fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is extensively branched and produces numerous fertile and sterile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
