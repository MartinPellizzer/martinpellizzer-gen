    "intro": "Pterophylla eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats."
