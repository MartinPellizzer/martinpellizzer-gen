    "intro": "Podandrogyne orba, commonly known as the red-flowered sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same individual, a trait known as andromonoecy. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The showy red or pink flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
