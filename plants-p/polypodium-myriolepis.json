    "intro": "Polypodium myriolepis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a thick, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. Polypodium myriolepis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
