    "intro": "Psilothamnus ericifolius, commonly known as the coastal heath or coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its foliage composed of small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Psilothamnus ericifolius is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
