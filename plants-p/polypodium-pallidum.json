It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pallidum is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
