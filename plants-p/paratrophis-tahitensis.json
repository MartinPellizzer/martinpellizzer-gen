    "intro": "Paratrophis tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian paratrophis, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
