    "intro": "Phyllorkis vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Phyllorkis vermicularis is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
