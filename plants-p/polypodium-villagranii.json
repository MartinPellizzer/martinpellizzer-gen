    "intro": "Polypodium villagranii, commonly known as the Mexican wall fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, trailing growth habit."
