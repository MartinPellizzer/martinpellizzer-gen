It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and linear, with a slight pubescence. The species is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
