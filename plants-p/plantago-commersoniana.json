It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
