    "intro": "Proboscidea parviflora subsp. sinaloensis, commonly known as the Sinaloan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
