It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Phalacrodiscus monspeliensis is often found in coastal areas and is well-suited to Mediterranean climates."
