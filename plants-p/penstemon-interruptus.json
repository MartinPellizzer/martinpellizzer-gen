    "intro": "Penstemon interruptus, commonly known as the tall bearded penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon interruptus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
