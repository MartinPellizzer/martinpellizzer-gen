    "intro": "Pyrola elegantula, commonly known as the elegant wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features whorled leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Pyrola elegantula is well adapted to acidic, shaded environments and is often found in moist, forested areas."
