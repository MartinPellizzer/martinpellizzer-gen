    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by oval, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and floodplains. This variety is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used for reforestation and erosion control."
