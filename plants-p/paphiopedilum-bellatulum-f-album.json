    "intro": "Paphiopedilum bellatulum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale white petals and sepals, which contrast with its deep red or brown lip, creating a visually arresting appearance. This orchid is a terrestrial species, often growing in shaded, humid forest environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited natural habitat and rarity, it is considered a valuable and delicate species in botanical collections."
