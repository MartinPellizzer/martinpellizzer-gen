    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria f. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit. It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its flattened, prostrate stems, which set it apart from the upright form of the species."
