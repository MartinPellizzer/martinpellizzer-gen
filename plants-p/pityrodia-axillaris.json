    "intro": "Pityrodia axillaris, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along coastal dunes. Pityrodia axillaris is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to harsh coastal conditions."
