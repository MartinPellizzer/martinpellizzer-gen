    "intro": "Pteris zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found near streams or in moist forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris zollingeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
