It is characterized by its distinctive, often irregularly shaped fruits that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant is a deciduous tree with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, glossy leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by the characteristic pear-shaped fruits. This form is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruit."
