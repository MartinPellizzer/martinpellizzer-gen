It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its showy, hibiscus-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, while its flowers are usually pink or red in color. Due to habitat loss and limited research, the conservation status of Peiranisia benitoensis remains uncertain."
