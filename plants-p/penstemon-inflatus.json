    "intro": "Penstemon inflatus, commonly known as the inflated beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant produces distinctive, inflated bracts that give it its common name and help protect its seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Penstemon inflatus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
