It features slender, hollow stems that often have a reddish hue and are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance that aids in identification. This species is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas."
