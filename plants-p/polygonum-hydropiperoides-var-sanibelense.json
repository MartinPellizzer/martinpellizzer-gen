    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiperoides var. sanibelense, commonly known as Sanibel knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Florida Keys. It features upright, branching stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to saline and brackish conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
