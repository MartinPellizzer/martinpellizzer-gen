    "intro": "Platycaulos acutus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved flatstem, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, sharp tip, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Platycaulos acutus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
