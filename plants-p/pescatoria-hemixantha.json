    "intro": "Pescatoria hemixantha, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pescatoria hemixantha plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
