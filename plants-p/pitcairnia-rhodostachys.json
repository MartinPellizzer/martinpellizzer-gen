    "intro": "Pitcairnia rhodostachys, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and striking red inflorescence that emerges from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia rhodostachys is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
