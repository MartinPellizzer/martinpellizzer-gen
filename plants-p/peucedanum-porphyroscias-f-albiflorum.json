    "intro": "Peucedanum porphyroscias f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered cow parsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is a variant of Peucedanum porphyroscias, characterized by its pale or white flowers as opposed to the typical purple or pink hues of the species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
