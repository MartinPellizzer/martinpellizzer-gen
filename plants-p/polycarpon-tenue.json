    "intro": "Polycarpon tenue, commonly known as slender sandparsley, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It has thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Polycarpon tenue is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
