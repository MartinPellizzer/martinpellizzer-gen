It is a compact, clump-forming plant with slender, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are borne on a spadix, typical of the Aroid family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
