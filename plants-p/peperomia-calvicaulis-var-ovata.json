It features glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
