    "intro": "Pronephrium trachyphyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf bladderworts, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving water bodies. The plant has small, green, often submerged leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Pronephrium trachyphyllum is notable for its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms, which it uses as a nutrient source."
