    "intro": "Piranhea longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It features elongated, slender stems that often trail across the water's surface or hang from the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from long, flexible peduncles. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for floating or submerged growth in aquatic environments. It is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
