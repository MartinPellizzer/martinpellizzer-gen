    "intro": "Potentilla adenophylla var. umbellata, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
