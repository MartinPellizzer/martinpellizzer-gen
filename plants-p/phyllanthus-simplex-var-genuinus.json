    "intro": "Phyllanthus simplex var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bead-like, greenish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
