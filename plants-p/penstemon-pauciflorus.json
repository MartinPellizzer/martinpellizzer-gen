    "intro": "Penstemon pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, dark seeds in its showy flower clusters. Penstemon pauciflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
