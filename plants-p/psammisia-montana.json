    "intro": "Psammisia montana, commonly known as the mountain sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Psammisia montana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
