    "intro": "Pulsatilla recta, commonly known as the straight pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with numerous stamens and a central pistil. Pulsatilla recta is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
