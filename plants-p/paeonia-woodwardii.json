    "intro": "Paeonia woodwardii, commonly known as the Woodward peony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and allow the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Paeonia woodwardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and historical significance."
