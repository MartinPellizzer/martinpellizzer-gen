    "intro": "Phleum phleoides var. glabrispiculatum, commonly known as the smooth-spurred fescue, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, dense hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical arrangements. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) awns, which set it apart from other varieties of Phleum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands."
