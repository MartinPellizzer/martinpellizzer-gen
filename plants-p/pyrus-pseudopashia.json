    "intro": "Pyrus pseudopashia, commonly known as the Tibetan white pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
