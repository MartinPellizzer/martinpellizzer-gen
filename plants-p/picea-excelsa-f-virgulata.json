    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. virgulata, commonly known as the slender white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce, characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The foliage is typically dense and dark green, with small, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its elegant, upright shape. It is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
