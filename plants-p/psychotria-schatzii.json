It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Psychotria schatzii is often found in humid, shaded understory environments of tropical forests."
