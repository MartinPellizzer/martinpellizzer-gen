    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion viscosulum, commonly known as the sticky lysimachia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
