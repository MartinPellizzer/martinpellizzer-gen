    "intro": "Psychotria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it produces small, dark blue to black berries. Psychotria stenophylla is often found in association with epiphytic growth on trees, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
