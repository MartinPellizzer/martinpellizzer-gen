    "intro": "Pellegrinia parvifolia, commonly known as the silver dust plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
