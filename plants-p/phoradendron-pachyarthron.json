It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host tree through its haustellum, while it also performs photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. Its berries are an important food source for various bird species."
