    "intro": "Polygala turgida, commonly known as the swollen milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
