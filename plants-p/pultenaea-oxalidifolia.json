    "intro": "Pultenaea oxalidifolia, commonly known as the oxalidifoliate bush pea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions such as Western Australia and South Australia. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces flattened, fibrous pods that contain seeds. Pultenaea oxalidifolia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
