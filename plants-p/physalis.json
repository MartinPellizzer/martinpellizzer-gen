    "intro": "Physalis, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or Cape gooseberry, is a genus of about 75 species of flowering plants in the nightshade family. These plants are characterized by their distinctive papery calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small lantern. The fruit, often orange or red, is typically edible and contains a sweet, tangy pulp with numerous seeds. Physalis species are native to the Americas but are now cultivated in various parts of the world. They are often grown for their ornamental value as well as for their edible fruits."
