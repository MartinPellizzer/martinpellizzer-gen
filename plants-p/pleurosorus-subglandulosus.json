It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its distinctive glandular features, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
