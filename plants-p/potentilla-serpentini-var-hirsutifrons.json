    "intro": "Potentilla serpentini var. hirsutifrons, commonly known as the Hirsute-fronded Cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is closely related to other members of the Potentilla genus, sharing similar morphological traits."
