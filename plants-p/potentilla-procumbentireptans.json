    "intro": "Potentilla procumbentireptans, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Potentilla procumbentireptans is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
