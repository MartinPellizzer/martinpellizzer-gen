    "intro": "Pithocarpa pulchella var. melanostigma, commonly known as the black-stemmed pithocarpa, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, typical of many desert plants. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
