    "intro": "Pentagonia imparipinnata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in moist, tropical environments. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting."
