    "intro": "Puccinellia coarctata subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern narrowleaf puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
