    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. sumbavensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Sumbawa Island in Indonesia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, fibrous leaves that grow in a dense, fan-like arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by the development of fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The species exhibits a robust growth habit, making it well-suited for humid, tropical climates."
