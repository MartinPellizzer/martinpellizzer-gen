    "intro": "Peperomia tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tenuiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
