    "intro": "Parahebe senex, commonly known as the silverleaf parahebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive silver-gray hue due to the presence of fine, fuzzy hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants."
