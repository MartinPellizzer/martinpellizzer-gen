    "intro": "Phoradendron falcifolium, commonly known as the Mexican devil's ivy, is a species of mistletoe native to Central America. It is an hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to a host tree and derives some of its nutrients from it while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small white or pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries. This species is often found growing on the branches of trees such as oaks and ceiba in tropical and subtropical regions."
