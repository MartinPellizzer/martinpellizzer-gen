    "intro": "Phyllanthus sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappa's spurge, is a shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
