    "intro": "Physocarpus alternans var. panamintensis, commonly known as the Panamint ninebark, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. This species is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
