    "intro": "Poliothyrsis sinensis f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed Chinese holly, is a variant of the Chinese holly characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to China, typically found in forested regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and lack the hairy texture of the typical species. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping and traditional Chinese gardens."
