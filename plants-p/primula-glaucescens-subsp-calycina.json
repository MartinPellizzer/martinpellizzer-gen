The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation efforts."
