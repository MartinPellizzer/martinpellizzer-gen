    "intro": "Praravinia, commonly known as the slender swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Praravinia thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its wetland environment."
