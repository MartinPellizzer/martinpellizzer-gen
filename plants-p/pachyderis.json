    "intro": "Pachyderis, commonly known as the African rock python, is a large, non-venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a member of the family Boidae and is characterized by its thick, muscular body and distinctive pattern of dark and light crossbands. The plant name Pachyderis is actually a genus of flowering plants, not a snake, and is part of the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees with hairy stems and showy flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in disturbed habitats."
