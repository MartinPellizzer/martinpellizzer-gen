    "intro": "Phylloboea, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
