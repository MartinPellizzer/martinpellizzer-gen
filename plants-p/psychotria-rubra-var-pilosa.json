It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found in rainforests and is known for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. However, it is also noted for containing psychoactive compounds, making it of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
