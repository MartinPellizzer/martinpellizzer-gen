    "intro": "Pelexia cerina, commonly known as the hairy pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pelexia cerina is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is often associated with rich, organic soil. It is a relatively short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
