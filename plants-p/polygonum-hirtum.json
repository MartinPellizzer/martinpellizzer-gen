    "intro": "Polygonum hirtum, commonly known as hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, hairy, and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp environments. Polygonum hirtum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
