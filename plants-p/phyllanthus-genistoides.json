    "intro": "Phyllanthus genistoides, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and narrow, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
