    "intro": "Pseudocimum trichocalyx, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. The seeds are rich in nutrients and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
