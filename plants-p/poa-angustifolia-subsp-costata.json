    "intro": "Poa angustifolia subsp. costata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, with a distinctive ribbed or costate appearance on the leaf surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
