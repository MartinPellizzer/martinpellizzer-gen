    "intro": "Polystachya epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, elongated inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
