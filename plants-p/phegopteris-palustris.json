    "intro": "Phegopteris palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Phegopteris palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
