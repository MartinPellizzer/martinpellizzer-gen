    "intro": "Polygala isaloensis, commonly known as the Isole Mountain milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which is characterized by its distinctive floral structures and often intricate pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in the unique ecological conditions of the island's high-altitude regions. Its small, delicate flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Polygala isaloensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving Madagascar's unique flora."
