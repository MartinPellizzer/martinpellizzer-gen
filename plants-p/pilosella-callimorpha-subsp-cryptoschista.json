    "intro": "Pilosella callimorpha subsp. cryptoschista, commonly known as the cryptoschist pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
