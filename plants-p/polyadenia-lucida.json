    "intro": "Polyadenia lucida, commonly known as the shiningleaf or whitebeard plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the southeastern United States. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma. The plant's most distinctive feature is its showy, white, velvety bracts that surround the flower clusters, which are often mistaken for petals."
