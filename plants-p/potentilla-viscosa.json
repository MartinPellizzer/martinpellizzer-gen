    "intro": "Potentilla viscosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils in open woodlands or stream banks. Potentilla viscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
