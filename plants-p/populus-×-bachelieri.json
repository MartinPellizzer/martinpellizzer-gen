    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 bachelieri, commonly known as the Weeping Poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a unique, almost weeping appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures."
