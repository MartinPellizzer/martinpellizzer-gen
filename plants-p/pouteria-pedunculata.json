    "intro": "Pouteria pedunculata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by bees. The tree bears elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds, which are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. Its fruit has a fibrous outer layer and a hard shell enclosing the seeds. Pouteria pedunculata plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest."
