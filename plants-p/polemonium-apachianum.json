    "intro": "Polemonium apachianum, commonly known as the Apache bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
