    "intro": "Prasophyllum colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's leek orchid, is an endemic species native to the wetlands of Tasmania. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged areas, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often resembling a leek in appearance, which gives it its common name. Prasophyllum colensoi is a rare and protected species, reflecting its ecological significance in Tasmania's flora."
