It is characterized by its unique, striking red eyespots on the leaves, which are actually specialized structures called pseudostems. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub with thick, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
