    "intro": "Polygonum oxyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, pink to red flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Polygonum oxyphyllum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland health."
