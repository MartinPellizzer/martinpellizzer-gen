    "intro": "Phyteuma spicatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrum\" suggests a smoother texture compared to other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
