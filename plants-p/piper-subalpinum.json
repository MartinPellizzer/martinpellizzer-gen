    "intro": "Piper subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. It is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, typically found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. The plant produces small, green berries that are often used in traditional Andean medicine. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds similar to those found in black pepper. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
