It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in gypsum, which contributes to its common name. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Perymenium gypsophilum is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, showcasing its resilience in harsh environments."
