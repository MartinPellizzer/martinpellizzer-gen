    "intro": "Primula boni-auxilii subsp. sellae, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. It is well-adapted to high-altitude conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
