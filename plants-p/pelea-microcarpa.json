    "intro": "Pelea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf pelea, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Pelea microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
