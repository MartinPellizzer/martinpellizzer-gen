    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided, dark green fronds that have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape. The velvet fern is also notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
