    "intro": "Pleurogramme seminuda, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that may aid in attracting small organisms."
