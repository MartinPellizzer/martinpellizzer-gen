    "intro": "Polystichum incisum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polystichum incisum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
