    "intro": "Parathesis montana, commonly known as the mountain parathesis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
