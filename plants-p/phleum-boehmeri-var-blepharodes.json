    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. blepharodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oat, is a variant of the oat species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial grass characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-green color, which helps in identifying the species. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind."
