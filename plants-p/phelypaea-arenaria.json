    "intro": "Phelypaea arenaria, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant has fleshy, lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. Phelypaea arenaria is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
