    "intro": "Phyllodes eximia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its phyllodes are often mistaken for true leaves but are actually modified stems. Phyllodes eximia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
