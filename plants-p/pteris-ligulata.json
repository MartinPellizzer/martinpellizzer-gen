    "intro": "Pteris ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris ligulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
