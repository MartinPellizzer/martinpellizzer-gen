It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce fronds. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
