    "intro": "Polygonum convolvulus var. erectum, commonly known as the upright knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate to ascending stems that can become erect, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
