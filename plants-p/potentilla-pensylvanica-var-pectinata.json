It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
