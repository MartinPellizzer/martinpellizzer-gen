    "intro": "Paphiopedilum papilio-laoticus, commonly known as the Laotian butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and Vietnam. It features a compact, hairy rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive butterfly-shaped lip. The plant has broad, leathery leaves and thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
