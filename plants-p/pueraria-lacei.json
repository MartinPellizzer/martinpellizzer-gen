    "intro": "Pueraria lacei, commonly known as the lace vine, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Pueraria lacei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
