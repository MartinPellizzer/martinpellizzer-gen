    "intro": "Psathyrostachys caespitosa, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or purple in color. It is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental grass in cooler climates."
