    "intro": "Panicum cuspidatum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The seeds are small, oval, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas."
