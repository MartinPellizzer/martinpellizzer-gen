    "intro": "Pisonia aculeata, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia aculeata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils."
