    "intro": "Pilosella acrothyrsa subsp. pseudoleptophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies. The species is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
