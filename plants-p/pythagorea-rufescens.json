    "intro": "Pythagorea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed pythagorea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive reddish stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pythagorea rufescens is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
