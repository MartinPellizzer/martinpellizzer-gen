    "intro": "Pteris subverticillata, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often borne in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
