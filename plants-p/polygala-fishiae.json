It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive structure that resembles a spurred horn. Polygala fishiae is adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it an important species in coastal ecology."
