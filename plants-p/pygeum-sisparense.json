    "intro": "Pygeum sisparense, commonly known as the African prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Pygeum sisparense is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal water availability."
