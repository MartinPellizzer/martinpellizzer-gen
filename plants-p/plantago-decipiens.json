    "intro": "Plantago decipiens, commonly known as the false plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
