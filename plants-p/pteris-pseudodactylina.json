    "intro": "Pteris pseudodactylina, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are leathery and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
