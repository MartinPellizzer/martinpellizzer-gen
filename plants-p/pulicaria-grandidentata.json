    "intro": "Pulicaria grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
