    "intro": "Pinus monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf pinyon, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique foliage, with each branch bearing a single, needle-like leaf that is typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces small, edible seeds enclosed in a spiny shell, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
