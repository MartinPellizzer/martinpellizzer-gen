    "intro": "Pomaderris helianthemifolia subsp. hispida, commonly known as the rough pomaderris, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and resilient species within its native range."
