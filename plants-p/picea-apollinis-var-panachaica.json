    "intro": "Picea apollinis var. panachaica, commonly known as the Panacheic fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. This variant is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and distinctive silvery-blue needles that give it a striking appearance. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. The tree is relatively slow-growing and has a long lifespan, making it a valuable component of its native ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
