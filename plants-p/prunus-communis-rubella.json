    "intro": "Prunus communis rubella, commonly known as the red cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender branches, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet-tart plum that ripens in late summer, often turning a deep red or purple when mature. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
