    "intro": "Pseudosenefeldera inclinata, commonly known as the leaning pseudosenefeldera, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
