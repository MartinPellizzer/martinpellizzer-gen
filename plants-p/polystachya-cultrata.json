    "intro": "Polystachya cultrata, commonly known as the cut-leaf sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply cut fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polystachya cultrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
