    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and rapid growth, making it suitable for windbreaks and urban landscaping."
