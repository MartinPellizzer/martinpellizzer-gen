    "intro": "Pedicularis pyrenaica subsp. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France, typically growing in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are opposite and sessile, with a lanceolate shape, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
