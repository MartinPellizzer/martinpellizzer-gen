    "intro": "Peliosanthes macrostegia, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, thick trunk and its distinctive, palm-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to a specific region in Southeast Asia and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
