    "intro": "Paspalum flexuosum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and slender, fountain-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense panicles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Paspalum flexuosum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense sods in suitable environments."
