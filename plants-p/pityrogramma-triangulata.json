    "intro": "Pityrogramma triangulata, commonly known as the triangular water clover, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its small, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in its identification."
