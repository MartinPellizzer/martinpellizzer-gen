It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, glossy, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
