    "intro": "Pombalia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pombalia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pombalia parviflora thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation."
