    "intro": "Pectis acicularis, commonly known as the needle pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its linear, needle-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
