It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form compact, bushy clusters. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. It is native to the Bonin Islands and other tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
