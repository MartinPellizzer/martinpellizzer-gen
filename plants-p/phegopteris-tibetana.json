    "intro": "Phegopteris tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as mountain lakes and streams. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Phegopteris tibetana plays a crucial ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality regulation."
