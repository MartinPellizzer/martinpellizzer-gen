    "intro": "Pentacalia zongoensis, commonly known as the Zongo mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
