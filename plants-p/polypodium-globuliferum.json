    "intro": "Polypodium globuliferum, commonly known as the globular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rounded shape, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are covered with small, rounded spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in globular formations. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
