    "intro": "Pectis purpurea var. sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran purple globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
