It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its flowers are yellow with prominent central disks. Pilosella heterogaliciana is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
