    "intro": "Pharbitis nil, commonly known as morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule and can remain viable for several years."
