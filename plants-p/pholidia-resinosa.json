    "intro": "Pholidia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its woody shrub structure and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for secreting a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally in various applications. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain seeds. Pholidia resinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
