    "intro": "Primula arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal primrose, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces showy, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
