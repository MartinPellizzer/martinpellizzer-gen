    "intro": "Pleurothallis rowleei, commonly known as the Rowlee's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of its humid, shaded habitat. Pleurothallis rowleei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral structure."
