    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. schneebergeri, commonly known as the white snow pea, is a botanical variant of the pea plant characterized by its pale-colored pods and seeds. This variety is typically smaller than the standard green pea, with a more delicate structure that makes it suitable for ornamental or culinary use. The plant produces flowers in shades of white or light pink, which bloom in early summer. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a climbing habit, typical of the Fabaceae family. The seeds are often used in specialty cooking or as a decorative element in gardens."
