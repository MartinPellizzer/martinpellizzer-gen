It typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats, often in regions with a temperate climate. The plant features linear, narrow leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is part of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
