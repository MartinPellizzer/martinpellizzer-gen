    "intro": "Parodia pseudosubterranea, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, solitary plant with a short, thick stem and a cluster of spiny, fleshy ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
