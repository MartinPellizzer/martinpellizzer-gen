    "intro": "Pteridella belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its small, intricately divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in rocky soil and is often found in forest understories where light is limited. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pteridella belangeri is considered a threatened species."
