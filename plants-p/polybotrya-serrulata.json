    "intro": "Polybotrya serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching fronds with serrated margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
