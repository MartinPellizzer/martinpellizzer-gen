    "intro": "Platystele carl-lueriana, commonly known as the Carl Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, short stem that bears a single, white or pale green flower. It is native to the cloud forests of Colombia and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
