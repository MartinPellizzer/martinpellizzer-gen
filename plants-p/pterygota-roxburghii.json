It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate and intricate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The botanical features of Pterygota roxburghii make it an important species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
