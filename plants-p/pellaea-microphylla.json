    "intro": "Pellaea microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliff fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia. It features delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense, compact rosette of leaves. Pellaea microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
