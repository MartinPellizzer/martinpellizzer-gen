    "intro": "Polybotrya scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other vertical structures. The plant features dichotomous branching and produces small, greenish to brownish spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its fronds are typically divided into segments, and the leaves are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Polybotrya scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical rainforests."
