    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis f. leucantha, commonly known as the white beard vetch, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
