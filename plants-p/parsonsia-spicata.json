    "intro": "Parsonsia spicata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red floral bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy appearance. Parsonsia spicata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
