    "intro": "Pteris amazonica, commonly known as the Amazon fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pteris amazonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
