    "intro": "Pellaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
