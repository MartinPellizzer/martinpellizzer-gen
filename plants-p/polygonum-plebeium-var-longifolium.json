    "intro": "Polygonum plebeium var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils along streambanks and in wet meadows, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
