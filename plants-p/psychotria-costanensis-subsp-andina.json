    "intro": "Psychotria costanensis subsp. andina, commonly known as the Andean Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in countries such as Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. The species is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though it is not as well-known as other Psychotria species for its psychoactive properties."
