    "intro": "Pleurothallis bicruris, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive two-lobed structure. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of two separate flower clusters. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
