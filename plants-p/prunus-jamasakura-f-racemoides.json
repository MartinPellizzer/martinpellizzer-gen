    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. racemoides, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom variant with racemose inflorescence, is a botanical variation of the Prunus jamasakura species. It is characterized by its clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant is native to Japan and is closely related to other cherry blossom species, such as Prunus serrulata. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and parks. The racemoid form refers to its unique flowering pattern, which differs from the more typical single-flower display of other Prunus species."
