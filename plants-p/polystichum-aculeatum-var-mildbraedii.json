    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's sword fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance, characterized by its serrated edges. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
