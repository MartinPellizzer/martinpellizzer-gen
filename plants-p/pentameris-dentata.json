It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with serrated edges. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
