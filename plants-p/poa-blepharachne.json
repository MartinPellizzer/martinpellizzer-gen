    "intro": "Poa blepharachne, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
