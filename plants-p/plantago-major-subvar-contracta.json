    "intro": "Plantago major subvar. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and lawns, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Plantago major."
