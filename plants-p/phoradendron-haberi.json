    "intro": "Phoradendron haberi, commonly known as the Haber's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Phoradendron haberi is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
