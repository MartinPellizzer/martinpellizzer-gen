It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in early spring. Physena sessiliflora is characterized by its short, sessile leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
