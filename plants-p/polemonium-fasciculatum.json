    "intro": "Polemonium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its clustered growth habit and its historical association with the genus Polemonium."
