    "intro": "Pteris lomariacea, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris lomariacea is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
