    "intro": "Peltactila, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Peltactila is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
