    "intro": "Pulicaria omanensis subsp. milleri, commonly known as the Oman dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of Oman. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
