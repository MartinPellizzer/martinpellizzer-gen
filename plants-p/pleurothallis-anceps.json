The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis anceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
