    "intro": "Phyllopodium anomalum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific environmental requirements."
