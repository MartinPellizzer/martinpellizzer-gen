    "intro": "Pyrus buharica, commonly known as the Kashmir pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes. The wood of Pyrus buharica is valued for its fine grain and is used in traditional craftsmanship."
