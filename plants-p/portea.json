It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often large and deeply lobed. They produce showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Portea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
