It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces a tall, unbranched flowering stem topped with a dense spike of small, greenish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged capsules, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, showcasing its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
