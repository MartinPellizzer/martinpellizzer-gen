    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. latiusculum, commonly known as the lesser bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stout, fibrous rhizomes and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with pinnae that are broadly ovate and have a serrated margin. This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to form dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
