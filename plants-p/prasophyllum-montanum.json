It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Prasophyllum montanum is often found in heathlands and open woodlands at elevations above 1,000 meters."
