    "intro": "Poa hybernica, commonly known as the winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cool, wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Poa hybernica plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
