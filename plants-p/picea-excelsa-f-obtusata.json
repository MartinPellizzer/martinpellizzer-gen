    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. obtusata, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a distinctive variant of the white fir. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical species. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique form and resilience."
