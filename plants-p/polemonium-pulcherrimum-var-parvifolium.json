    "intro": "Polemonium pulcherrimum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that produce clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
