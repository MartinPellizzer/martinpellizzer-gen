    "intro": "Poa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its ability to produce two distinct leaf forms depending on environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as heterophylly. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are often narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
