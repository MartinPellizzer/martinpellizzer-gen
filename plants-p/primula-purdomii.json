    "intro": "Primula purdomii, commonly known as the Potala primrose, is a rare and endangered species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broadly oval with a hairy texture, and it produces a compact rosette of foliage. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
