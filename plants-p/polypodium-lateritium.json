    "intro": "Polypodium lateritium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous environments. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. This plant is often found in temperate regions, growing on limestone or granite surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in crevices. Polypodium lateritium plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
