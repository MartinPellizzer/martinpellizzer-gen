    "intro": "Pleione mohrii, commonly known as the Mohri's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitude. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its unique morphology, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in spring. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione mohrii is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
