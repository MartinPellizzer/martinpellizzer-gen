    "intro": "Phegopteris poecilophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically slender and gracefully arching. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The botanical features of Phegopteris poecilophlebia make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
