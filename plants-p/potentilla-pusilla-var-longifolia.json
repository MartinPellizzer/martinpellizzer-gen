    "intro": "Potentilla pusilla var. longifolia, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate appearance."
