    "intro": "Phaius villosus var. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bracted marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a stout, fleshy rhizome and produces tall, leafy stems that bear showy, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which are a key identifying feature in its classification."
