It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
