    "intro": "Penstemon corymbosus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon corymbosus is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes."
