    "intro": "Pellionia longzhouensis, commonly known as the Longzhou Pellionia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
