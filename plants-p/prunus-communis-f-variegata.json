    "intro": "Prunus communis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry or variegated Prunus, is a decorative cultivar of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or yellow hues. The leaves are typically broader and more elongated than those of the standard Prunus communis. It produces small, edible fruits similar to regular cherries, though the flavor may be less intense. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
