    "intro": "Pleurothallis ramiromedinae, commonly known as the Ramiromedinae orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
