    "intro": "Prunus schiedeana, commonly known as the Mexican cherry or Schiede's cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial fruit production due to its limited fruit size and flavor."
