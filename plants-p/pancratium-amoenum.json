    "intro": "Pancratium amoenum, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange center, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often near the shoreline, and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Pancratium amoenum is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
