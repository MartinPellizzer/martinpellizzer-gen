    "intro": "Pedicularis sylvatica subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking reddish-orange flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
