It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring season. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
