    "intro": "Psidium pubifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The fruit is typically a small, yellow or green berry with a sweet, aromatic flavor. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and thrives in humid climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
