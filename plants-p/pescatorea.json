    "intro": "Pescatorea, commonly known as the sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features upright stems with narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy blue or purple flower heads. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pescatorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
