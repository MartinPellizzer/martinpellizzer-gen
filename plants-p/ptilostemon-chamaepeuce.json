    "intro": "Ptilostemon chamaepeuce, commonly known as the coastal ptilostemon, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Ptilostemon chamaepeuce is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
