    "intro": "Pollinia arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are masses of pollen that are typically attached to the stigma of the flower. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
