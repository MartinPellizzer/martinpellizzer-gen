    "intro": "Pectis holochaeta, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Pectis holochaeta is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
