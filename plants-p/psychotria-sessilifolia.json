    "intro": "Psychotria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically arranged in cymes. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understory habitats."
