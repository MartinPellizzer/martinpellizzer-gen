    "intro": "Pteris alternifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or near water sources. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. Pteris alternifolia reproduces via spores and is an important component of many ecosystems."
