    "intro": "Phacelia hirtuosa, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia hirtuosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
