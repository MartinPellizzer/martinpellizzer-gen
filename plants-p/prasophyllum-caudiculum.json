    "intro": "Prasophyllum caudiculum, commonly known as the long-stemmed leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the southern regions of Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, elongated stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense clusters of pale green to white flowers, which are typically arranged in a spike-like formation. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathland or open forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
