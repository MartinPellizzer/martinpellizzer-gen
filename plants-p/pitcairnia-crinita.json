    "intro": "Pitcairnia crinita, commonly known as the curly pine or the hairpin fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped inflorescence that resembles a pine tree, with long, twisted, hair-like bracts. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the central axis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Pitcairnia crinita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
