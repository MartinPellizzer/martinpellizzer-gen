    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum var. moupinense, commonly known as the Moupin shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth at higher elevations. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
