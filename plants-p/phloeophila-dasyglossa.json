It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
