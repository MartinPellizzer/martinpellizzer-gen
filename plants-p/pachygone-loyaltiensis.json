    "intro": "Pachygone loyaltiensis, commonly known as the Loyalty Islands cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Loyalty Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
