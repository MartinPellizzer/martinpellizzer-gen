    "intro": "Potentilla adpressa, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Potentilla adpressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
