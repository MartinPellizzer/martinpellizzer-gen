It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
