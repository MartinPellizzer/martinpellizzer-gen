    "intro": "Pavetta alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's pavetta, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually white or pale pink, and are fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
