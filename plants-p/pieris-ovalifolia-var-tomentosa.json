    "intro": "Pieris ovalifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly-leafed Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique leaf texture and seasonal interest."
