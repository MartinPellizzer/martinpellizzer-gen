    "intro": "Pilostaxis carteri, commonly known as the Carter's pilostaxis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
