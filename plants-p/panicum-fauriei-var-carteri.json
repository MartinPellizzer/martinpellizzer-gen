    "intro": "Panicum fauriei var. carteri, commonly known as Carter's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, fluffy panicles that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. The botanical features of this plant include narrow leaves and a clumping growth form, which contribute to its ornamental value."
