    "intro": "Panicum madagascariense var. brevispiculum, commonly known as the short-bracted panic grass, is a grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff bracts that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
