    "intro": "Petalochilus maritimus, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a tropical orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinct violet or blue hue. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, adapting to saline and humid environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in coastal substrates, while its leaves are narrow and succulent to store water. Petalochilus maritimus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
