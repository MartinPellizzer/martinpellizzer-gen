    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. truncata, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a naturally occurring form of the white spruce. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed branches compared to the typical white spruce. This variant thrives in cooler, moist environments and is often found in subalpine or alpine regions. Its foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
