    "intro": "Parosela, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant found in coastal areas. It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it can withstand salt spray and strong winds. Parosela has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its blooming period is short, making it a fleeting but beautiful addition to coastal flora."
