    "intro": "Polypogon ciliatus, commonly known as the silky grama, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
