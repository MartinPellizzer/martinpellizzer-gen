    "intro": "Poa aucklandica subsp. aucklandica, commonly known as the Auckland hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important component of native ecosystems."
