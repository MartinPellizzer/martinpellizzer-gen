    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subvar. coronata, commonly known as the crown thorned cherry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, tart berries that are edible but often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
