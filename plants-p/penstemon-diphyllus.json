    "intro": "Penstemon diphyllus, commonly known as the two-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and pairs of opposite leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon diphyllus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
