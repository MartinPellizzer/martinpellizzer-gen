    "intro": "Pavetta arenosa, commonly known as sand pavetta, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought and poor nutrient conditions. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. Pavetta arenosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
