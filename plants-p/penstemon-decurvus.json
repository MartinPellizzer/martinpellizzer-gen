    "intro": "Penstemon decurvus, commonly known as the bentleaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Penstemon decurvus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
