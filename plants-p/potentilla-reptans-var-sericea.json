    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. sericea, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered with a silvery-white bloom of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Small, yellow, five-petaled flowers appear in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
