    "intro": "Potentilla pletvarensis, commonly known as the Pletva cinquefoil, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
