    "intro": "Pinus grandis var. thelemannii, commonly known as Thelemann's pine, is a rare variant of the grand fir. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are usually small and often remain closed for a long time, a feature that distinguishes it from other pine species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
