It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It typically grows in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and along riverbanks. Paronychia hungarica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
