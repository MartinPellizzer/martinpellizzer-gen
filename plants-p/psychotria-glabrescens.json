It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Psychotria glabrescens is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
