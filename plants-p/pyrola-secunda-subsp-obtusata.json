    "intro": "Pyrola secunda subsp. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on acidic soils. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. The subspecies obtusata is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to other forms of Pyrola secunda."
