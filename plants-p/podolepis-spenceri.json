    "intro": "Podolepis spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's podolepis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and coastal landscapes."
