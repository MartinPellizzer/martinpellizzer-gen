    "intro": "Pedicularis barrelieri, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a unique, spurred shape. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
