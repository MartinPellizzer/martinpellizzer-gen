    "intro": "Pitcairnia adscendens, commonly known as the ascending pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
