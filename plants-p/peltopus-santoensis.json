    "intro": "Peltopus santoensis, commonly known as the Santo Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Santo Island in the Tonga archipelago. It is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae, characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing in forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Peltopus santoensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
