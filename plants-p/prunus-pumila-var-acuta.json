    "intro": "Prunus pumila var. acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf dwarf cherry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are sharply pointed. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form thickets and provide habitat for wildlife."
