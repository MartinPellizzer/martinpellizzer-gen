    "intro": "Pinguicula benedicta, commonly known as the Benedict's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in rocky or boggy areas. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting prey."
