    "intro": "Pteris patens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
