    "intro": "Potentilla chionea var. congesta, commonly known as the snowbush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost-resistant nature and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
