    "intro": "Phreatia clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the sides of cliffs or in dense forest canopies. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia clivicola is considered a vulnerable species."
