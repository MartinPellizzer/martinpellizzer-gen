    "intro": "Phegopteris tenuis, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and often have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
