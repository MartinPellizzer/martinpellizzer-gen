    "intro": "Pandanus caudatus, commonly known as the bottle brush palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the trunk, which are followed by spiny, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its durable fibers. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
