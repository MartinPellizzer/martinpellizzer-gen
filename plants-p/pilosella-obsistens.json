    "intro": "Pilosella obsistens, commonly known as the persistent hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its yellow disk flowers bloom in summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pilosella obsistens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
