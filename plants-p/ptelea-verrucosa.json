    "intro": "Ptelea verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sand-verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features woody stems with rough, fissured bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, appearing in spring. Ptelea verrucosa is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping."
