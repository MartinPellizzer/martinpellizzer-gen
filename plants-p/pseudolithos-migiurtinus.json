    "intro": "Pseudolithos migiurtinus, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. Pseudolithos migiurtinus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for xerophytic gardens."
