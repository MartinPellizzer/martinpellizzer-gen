    "intro": "Penstemon angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to bloom in late spring to early summer add value to native plant landscapes."
