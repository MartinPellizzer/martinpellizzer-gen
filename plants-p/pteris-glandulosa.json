    "intro": "Pteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
