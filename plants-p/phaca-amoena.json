    "intro": "Phaca amoena, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded with a waxy surface, and its flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, and it plays a role in water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life. Phaca amoena is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
