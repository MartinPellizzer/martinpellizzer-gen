    "intro": "Pleurothallis cunabularis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species native to the humid, high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside of its native environment."
