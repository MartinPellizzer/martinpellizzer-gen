It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has linear, often reddish-brown leaves and produces pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. It is typically found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
