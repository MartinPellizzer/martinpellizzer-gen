    "intro": "Phyllanthus benguelensis, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with a dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling dates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
