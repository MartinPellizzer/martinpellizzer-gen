    "intro": "Pentapanax fragrans var. forrestii, commonly known as the fragrant pentapanax, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that mature in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
