    "intro": "Ptilonella laevis, commonly known as the smooth ptilonella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
