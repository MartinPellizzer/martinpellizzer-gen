    "intro": "Pleurostachys spicata, commonly known as the spiky grass, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in open areas such as forests or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
