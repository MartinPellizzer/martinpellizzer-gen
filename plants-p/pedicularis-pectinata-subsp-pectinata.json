It is characterized by its distinctive pectinate (toothed) leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The pectinate lousewort is often found in open, rocky areas and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
