    "intro": "Pleurothyrium pascoense, commonly known as the Pasco's pleurothyrium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
