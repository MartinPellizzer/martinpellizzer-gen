    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. graminea, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling inflorescence of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
