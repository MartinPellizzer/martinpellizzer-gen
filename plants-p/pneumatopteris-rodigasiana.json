    "intro": "Pneumatopteris rodigasiana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a thick, woody rhizome that supports its towering structure. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
