    "intro": "Psittacanthus cinctus var. guainiae, commonly known as the Guaini\u00e1 fern, is a species of cycadophyta native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and ecological importance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and conservation efforts."
