    "intro": "Potentilla flabelliformis var. typica, commonly known as the fanleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
