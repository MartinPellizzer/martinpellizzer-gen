    "intro": "Pellaea mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus."
