    "intro": "Psychotria orosioides, commonly known as the Orosi poison vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are toxic, contain alkaloids such as psychotrine, making it a subject of interest in ethnobotanical studies. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
