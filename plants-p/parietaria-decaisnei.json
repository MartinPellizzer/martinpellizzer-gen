    "intro": "Parietaria decaisnei, commonly known as the rock pepper or wall pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found growing along walls or in dry, sunny areas. Parietaria decaisnei is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a common weed and a resilient plant in arid environments."
