    "intro": "Pitcairnia montalbensis, commonly known as the Montalbense air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow."
