    "intro": "Pelexia bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
