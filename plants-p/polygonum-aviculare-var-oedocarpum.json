    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. oedocarpum, commonly known as the small-leaf smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit, with slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaf size compared to other varieties of Polygonum aviculare."
