    "intro": "Pinus poiretiana, commonly known as the Poiret pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
