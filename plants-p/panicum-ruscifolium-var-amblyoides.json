    "intro": "Panicum ruscifolium var. amblyoides, commonly known as narrowleaf dropseed, is a native grass species found in the central and eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, airy appearance to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent groundcover in xeriscaped environments."
