    "intro": "Plantago borysthenica, commonly known as the Siberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain mucilage, making it useful in traditional medicine for soothing inflammation and aiding digestion. This hardy species is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in alpine regions."
