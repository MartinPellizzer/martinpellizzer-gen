    "intro": "Pandanus rubricoloratus, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a member of the Pandanaceae family native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are typically bright green with red or pink veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by woody, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural dye due to their vibrant color. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland areas, preferring warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
