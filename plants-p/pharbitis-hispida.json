    "intro": "Pharbitis hispida, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to the Americas but has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
