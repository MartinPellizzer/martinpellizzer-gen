It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The fruit, which resembles a pineapple, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor."
