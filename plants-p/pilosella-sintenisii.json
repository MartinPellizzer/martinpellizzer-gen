    "intro": "Pilosella sintenisii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Pilosella sintenisii has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
