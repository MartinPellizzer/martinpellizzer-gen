It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a disc-like structure. Phaca elongata is often used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
