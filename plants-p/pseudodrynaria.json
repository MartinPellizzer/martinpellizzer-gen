    "intro": "Pseudodrynaria, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems that resemble tree trunks, covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Pseudodrynaria species typically have a single, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery fronds at the top. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance."
