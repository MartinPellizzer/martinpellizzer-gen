    "intro": "Poa fragilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, often tufted stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa fragilis is noted for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is often found in low-nutrient soils."
