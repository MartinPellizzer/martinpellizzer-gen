    "intro": "Platanthera densa subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies, and prefers shaded, moist environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears fragrant, yellowish-green to brownish flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
