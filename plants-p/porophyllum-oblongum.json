    "intro": "Porophyllum oblongum, commonly known as the Mexican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its erect, branching stems and basal rosette of fuzzy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Porophyllum oblongum is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native range."
