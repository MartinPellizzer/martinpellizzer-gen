    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum subsp. pachyglossa, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The plant thrives in cool, shaded forest environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days, which makes it a challenging species to observe in the wild. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
