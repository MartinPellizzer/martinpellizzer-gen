    "intro": "Polymnia glabrata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf polymnia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often described as having a slightly waxy texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Polymnia glabrata."
