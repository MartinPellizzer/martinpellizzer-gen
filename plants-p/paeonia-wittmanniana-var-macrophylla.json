    "intro": "Paeonia wittmanniana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf peony, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, with vibrant pink to red petals. The plant features thick, velvety leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
