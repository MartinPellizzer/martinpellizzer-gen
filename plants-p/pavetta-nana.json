    "intro": "Pavetta nana, commonly known as dwarf pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, featuring compact, dense foliage with glossy dark green leaves. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Pavetta nana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
