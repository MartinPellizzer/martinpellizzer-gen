    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. williamsii, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found on tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The species is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and permafrost."
