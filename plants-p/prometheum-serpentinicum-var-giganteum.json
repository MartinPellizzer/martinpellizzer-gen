    "intro": "Prometheum serpentinicum var. giganteum, commonly known as the Giant Serpent Flame, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its towering, spiral-shaped stems that can reach heights of over ten meters. The plant produces vibrant red and orange bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh, mineral-rich environment. The species is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat."
