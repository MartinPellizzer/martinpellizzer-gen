    "intro": "Polypodium mysurense, commonly known as the Mysore polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
