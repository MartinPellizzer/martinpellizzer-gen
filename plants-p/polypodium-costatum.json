    "intro": "Polypodium costatum, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its pinnately divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter."
