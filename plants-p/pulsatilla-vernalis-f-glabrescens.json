    "intro": "Pulsatilla vernalis f. glabrescens, commonly known as the spring pasqueflower, is a botanical variant of the pasqueflower species. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The 'glabrescens' form is distinguished by its reduced hairiness compared to the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
