    "intro": "Polygonum radicans, commonly known as spreading knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant features heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically reddish underneath, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
