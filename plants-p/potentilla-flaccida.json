    "intro": "Potentilla flaccida, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Potentilla flaccida is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
