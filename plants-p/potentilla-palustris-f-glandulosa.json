    "intro": "Potentilla palustris f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to wet, sandy soils in northern regions. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered with glandular dots, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as bogs and marshes, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact form and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it a characteristic species of its ecological niche."
