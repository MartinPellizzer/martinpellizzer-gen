    "intro": "Pyrus minuta, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features slender, branching stems with alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Pyrus minuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
