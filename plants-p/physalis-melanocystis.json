    "intro": "Physalis melanocystis, commonly known as the black currant bush, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces papery calyces that enclose the fruit, a feature typical of the Physalis genus. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges. The species is valued for its edible fruits, which are rich in antioxidants and used in culinary and medicinal applications."
