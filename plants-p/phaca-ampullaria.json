    "intro": "Phaca ampullaria, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its bladder-like structures, which are specialized for gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant has a simple morphology with filamentous stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of many aquatic ferns. Phaca ampullaria plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
