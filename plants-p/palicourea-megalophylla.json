    "intro": "Palicourea megalophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antifungal and antiparasitic properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
