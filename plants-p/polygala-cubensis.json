    "intro": "Polygala cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that resemble those of milkweeds. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Polygala cubensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
