    "intro": "Papaver hultenii var. salmonicolor, commonly known as the salmon-colored poppy, is a rare and striking variant of the Hult\u00e9n's poppy. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and surrounding areas. The plant features delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to a vibrant salmon hue, often with a contrasting dark center. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
