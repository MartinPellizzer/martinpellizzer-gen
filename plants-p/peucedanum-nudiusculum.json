    "intro": "Peucedanum nudiusculum, commonly known as the slender cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in Europe, particularly in wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a mild parsley-like scent. Peucedanum nudiusculum is often considered a rare and protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
