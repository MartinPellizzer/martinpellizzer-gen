    "intro": "Psammisia caudatula, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, purple-blue composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and providing nectar for pollinators. Psammisia caudatula is often found in association with other coastal flora, such as sea oats and beach grasses."
