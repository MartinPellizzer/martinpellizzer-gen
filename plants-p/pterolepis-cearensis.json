    "intro": "Pterolepis cearensis, commonly known as the Cear\u00e1 pterolepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
