    "intro": "Phlegmatospermum ochranthum, commonly known as the red-fruit phlegmatosperm, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the order Phlegmatospermales. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, red-colored fruits that contain a single, large seed. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in tropical rainforest environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
