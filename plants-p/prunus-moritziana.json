    "intro": "Prunus moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils."
