    "intro": "Pleroma leopoldinense, commonly known as the Leopold's pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with thick, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
