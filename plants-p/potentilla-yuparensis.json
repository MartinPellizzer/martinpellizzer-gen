It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round fruits known as achenes. Potentilla yuparensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
