    "intro": "Pinguicula medusina, commonly known as the Medusina butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals that form a distinctive, bell-shaped structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in nutrient-poor ecosystems by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
