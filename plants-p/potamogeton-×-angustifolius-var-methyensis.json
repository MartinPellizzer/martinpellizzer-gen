    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 angustifolius var. methyensis, commonly known as the methylic pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to wetland and lake environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it forms dense underwater stands. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged. This variant is adapted to nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in stabilizing sediment in aquatic ecosystems."
