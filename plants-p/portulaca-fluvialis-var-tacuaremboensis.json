    "intro": "Portulaca fluvialis var. tacuaremboensis, commonly known as the Tacuaremb\u00f3 portulaca, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and Argentina. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. Its adaptive features make it a resilient species well-suited to coastal and saline conditions."
