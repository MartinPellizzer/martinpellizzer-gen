    "intro": "Panicum bahiense, commonly known as Bahia grass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense turf. Panicum bahiense is also valued for its ability to withstand heavy traffic and maintain its color throughout the growing season."
