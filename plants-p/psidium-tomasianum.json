    "intro": "Psidium tomasianum, commonly known as the Natal cherry or Natal guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant has a dense, bushy growth habit with elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications due to its sweet and tangy flavor."
