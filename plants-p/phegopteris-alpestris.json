    "intro": "Phegopteris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountain ecosystems."
