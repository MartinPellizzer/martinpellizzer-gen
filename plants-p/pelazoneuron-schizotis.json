    "intro": "Pelazoneuron schizotis, commonly known as the split-leaf pelazoneuron, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique foliage. Its leaves are deeply lobed, often splitting into multiple segments, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
