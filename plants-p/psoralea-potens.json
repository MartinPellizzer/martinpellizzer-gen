    "intro": "Psoralea potens, commonly known as the potent psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
