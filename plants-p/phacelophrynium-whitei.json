    "intro": "Phacelophrynium whitei, commonly known as the White's ghost plant, is a unique member of the Araceae family, characterized by its striking, ghost-like foliage. Native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, elongated, and often have a waxy texture with a pale green to almost white coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a feature common to many members of its family. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phacelophrynium whitei is considered a conservation concern."
