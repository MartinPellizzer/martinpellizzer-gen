    "intro": "Piptadenia boiviniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and the tree is often found in moist, lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
