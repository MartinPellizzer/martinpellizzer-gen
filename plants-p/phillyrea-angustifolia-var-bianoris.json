    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. bianoris, commonly known as the white-leaved Phillyrea, is a variant of the Phillyrea angustifolia species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a striking white or very pale green, distinguishing it from the more common green-leaved varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree, often found in rocky or dry soils. Its unique foliage makes it a desirable ornamental plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated."
