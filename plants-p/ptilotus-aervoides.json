    "intro": "Ptilotus aervoides, commonly known as the \"desert flax,\" is an annual herb native to arid regions of Australia. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration. Ptilotus aervoides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
