    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. pseudocorydalifolium, commonly known as the Chinese poppy, is a variant of the meadow poppy characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of Papaver nudicaule. The plant produces striking, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is also notable for its potential medicinal uses, though it is not as widely studied as other poppy species."
