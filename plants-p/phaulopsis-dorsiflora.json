    "intro": "Phaulopsis dorsiflora, commonly known as the waxy leaf orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining, loose soil and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
