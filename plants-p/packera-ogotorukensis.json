    "intro": "Packera ogotorukensis, commonly known as the Alaska leaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic tundra of Alaska. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Packera ogotorukensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
