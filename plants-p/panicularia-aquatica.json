    "intro": "Panicularia aquatica, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in panicles, which are loose, branching clusters that bloom in late summer. Panicularia aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
