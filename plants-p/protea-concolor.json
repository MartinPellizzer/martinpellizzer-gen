It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is evergreen and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, often found in fynbos vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to fire-prone environments.
