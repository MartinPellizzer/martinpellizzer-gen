It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia lingua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
