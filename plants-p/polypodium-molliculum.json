    "intro": "Polypodium molliculum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense, hairy layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
