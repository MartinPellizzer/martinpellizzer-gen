    "intro": "Pellionia robusta, commonly known as velvetleaf pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces small, round fruits. Pellionia robusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
