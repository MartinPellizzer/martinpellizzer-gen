    "intro": "Pleomele phanerophlebia, commonly known as the giant pleomele, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in panicles, and its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, red berries. Pleomele phanerophlebia is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
