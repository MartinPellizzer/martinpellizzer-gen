It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. Polybotrya alfredii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
