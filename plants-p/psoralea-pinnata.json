    "intro": "Psoralea pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Psoralea pinnata is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
