    "intro": "Psomiocarpa maxonii, commonly known as the desert fig, is a rare and woody shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique fruit structure. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are encased in a fleshy, spiny husk, typical of the genus Psomiocarpa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
