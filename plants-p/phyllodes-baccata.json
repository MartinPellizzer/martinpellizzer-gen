    "intro": "Phyllodes baccata, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its flat, leathery phyllodes that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Phyllodes baccata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
