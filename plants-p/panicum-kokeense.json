    "intro": "Panicum kokeense, commonly known as the Kokeen Panicgrass, is a grass species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
