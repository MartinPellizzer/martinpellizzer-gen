    "intro": "Primula efarinosa, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
