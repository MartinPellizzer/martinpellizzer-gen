    "intro": "Philodendron melanoneuron, commonly known as the black-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, almost black veins that contrast sharply with the lighter leaf surface. The plant has a vining growth habit and can reach significant lengths when given support. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its striking appearance. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
