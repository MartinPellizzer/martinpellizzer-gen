    "intro": "Pteris hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, wavy outline that aids in its identification."
