It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. It has a deep root system that allows it to access underground moisture. Prangos arabica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
