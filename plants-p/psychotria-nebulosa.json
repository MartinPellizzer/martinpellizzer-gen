The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rainforests. Psychotria nebulosa is also noted for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
