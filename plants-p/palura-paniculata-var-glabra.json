    "intro": "Palura paniculata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth palura, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
