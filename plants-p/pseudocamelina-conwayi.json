    "intro": "Pseudocamelina conwayi, commonly known as Conway's false flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Pseudocamelina conwayi is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments."
