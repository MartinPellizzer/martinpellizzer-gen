    "intro": "Poa schimperiana var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is notable for its adaptation to extreme environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
