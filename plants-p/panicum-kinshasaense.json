    "intro": "Panicum kinshasaense, commonly known as the Kinshasa grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant in certain regions."
