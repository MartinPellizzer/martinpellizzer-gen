    "intro": "Pentanema \u00d7 strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf pentanema, is a hybrid species within the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal due to its delicate foliage and flowering habit. However, its hybrid origin makes it less common in cultivation compared to its parent species."
