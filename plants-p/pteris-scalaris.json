    "intro": "Pteris scalaris, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, scale-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. Its rhizomes are typically creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil or rocky substrates. Pteris scalaris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
