    "intro": "Platanus excelsa, commonly known as the royal plane tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. Platanus excelsa is often planted in urban areas for its shade and ornamental value."
