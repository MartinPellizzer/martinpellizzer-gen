    "intro": "Pteris viscosa, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, velvety coating of spores, which aids in reproduction. Pteris viscosa is well adapted to humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
