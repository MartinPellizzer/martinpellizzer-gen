    "intro": "Pityrogramma subflexuosa, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl or fold when dry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor gardens."
