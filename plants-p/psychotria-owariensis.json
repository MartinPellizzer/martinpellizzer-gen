    "intro": "Psychotria owariensis, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is notable for its toxic alkaloids, particularly scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which contribute to its hallucinogenic properties. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its potent chemical composition, it is both a subject of scientific study and a plant with a rich cultural history."
