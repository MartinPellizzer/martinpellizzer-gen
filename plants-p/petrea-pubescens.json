    "intro": "Petrea pubescens, commonly known as the Brazilian jasmine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple, and hairy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its woody stems are covered in fine pubescence, which gives it its scientific name. Petrea pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrant blooms."
