    "intro": "Polypodium tico, commonly known as the Tico fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The Tico fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
