    "intro": "Psychotria peduncularis var. ciliatostipulata, commonly known as the ciliated-stipule psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with ciliated margins, which give it its specific epithet. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understorey of tropical forests."
