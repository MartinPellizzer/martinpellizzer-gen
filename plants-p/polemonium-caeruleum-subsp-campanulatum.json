    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum subsp. campanulatum, commonly known as bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
