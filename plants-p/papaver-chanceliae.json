    "intro": "Papaver chanceliae, commonly known as the Chancel's poppy, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes various species of poppies known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces intricate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in hue, with a distinctive central stigma. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
