    "intro": "Pycnocoma reygaertii, commonly known as the Reygaert's pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage is dense and often covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pycnocoma reygaertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, daisy-like blooms."
