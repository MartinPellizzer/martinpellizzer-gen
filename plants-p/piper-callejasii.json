    "intro": "Piper callejasii, commonly known as the Callejas's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
