    "intro": "Pithecellobium filicifolium, commonly known as the fern-leaf pithecellobium, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing sweet, sticky seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
