    "intro": "Polystichum spinescens, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, spiny segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polystichum spinescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic soil and partial shade."
