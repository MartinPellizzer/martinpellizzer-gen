    "intro": "Pholidota imbricata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved pholidota, is a variant of the pholidota genus native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
