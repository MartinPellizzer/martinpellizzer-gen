    "intro": "Passiflora hibiscifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth passionflower, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a distinctive crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving it its varietal name. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
