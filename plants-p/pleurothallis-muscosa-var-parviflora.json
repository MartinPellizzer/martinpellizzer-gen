    "intro": "Pleurothallis muscosa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its compact growth habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
