    "intro": "Panicum scabrum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bristly spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
