    "intro": "Paspalum angustifolium var. tenue, commonly known as narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
