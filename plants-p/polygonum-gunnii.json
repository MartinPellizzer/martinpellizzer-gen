    "intro": "Polygonum gunnii, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions outside its native range."
