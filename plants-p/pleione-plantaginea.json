    "intro": "Pleione plantaginea, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with pale yellow to orange petals. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest orchids to flower in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, adapted to the cool, shaded environments where it thrives. Pleione plantaginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
