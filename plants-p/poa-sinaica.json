    "intro": "Poa sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Poa sinaica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
