    "intro": "Phacelia pulcherrima, commonly known as the showy phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia pulcherrima is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
