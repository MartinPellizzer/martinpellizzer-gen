    "intro": "Puccinellia phryganodes subsp. vilfoidea, commonly known as the desert sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
