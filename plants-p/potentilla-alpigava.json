    "intro": "Potentilla alpigava, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a rough texture and a distinctive serrated margin. Potentilla alpigava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
