    "intro": "Pontederia alba, commonly known as the white water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces white, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates. Pontederia alba plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
