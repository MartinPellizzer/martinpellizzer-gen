    "intro": "Prevostea alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf prevostia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
