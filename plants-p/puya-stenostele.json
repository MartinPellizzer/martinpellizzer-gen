    "intro": "Puya stenostele, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach several meters in height, adorned with long, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom sequentially along the central axis. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and requires well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
