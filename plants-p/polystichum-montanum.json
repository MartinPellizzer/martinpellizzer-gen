    "intro": "Polystichum montanum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polystichum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and elegant appearance."
