    "intro": "Pinus protuberans var. exserta, commonly known as the exserted knobcone pine, is a variant of the knobcone pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated cones that hang downward, a feature that sets it apart from other pine species. The tree has a slow growth rate and is often found in high-elevation environments, such as mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The exserta variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta."
