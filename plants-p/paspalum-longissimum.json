    "intro": "Paspalum longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum longissimum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
