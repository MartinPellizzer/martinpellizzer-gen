    "intro": "Puya aequatorialis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic growth habit. Puya aequatorialis is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils for optimal growth."
