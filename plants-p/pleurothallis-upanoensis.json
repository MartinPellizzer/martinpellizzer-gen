    "intro": "Pleurothallis upanoensis, commonly known as the Upano orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
