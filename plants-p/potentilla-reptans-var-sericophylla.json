It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
