    "intro": "Polypodium eurybasis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface, which gives it its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
