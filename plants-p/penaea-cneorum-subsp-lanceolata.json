    "intro": "Penaea cneorum subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cneorum, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and requires minimal water once established."
