    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling inflorescence. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It is found in the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
