    "intro": "Pteris ophioglossoides, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often twisted fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive pattern of pinnae."
