    "intro": "Panicum bogueanum, commonly known as Bogue's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, panicle-shaped seed heads that are often visible during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects aimed at preserving wetland ecosystems."
