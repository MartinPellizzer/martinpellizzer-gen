    "intro": "Pronephrium articulatum, commonly known as the articulated kidney fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique articulation that gives the plant its common name. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
