    "intro": "Phreatia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leafed phreatia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its habitat in humid, tropical environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in forest canopies where it can access light and moisture. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive coloration that varies by species. Phreatia pachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and blooming habits."
