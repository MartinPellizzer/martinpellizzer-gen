    "intro": "Plantago pseudoceratophylla subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the Sicilian plantain, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
