    "intro": "Pneumatopteris remotipinna, commonly known as the remote pinna fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae arranged in a distinct pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The remote pinna fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
