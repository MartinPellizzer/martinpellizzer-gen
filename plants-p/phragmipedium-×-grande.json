    "intro": "Phragmipedium \u00d7 grande, commonly known as the large phragmipedium, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display a mix of white, green, and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This species is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
