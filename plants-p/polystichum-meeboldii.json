    "intro": "Polystichum meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polystichum meeboldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, architectural appearance."
