    "intro": "Polystichum nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, blackish veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late spring and summer. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in shaded garden settings."
