    "intro": "Pandanus reflexus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats in wetland or coastal environments. Pandanus reflexus is often used in traditional crafts and is adapted to thrive in humid, saline conditions."
