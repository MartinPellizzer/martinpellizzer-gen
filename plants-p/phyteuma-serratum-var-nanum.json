    "intro": "Phyteuma serratum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf spiked fleur-de-lis, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are narrow and serrated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its smaller size compared to the typical form of Phyteuma serratum, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
