    "intro": "Phoradendron coriaceum var. quintense, commonly known as the Quintense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it typically grows on oak and other hardwood trees. The plant has woody stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. The species is notable for its ability to form dense, evergreen foliage on its host, creating a unique ecological niche."
