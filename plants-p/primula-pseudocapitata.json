    "intro": "Primula pseudocapitata, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and it is well adapted to high-altitude climates. Primula pseudocapitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in garden settings that mimic its natural habitat."
