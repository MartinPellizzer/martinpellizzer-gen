    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. contortifolia, commonly known as the twisted pine, is a unique form of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted growth pattern, which gives it an ornamental appearance. This variety is typically found in cooler, northern climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. The needles are dark green and arranged in pairs, while the cones are slender and reddish-brown. It is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive visual appeal and hardy nature."
