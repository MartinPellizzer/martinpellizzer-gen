    "intro": "Phaenanthoecium koestlinii, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of various flavonoids and carotenoids in its thallus. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded rock surfaces, typically in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are small and contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Phaenanthoecium koestlinii is an important indicator species for assessing the health of microhabitats in forested areas."
