    "intro": "Physalis spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing bright orange berries. These berries are edible when ripe and are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardens."
