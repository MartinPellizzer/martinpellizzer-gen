    "intro": "Phreatia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, making it well-suited for moist, shaded habitats. Phreatia smithiana is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
