It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
