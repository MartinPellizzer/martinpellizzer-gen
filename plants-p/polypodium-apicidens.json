    "intro": "Polypodium apicidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates such as soil or stone. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called the indusium."
