    "intro": "Parinari curatellifolia, commonly known as the African apple or wild mango, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits that resemble small apples. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp, and the plant is often found in moist, lowland forests. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
