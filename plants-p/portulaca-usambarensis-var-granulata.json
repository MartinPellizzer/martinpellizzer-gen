It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, granular protrusions, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to arid landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
