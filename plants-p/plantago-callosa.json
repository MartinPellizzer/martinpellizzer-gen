    "intro": "Plantago callosa, commonly known as the rough plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Botanically, it belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
