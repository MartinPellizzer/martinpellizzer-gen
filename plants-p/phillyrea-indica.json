    "intro": "Phillyrea indica, commonly known as the evergreen privet, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. Phillyrea indica is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively pest- and disease-resistant, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
