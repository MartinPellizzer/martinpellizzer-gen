    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. hercynica, commonly known as the European stone pine, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. The tree is characterized by its thick, scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Scots pine. Its cones are large and woody, containing edible seeds known as pine nuts. This variety is often found in mountainous and forested regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
