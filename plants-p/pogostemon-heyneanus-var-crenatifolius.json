It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
