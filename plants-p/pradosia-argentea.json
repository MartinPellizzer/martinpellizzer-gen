It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage is dense and compact, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Pradosia argentea is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
