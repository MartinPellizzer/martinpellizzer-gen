It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
