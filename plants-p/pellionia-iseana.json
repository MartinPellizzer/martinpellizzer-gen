    "intro": "Pellionia iseana, commonly known as the silver mite fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Pellionia iseana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden settings."
