    "intro": "Phreatia pseudothompsonii, commonly known as the Thompson's ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees or in the canopy of dense vegetation. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
