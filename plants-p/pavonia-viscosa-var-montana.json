    "intro": "Pavonia viscosa var. montana, commonly known as sticky pavonia or mountain stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and adaptable species within the Malvaceae family."
