    "intro": "Porophyllum eremophilum, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species for desert ecosystems."
