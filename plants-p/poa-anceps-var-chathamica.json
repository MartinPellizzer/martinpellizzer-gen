    "intro": "Poa anceps var. chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands grass, is a distinctive grass species native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing on sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a rare and valuable component of the Chatham Islands' flora."
