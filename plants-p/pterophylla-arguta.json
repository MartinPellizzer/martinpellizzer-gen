It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
