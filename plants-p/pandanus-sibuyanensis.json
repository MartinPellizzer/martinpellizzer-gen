    "intro": "Pandanus sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their fibrous texture. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is found in coastal and lowland areas."
