    "intro": "Paronychia capitata subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
