    "intro": "Physaliastrum yunnanense subsp. bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese physaliastrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
