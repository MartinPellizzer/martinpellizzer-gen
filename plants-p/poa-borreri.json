    "intro": "Poa borreri, commonly known as the Borreri's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that mature into seeds.
