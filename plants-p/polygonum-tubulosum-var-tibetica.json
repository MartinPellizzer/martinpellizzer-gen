    "intro": "Polygonum tubulosum var. tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens for its ornamental value."
