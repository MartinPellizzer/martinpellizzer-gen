It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Psiadia canescens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
