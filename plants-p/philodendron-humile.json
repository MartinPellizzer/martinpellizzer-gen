    "intro": "Philodendron humile, commonly known as the miniature philodendron, is a small, climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of other philodendron species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
