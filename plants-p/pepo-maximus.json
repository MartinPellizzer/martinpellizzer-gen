It is characterized by its large, thick-walled fruits that typically mature to a vibrant yellow or orange hue. The plant produces sprawling vines with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are often used in ornamental gardening due to their eye-catching appearance.
