    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. amayadori, commonly known as the Amayadori cherry, is a unique flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring form of the Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana, which is a hybrid between Prunus serrulata (Japanese cherry) and Prunus lannesiana (a species native to the Canary Islands). The Amayadori cherry is characterized by its striking, double-flowered blooms that appear in early spring. It is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and landscapes where its showy flowers add visual interest. This cultivar is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
