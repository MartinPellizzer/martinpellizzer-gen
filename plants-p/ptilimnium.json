    "intro": "Ptilimnium, commonly known as bladder grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures on their leaves, which are adaptations for water storage in arid environments. Ptilimnium species are typically found in sandy or disturbed soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. They produce small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and their seeds are dispersed by wind. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions."
