    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. parnellii, commonly known as the Parnell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecologically diverse habitats."
