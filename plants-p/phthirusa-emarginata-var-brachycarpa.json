    "intro": "Phthirusa emarginata var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phthirusa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruiting bodies are short and cylindrical, typical of the varietal name *brachycarpa*, meaning \"short fruit.\" Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
