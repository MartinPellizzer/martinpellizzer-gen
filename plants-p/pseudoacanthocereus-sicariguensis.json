    "intro": "Pseudoacanthocereus sicariguensis, commonly known as the Cactus of the Sierra de las Minas, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
