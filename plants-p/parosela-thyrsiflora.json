    "intro": "Parosela thyrsiflora, commonly known as the Canary Islands rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces yellow or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Parosela thyrsiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in mild climates."
