    "intro": "Pleopeltis matthewii, commonly known as the Matthew's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a rhizome that is typically covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually divided into numerous small pinnae, contributing to its delicate appearance. Pleopeltis matthewii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
