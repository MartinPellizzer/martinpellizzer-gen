The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture. Polystachya testuana requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
