    "intro": "Phyllanthus duidae, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
