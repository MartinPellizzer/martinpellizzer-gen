    "intro": "Polypodium lepigerum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium lepigerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
