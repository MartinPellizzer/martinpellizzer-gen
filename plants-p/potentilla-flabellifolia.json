    "intro": "Potentilla flabellifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into five oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
