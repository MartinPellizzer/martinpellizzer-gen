It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique structure and ecological role, it is an important species in the study of desert flora."
