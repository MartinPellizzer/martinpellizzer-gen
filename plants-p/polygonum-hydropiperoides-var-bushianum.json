It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its swollen nodes and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a reddish tint, and it produces tiny greenish-white flowers in late summer. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
