It is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year, resembling the appearance of a Christmas tree. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense mats. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, arching shape, often with a silvery underside. This species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
