It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its finely veined, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, slender fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's aromatic foliage and unique appearance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
