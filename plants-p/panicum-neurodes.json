    "intro": "Panicum neurodes, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, linear leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often pink to reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental and forage plant. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
