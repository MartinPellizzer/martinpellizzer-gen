    "intro": "Plantago pusilla var. major, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring upright, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. This species is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
