    "intro": "Potentilla argentea f. collina, commonly known as silver potentilla or mountain silverweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs that cover its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
