    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping almond tree, is a cultivar of the almond species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful, drooping form, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate mild shade."
