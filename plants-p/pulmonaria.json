It is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lungs, hence its common name. The flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and come in shades of blue, purple, and white. Pulmonaria species are perennial herbs that thrive in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and meadows. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental foliage and early spring blooms."
