    "intro": "Plantago major var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in moist to wet environments. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. This variant is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
