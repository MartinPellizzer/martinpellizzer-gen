    "intro": "Prunus mume var. praecocissima, commonly known as the early Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are edible but typically used in jams, wines, and traditional medicine. Its ornamental value is high due to its early blooming habit and delicate foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
