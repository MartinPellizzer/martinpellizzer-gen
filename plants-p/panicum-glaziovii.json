    "intro": "Panicum glaziovii, commonly known as Glaziov's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
