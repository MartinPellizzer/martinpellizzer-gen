    "intro": "Poinciana gilliesii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by flat, winged pods that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving the tree a feathery appearance."
