    "intro": "Panicum trachypus, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It produces wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or wetland areas. Panicum trachypus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
