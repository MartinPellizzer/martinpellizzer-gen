    "intro": "Pimpinella peregrina, commonly known as the wandering pepper or wild cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Pimpinella peregrina is also known for its peppery taste, which is similar to that of mustard."
