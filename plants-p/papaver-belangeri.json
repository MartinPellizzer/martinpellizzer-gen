    "intro": "Papaver belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its striking red petals and a distinctive, elongated seed pod. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include alternate, lance-shaped leaves and a taproot system, which help it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The seeds of Papaver belangeri are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its native habitat."
