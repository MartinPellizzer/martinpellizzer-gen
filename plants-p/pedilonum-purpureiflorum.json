    "intro": "Pedilonum purpureiflorum, commonly known as the purpleflowered pedilonum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet petals and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss, Pedilonum purpureiflorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
