    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles erubescens, commonly known as the crimson cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which intensifies during the autumn season. The plant produces small, sweet, and tart fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it blooms with clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The species is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its edible fruit."
