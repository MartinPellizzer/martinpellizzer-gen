    "intro": "Polygala ludwigiana, commonly known as the Ludwig's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Polygala ludwigiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
