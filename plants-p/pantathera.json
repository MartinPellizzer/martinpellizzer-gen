    "intro": "Pantathera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in specific, moist, pine rockland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique ability to photosynthesize through its roots. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pantathera is listed as an endangered species."
