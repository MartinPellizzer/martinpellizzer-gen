    "intro": "Pinus nobilis, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. The Aleppo pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
