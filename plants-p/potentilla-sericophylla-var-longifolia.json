    "intro": "Potentilla sericophylla var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
