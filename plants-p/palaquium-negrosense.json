    "intro": "Palaquium negrosense, commonly known as the Negros wax apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits with a waxy coating. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a white, starchy pulp, which is edible but has a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
