    "intro": "Polypodium rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium rufum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
