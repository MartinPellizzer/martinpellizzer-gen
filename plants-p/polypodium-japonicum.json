    "intro": "Polypodium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. Polypodium japonicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
