    "intro": "Pachygenium dolichorhizum, commonly known as the long-rooted thick-stemmed plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and long, tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in late spring to early summer."
