    "intro": "Penstemon multiflorus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon multiflorus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
