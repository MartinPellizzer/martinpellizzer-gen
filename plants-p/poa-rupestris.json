    "intro": "Poa rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Argentina. This perennial grass is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Poa rupestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
