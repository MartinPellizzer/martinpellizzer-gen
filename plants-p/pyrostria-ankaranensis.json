    "intro": "Pyrostria ankaranensis, commonly known as the Ankaranensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same individual. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical relic."
