    "intro": "Peridium bicolor var. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy two-colored cup, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned bracts, which range from white to pale yellow, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units upon maturity. Its leaves are typically finely divided and have a delicate, feathery texture. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
