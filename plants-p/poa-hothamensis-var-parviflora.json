    "intro": "Poa hothamensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hill grass, is a variant of the hill grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, pale blue to whitish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited distribution."
