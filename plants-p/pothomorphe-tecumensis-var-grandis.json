It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with contrasting yellow throats. Native to parts of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody.
