    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
