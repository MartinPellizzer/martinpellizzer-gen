    "intro": "Peucedanum depauperatum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine angelica, is a rare and slender herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, spicy scent, while its small white flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
