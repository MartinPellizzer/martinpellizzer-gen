    "intro": "Panicum pseudanceps, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and vibrant red to bronze-colored foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the fall and winter months. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
