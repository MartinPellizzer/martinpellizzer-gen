    "intro": "Pleopeltis conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
