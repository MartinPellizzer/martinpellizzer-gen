It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
