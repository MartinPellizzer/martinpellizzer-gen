It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy, red or pink bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Pavonia drummondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
