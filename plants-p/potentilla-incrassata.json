    "intro": "Potentilla incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common cinquefoil. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Potentilla incrassata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
