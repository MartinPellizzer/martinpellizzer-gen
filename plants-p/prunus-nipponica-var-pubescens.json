    "intro": "Prunus nipponica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese maple with pubescent leaves, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring delicate, often variegated foliage that changes color throughout the seasons. The leaves are typically pubescent, meaning they are covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, textured appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
