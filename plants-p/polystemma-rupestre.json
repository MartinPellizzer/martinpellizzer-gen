    "intro": "Polystemma rupestre, commonly known as the rock polystichum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it can tolerate poor soil conditions and limited moisture. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps to conserve water and protect the plant from harsh weather. Polystemma rupestre is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and resilience."
