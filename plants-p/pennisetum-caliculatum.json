    "intro": "Pennisetum caliculatum, commonly known as the blue oat grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and panicles that produce small, pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. Pennisetum caliculatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry environments."
