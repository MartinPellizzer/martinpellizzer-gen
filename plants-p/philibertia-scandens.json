    "intro": "Philibertia scandens, commonly known as the climbing filbert or sweet vernal grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in early spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular shell, and the plant is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Philibertia scandens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
