    "intro": "Peltogyne mexicana, commonly known as Mexican rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, bean-shaped seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
