    "intro": "Pimpinella carvifolia, commonly known as caraway leaf or wild caraway, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, dill, and fennel, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are similar to those of true caraway but are less commonly used in culinary applications. Pimpinella carvifolia is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in temperate climates."
