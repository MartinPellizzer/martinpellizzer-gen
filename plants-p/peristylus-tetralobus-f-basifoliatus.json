    "intro": "Peristylus tetralobus f. basifoliatus, commonly known as the basifoliate peristylus, is a rare and distinctive variant of the peristylus genus. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring broad, basifoliate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, facilitating vegetative propagation. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. This species is primarily found in specific tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
