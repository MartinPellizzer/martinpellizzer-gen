    "intro": "Prunus demissa f. rydbergii, commonly known as the Rydberg cherry, is a rare and compact form of the Prunus demissa species. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to less than 3 meters in height, and its dense, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a valuable plant for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
