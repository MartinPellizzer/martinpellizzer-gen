    "intro": "Phegopteris rugosula, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions across North America, particularly in rocky and woodland habitats. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on cliffs or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The rock polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
