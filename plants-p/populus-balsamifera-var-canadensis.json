    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. canadensis, commonly known as balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces catkins that release pollen in the spring, contributing to its role in wind pollination. Its sap, which is aromatic and sticky, has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes. The species is often found in wetlands, riparian areas, and other moist environments."
