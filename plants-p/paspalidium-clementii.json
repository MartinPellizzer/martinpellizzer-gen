    "intro": "Paspalidium clementii, commonly known as the Clement's grass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
