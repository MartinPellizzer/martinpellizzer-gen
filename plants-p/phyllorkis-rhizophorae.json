    "intro": "Phyllorkis rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove leaf gall midge, is a small insect that has a unique botanical relationship with mangrove trees. It is particularly associated with the roots of Rhizophora species, where it induces the formation of specialized plant galls. These galls serve as protective structures for the insect's larvae, providing both shelter and a source of nutrients. The plant's response to the insect's presence results in the development of abnormal growth patterns, which can affect the tree's structure. This interaction highlights the complex ecological relationships between insects and their host plants in coastal mangrove ecosystems."
