It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes."
