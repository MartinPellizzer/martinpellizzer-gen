It is characterized by its white to silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful form and adaptability to various soil types."
