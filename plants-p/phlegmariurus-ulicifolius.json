It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown stems. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. This moss plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
