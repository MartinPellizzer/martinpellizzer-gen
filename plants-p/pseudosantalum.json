    "intro": "Pseudosantalum, commonly known as the silky oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The genus includes several species, such as Pseudosantalum ellipticum and Pseudosantalum wightianum, which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Their ecological role is significant in forest ecosystems, where they contribute to biodiversity and nutrient cycling."
