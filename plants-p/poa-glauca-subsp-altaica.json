    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. altaica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive bluish tint that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contribute to its ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
