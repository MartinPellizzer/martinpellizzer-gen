It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces edible seeds that are used in some traditional cuisines. Pseudopteryxia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings."
