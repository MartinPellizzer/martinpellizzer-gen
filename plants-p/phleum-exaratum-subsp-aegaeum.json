It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
