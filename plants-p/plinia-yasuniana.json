It is native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife.
