    "intro": "Polypodium mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are leathery and deeply divided. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
