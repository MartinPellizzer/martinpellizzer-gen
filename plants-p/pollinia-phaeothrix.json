    "intro": "Pollinia phaeothrix, commonly known as the dark brown pollinia, is a unique type of plant structure found in certain orchid species. It consists of compact masses of pollen grains that are typically adhered together by a sticky substance. These pollinia are specialized for efficient pollination, as they are transferred en masse from one flower to another. The dark brown coloration of the pollinia is due to the high concentration of pigments within the pollen grains. This botanical feature plays a crucial role in the reproductive strategy of the orchid species that produce it."
