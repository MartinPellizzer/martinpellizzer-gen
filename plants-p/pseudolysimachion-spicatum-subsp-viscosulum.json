    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion spicatum subsp. viscosulum, commonly known as the sticky false lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. The subspecies is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with two lips, and it blooms during the summer months."
