    "intro": "Psyllium arborescens var. mascaensis, commonly known as the Mascaensis psyllium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system. Due to its potential medicinal and nutritional properties, it has attracted interest for further botanical and agricultural study."
