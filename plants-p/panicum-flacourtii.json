    "intro": "Panicum flacourtii, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves and panicle-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed sites. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, hairy seeds. Due to its hardy nature, Panicum flacourtii is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
