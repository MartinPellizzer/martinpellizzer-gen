    "intro": "Polypodium fraxinifolium var. articulatum, commonly known as the articulated cliff fern, is a variant of the common polypody found in rocky, humid environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that give it a unique, almost segmented appearance. The plant typically grows on cliffs, rock faces, or in shaded, moist areas where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
