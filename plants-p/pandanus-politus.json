    "intro": "Pandanus politus, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments. Pandanus politus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various species."
