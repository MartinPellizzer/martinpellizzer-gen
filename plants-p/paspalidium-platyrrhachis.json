    "intro": "Paspalidium platyrrhachis, commonly known as the flat-ribbed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves with a distinctive ribbed texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
