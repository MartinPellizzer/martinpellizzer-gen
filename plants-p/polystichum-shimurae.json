    "intro": "Polystichum shimurae, commonly known as the Shimura's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum shimurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
