    "intro": "Plagiobothrys collinus var. californicus, commonly known as the California narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune or coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
