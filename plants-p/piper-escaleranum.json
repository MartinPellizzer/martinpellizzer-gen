    "intro": "Piper escaleranum, commonly known as the mountain pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a distinct aromatic scent. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are followed by small, round berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine."
