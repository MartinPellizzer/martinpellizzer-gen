    "intro": "Pilea wightii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are often described as resembling small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea wightii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
