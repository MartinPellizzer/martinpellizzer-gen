    "intro": "Palimbia decussata, commonly known as the scarlet starling tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in warm climates. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
