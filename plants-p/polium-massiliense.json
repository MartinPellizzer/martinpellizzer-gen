    "intro": "Polium massiliense, commonly known as the Massiliense grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly France and Italy. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
