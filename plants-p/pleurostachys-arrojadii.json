    "intro": "Pleurostachys arrojadii, commonly known as the Arroja pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant belongs to the Pinaceae family and is distinguished by its unique, spiral arrangement of leaves along the branches. Its cones are small and typically hang in clusters, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
