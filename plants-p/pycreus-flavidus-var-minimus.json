    "intro": "Pycreus flavidus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow pycreus, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in specialized botanical gardens and is often cultivated for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
