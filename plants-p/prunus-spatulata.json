    "intro": "Prunus spatulata, commonly known as the flat-leaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its ovate, flat leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, dark red to black berries. Prunus spatulata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
