    "intro": "Premna coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf glorybower, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its rough, papery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its stems are woody and can become somewhat branched as the plant matures. Premna coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
