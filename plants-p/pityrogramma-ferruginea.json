    "intro": "Pityrogramma ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown or reddish hue, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pityrogramma ferruginea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
