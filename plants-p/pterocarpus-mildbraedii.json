    "intro": "Pterocarpus mildbraedii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
