    "intro": "Pelexia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
