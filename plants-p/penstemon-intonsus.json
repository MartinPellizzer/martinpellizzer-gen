    "intro": "Penstemon intonsus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon intonsus is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bumblebees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
