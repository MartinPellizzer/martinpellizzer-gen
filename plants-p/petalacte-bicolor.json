    "intro": "Petalacte bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored petals, which typically feature a white base and a pink or red tip. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with fine, silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are broad and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Petalacte bicolor is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
