    "intro": "Pteris foemina var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a distinctive bifurcated or trifurcated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to form dense, compact clumps. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in both indoor and outdoor settings."
