    "intro": "Potentilla opaciformis f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular potentilla, is a variant of the opaciformis species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other forms of Potentilla. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
