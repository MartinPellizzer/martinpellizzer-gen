    "intro": "Phaius subtrilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is a pseudobulbous plant, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
