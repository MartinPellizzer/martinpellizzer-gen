    "intro": "Paradisanthus neglectus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread in open, disturbed habitats."
