    "intro": "Potentilla leuconota var. morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, serrated leaves that are typically silver-green in color, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
