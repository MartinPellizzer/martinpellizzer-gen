    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum maccannii, commonly known as the MacCann's paraprasophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
