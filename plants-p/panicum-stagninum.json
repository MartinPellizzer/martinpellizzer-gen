    "intro": "Panicum stagninum, commonly known as swamp millet, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. Panicum stagninum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
