    "intro": "Papaver henrici, commonly known as the Henrici's poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers with bright red petals and a prominent black center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
