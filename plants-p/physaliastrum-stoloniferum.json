It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Physaliastrum stoloniferum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
