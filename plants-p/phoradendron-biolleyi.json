    "intro": "Phoradendron biolleyi, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthetic support through its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto host trees. Phoradendron biolleyi is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
