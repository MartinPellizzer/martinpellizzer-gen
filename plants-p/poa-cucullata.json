    "intro": "Poa cucullata, commonly known as the hooded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a panicle shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Poa cucullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
