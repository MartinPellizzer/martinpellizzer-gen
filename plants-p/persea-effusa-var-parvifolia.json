    "intro": "Persea effusa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Persea effusa. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its fruit is a smooth, green to yellowish avocado-like berry. The leaves are leathery and have a slight aromatic scent, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible fruit in certain regions."
