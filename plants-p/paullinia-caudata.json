    "intro": "Paullinia caudata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia caudata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical rainforests. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
