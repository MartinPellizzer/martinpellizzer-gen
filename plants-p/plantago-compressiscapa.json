It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
