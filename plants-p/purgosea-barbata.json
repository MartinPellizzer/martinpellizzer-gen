It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are hairy and often have a spurred shape, giving it its common name. Purgosea barbata thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
