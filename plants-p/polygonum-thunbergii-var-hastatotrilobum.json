    "intro": "Polygonum thunbergii var. hastatotrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
