    "intro": "Pedicularis pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies. Pedicularis pectinata is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationships with host plants."
