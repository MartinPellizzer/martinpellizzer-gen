    "intro": "Planchonia, commonly known as the kauri tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, primarily found in tropical regions of the Pacific. These trees are characterized by their tall, straight trunks and broad, feather-like leaves. They play a significant role in their native ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity. Planchonia species are also valued for their durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and craftsmanship. However, many species face threats due to habitat loss and climate change."
