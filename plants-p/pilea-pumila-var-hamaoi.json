    "intro": "Pilea pumila var. hamaoi, commonly known as the Japanese baby tears, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to Japan. It features small, round, waxy leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are rarely seen, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and dense foliage make it ideal for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
