    "intro": "Plumbagella micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Plumbagella micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
