    "intro": "Phreatia elata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant features long, narrow pseudobulbs and produces striking, pendulous flowers with pale yellow petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates. Due to habitat loss, Phreatia elata is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
