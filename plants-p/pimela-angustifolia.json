    "intro": "Pimela angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pimela angustifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
