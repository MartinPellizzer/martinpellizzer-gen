    "intro": "Phoradendron costaricense, commonly known as the Costarican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America. It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the family Fabaceae, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various bird species."
