    "intro": "Pleurogramme nuda, commonly known as the naked pleurogramme, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
