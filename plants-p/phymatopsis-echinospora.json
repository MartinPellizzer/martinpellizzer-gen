    "intro": "Phymatopsis echinospora, commonly known as the prickly phymatopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are covered in small, sharp tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and small animals."
