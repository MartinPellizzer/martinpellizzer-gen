    "intro": "Poa prolifera, commonly known as the spreading meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often spread along the ground through rhizomes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to form dense mats, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
