It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
