    "intro": "Pteris hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris hildebrandtii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
