    "intro": "Pterostylis platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which features a single, hood-like labellum that is distinctly flattened. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and heathlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, due to their specialized structure. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems."
