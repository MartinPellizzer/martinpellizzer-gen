    "intro": "Peucedanum gallicum, commonly known as French parsley or cow parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used as a culinary herb. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are white or pale blue and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds, known as \"anise\" in some regions, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
