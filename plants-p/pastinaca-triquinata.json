    "intro": "Pastinaca triquinata, commonly known as the three-lobed scorzonera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, brownish fruits. Its root system is fibrous and not particularly edible, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Pastinaca triquinata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
