    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. argentea, commonly known as the silver Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue needles. The foliage consists of long, slender needles that are coated with a dense layer of fine, waxy crystals, giving the plant its striking silver appearance. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in cooler, well-drained soils. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a conical shape and a dense, pyramidal crown. The silver Scots pine is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
