    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. pura, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, cone-like fruits that are typically white or light-colored, which distinguish it from other pine species. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for over 1,000 years, making it a long-lived conifer. Its needles are typically short and bluish-green, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture."
