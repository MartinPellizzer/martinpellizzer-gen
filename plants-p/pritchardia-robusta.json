    "intro": "Pritchardia robusta, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 4 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into three-winged fruits, known as coconuts. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important plant in coastal areas. The coconut palm is widely cultivated for its fruit, which contains both water and edible flesh."
