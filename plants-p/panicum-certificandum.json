It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
