    "intro": "Podanthum floribundum, commonly known as the showy podanthum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with trailing stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Podanthum floribundum is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its striking floral display."
