    "intro": "Panicum recognitum, commonly known as the recognized panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Panicum recognitum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
