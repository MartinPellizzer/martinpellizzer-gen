It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Pilosella fennica produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
