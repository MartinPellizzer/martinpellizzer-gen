    "intro": "Populus rotundifolia var. bonatii, commonly known as the Bonati's poplar, is a variant of the round-leaf poplar native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and rivers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
