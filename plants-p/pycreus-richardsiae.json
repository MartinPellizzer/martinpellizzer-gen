    "intro": "Pycreus richardsiae, commonly known as the Richardsia orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
