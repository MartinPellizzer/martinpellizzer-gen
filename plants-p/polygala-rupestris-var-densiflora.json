    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
