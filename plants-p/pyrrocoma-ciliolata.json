    "intro": "Pyrrocoma ciliolata, commonly known as the woolly pygmy grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Pyrrocoma ciliolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
