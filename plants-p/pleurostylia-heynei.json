    "intro": "Pleurostylia heynei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
