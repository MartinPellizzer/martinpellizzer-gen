It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive spiny leaves that provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Pasania hystrix is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
