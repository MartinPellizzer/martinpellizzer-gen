    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria marginata, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
