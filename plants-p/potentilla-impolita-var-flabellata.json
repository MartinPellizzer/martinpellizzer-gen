    "intro": "Potentilla impolita var. flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in rockeries or alpine gardens."
