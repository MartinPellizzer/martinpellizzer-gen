    "intro": "Plananthus selago, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Plananthus selago is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
