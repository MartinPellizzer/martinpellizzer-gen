    "intro": "Phleum velutinum, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves that give it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Velvet fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
