    "intro": "Polythecium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that grows on decaying wood. It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped caps and a sponge-like, porous underside. The fungus is typically found in temperate regions and is often associated with hardwood trees. Its fruiting bodies are usually pale to dark brown and can be found in clusters. Polythecium obovatum plays a role in decomposing wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
