    "intro": "Pelargonium karooescens, commonly known as the Karoo geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
