    "intro": "Primula nivalis sinopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered snow primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often with a violet tinge. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in cool, shaded gardens."
