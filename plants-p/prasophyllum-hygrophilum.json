    "intro": "Prasophyllum hygrophilum, commonly known as the swamp leek, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its moist, often swampy habitat. The plant produces a tall flowering stem bearing a single spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
