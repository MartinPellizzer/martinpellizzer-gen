It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, spherical fruits. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its fruits, which are small and often clustered, serve as a means of seed dispersal through attachment to animals or clothing. This plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles."
