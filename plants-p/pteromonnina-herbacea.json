    "intro": "Pteromonnina herbacea, commonly known as the slender pteromonnina, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth habit. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its low-growing nature, it is often used in ground cover or as a filler in mixed plantings."
