    "intro": "Potentilla supina f. ternata, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate habit and dense, mat-forming growth. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are simple, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
