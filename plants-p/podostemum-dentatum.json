    "intro": "Podostemum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed podostemum, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are adapted to cling to submerged rocks. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, making it unique among its relatives. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in rocky substrates and absorbing nutrients from the water. Podostemum dentatum is considered an indicator species for clean, oxygen-rich aquatic environments."
