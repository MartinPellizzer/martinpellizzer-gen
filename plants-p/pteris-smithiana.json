    "intro": "Pteris smithiana, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris smithiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
