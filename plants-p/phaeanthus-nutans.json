    "intro": "Phaeanthus nutans, commonly known as the nodding phaeanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its \"nodding\" appearance. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
