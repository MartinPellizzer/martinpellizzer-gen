    "intro": "Pteris subquinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris subquinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
