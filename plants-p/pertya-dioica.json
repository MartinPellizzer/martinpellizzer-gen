It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like odor. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.
