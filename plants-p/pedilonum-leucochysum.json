    "intro": "Pedilonum leucochysum, commonly known as the white-haired pedilonum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to white, often appearing in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pedilonum leucochysum is considered a vulnerable species."
