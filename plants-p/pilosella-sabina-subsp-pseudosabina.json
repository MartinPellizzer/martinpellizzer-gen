    "intro": "Pilosella sabina subsp. pseudosabina, commonly known as the European mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
