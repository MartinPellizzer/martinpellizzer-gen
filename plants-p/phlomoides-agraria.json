    "intro": "Phlomoides agraria, commonly known as field phlomis, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Phlomoides agraria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
