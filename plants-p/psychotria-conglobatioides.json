    "intro": "Psychotria conglobatioides, commonly known as the \"Congo psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
