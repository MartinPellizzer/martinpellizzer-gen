    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. minoriflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features a dense mat of dark green, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are characteristic of the Potentilla genus. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Potentilla recta."
