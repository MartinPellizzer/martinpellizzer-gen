    "intro": "Potameia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved potameia, is a perennial shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
