    "intro": "Pernettya leucocarpa var. gayana, commonly known as the white-fruited cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces white or pale yellow berries that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. This variant is distinguished by its pale-colored fruits, which set it apart from other varieties within the Pernettya genus."
