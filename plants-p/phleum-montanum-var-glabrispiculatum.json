    "intro": "Phleum montanum var. glabrispiculatum, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) spikelets, which give it its specific epithet."
