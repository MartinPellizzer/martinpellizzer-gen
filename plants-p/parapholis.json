    "intro": "Parapholis, commonly known as the grass of the genus Parapholis, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Parapholis species are generally short-lived and have a clump-forming growth habit. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are important for soil stabilization and as a food source for certain invertebrates."
