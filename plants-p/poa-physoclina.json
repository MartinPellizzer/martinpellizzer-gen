    "intro": "Poa physoclina, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of foliage that form a cushion-like structure, which helps it survive in harsh environments. This plant is native to southern South America, particularly in the Andes region, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats. Poa physoclina has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold and arid conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
