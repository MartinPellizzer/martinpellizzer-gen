    "intro": "Panicularia distans, commonly known as the slender panicled grass, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Panicularia distans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range."
