    "intro": "Psilotum, commonly known as the whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are highly simplified compared to more advanced plants. Psilotum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and temperate forests. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution."
