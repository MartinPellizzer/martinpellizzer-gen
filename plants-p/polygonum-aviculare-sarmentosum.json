    "intro": "[WRONG START] Polygonum aviculare sarmentosus, commonly known as creeping smartweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and stamens, and they bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
