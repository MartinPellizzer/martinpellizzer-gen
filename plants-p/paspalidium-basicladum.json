    "intro": "Paspalidium basicladum, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalidium basicladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
