    "intro": "Psilochilus vallecaucanus, commonly known as the Vallecaucan orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
