    "intro": "Podalyria cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive cordate base. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, often with a white throat, during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
