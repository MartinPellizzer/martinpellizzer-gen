It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pentamerous flowers that are typically pink or white.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
