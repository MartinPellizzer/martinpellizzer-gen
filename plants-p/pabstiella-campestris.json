    "intro": "Pabstiella campestris, commonly known as the field pabstiella, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant species. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to parts of Europe and has limited distribution due to its specific ecological requirements. Due to its rarity, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
