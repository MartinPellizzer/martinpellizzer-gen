    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. gotlandica, commonly known as the Gotland spruce, is a rare subspecies of the white spruce native to the island of Gotland in Sweden. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical white spruce. Its cones are typically cylindrical and contain two seeds, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree. This subspecies is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
