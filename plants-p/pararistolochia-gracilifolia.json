It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds enclosed in a thick, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
