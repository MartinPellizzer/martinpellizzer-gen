    "intro": "Plantago subulata subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
