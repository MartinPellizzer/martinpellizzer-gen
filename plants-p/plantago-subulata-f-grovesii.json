    "intro": "Plantago subulata f. grovesii, commonly known as the Groves' narrowleaf plantain, is a subspecies of the common plantain native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender spikes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
