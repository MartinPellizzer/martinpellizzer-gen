    "intro": "Pyrus bumthangensis, commonly known as the Bhutanese pear, is a rare species native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan. It is a deciduous tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically yellow or green when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
