    "intro": "Pavonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy and branched, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Pavonia glandulosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
