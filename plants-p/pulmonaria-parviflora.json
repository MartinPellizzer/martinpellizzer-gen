    "intro": "Pulmonaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features striking, spotted leaves that range in color from silver to deep green, often with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of pink or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Pulmonaria parviflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit."
