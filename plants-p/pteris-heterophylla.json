    "intro": "Pteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnately compound or simple, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
