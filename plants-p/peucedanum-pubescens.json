    "intro": "Peucedanum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, ribbed fruit, typical of the genus. Peucedanum pubescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
