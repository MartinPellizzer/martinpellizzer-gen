    "intro": "Penicillanthemum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Penicillanthemum species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
