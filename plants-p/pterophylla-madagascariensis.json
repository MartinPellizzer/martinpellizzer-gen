    "intro": "Pterophylla madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
