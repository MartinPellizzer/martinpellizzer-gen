    "intro": "Pteris notholaenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Pteris notholaenoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
