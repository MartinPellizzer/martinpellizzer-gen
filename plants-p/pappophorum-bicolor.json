It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned inflorescence, with the upper portion typically lighter in color than the lower part. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
