It is characterized by its intricate, lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
