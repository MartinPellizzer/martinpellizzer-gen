    "intro": "Phyllanthus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique, umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a compact rosette, which helps it retain moisture. Phyllanthus nubigenus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
