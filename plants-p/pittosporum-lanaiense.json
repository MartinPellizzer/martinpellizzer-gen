    "intro": "Pittosporum lanaiense, commonly known as Lanai Pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats on the island. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
