    "intro": "Pisonia corniculata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, bright red or orange bracts that resemble coral, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and urban landscapes. Pisonia corniculata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting display."
