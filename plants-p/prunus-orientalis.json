    "intro": "Prunus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cherry or Japanese flowering cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the emergence of its oval, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, edible fruits called cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes. Prunus orientalis is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
