    "intro": "Puya killipii, commonly known as the Killip's torch cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear bright yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Puya killipii is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils."
