    "intro": "Phyllachne, commonly known as the narrow-leaf daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and narrow, linear leaves. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Phyllachne species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in leaf shape and flower color."
