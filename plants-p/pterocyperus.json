    "intro": "Pterocyperus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, often triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically grow in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and are native to tropical and subtropical regions. Pterocyperus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Their botanical features make them important in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
