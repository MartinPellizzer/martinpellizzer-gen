    "intro": "Pitcairnia riparia, commonly known as the stream pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
