It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Phoebe oleifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
