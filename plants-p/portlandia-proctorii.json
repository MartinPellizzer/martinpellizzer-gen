    "intro": "Portlandia proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's pincushion, is a rare and endemic plant found in specific regions of Oregon. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and densely packed, contributing to its cushion-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
