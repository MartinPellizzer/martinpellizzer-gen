    "intro": "Pinguicula albida, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are small and often white or pale pink, and they bloom during the spring or early summer. Pinguicula albida is adapted to thrive in shady conditions and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
