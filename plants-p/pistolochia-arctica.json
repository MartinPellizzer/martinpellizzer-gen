    "intro": "Pistolochia arctica, commonly known as Arctic pistolpod, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or white. The plant grows close to the ground, often in rocky or sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
