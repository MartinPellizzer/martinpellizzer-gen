It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
