It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
