    "intro": "Primula petrocallis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved primrose, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are typically smooth and oval-shaped, with a glossy surface. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
