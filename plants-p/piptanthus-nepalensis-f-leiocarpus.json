    "intro": "Piptanthus nepalensis f. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-carpel piptanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and bipinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique botanical features include smooth, leathery pods and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
