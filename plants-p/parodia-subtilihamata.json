    "intro": "Parodia subtilihamata, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and unique features, it is a popular choice among succulent collectors."
