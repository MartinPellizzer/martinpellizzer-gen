    "intro": "Pastinaca cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarp snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces unique, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology."
