    "intro": "Panax forsteri, commonly known as the Forster ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its small, heart-shaped leaves. Its roots are highly valued for their medicinal properties, similar to those of Panax ginseng. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected in several regions."
