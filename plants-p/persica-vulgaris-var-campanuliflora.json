    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. campanuliflora, commonly known as the campanuliflora peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure. It features bell-shaped flowers, which give it its common name, and blooms in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its fruit is typically smaller than standard peaches and has a more intense flavor. This variety is valued for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruit."
