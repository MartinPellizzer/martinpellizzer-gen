    "intro": "Psychopterys rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as streams and rivers, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the substrate, and its fronds are delicate, with a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Psychopterys rivularis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
