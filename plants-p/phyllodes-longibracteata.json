    "intro": "Phyllodes longibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features long, narrow phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves, but are actually modified stems. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in spikes, typical of many wattles. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across southern Australia."
