    "intro": "Populus laevigata, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus laevigata is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
