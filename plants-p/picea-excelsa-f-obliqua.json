    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving branches and narrow, lance-shaped needles that are a distinguishing feature of this form. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its cones are typically small and reddish-brown, maturing in the second year. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
