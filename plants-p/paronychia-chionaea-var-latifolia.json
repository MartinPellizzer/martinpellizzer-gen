    "intro": "Paronychia chionaea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf snowbush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its frost-resistant nature allows it to survive in colder climates, adding ornamental value to alpine or coastal landscapes."
