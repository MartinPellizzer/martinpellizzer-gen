    "intro": "Pterophylla exigua, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat."
