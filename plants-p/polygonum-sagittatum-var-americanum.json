It features heart-shaped leaves that are often arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
