    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. acutisquama, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard Pinus pinaster. The cones of this variety are often longer and more elongated, contributing to its distinct appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This variety is valued for its timber and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
