    "intro": "Potentilla friesenii, commonly known as the Friesen's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense mat of small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
