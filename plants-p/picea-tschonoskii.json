    "intro": "Picea tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue-green foliage with a waxy coating. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Picea tschonoskii is adapted to high altitudes and cold climates, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems."
