    "intro": "Portulaca meyeri var. rodrigoi, commonly known as Mexican Ice Plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the morning and closing by midday. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
