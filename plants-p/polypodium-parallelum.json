    "intro": "Polypodium parallelum, commonly known as the parallel fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in a parallel arrangement. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. Polypodium parallelum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
