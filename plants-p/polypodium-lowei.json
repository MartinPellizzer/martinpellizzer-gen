    "intro": "Polypodium lowei, commonly known as the Hawaiian cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Polypodium lowei plays an important ecological role in the unique flora of Hawaii."
