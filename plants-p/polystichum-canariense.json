    "intro": "Polystichum canariense, commonly known as the Canary fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum canariense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
