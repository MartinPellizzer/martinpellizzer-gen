    "intro": "Pulmonaria \u00d7 ovalis, commonly known as the oval lungwort, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pulmonaria officinalis and Pulmonaria brandegeana. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its striking, spotted foliage that ranges from green to blue-green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting foliage and early blooming habit."
