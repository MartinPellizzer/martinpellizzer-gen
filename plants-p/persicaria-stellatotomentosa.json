It is characterized by its stout, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
