    "intro": "Polygonum triangulare, commonly known as the triangular knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and an ornamental plant. The species is notable for its adaptability and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
