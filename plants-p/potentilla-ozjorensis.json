    "intro": "Potentilla ozjorensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Potentilla ozjorensis is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in rocky soils."
