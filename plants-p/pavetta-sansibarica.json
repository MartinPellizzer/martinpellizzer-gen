    "intro": "Pavetta sansibarica, commonly known as East African pavetta, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Pavetta sansibarica is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shores and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat."
