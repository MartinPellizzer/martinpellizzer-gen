    "intro": "Physematium \u00d7 kansanum, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
