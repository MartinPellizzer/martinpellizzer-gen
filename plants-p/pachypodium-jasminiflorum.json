    "intro": "Pachypodium jasminiflorum, commonly known as the jasmine-flowered pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, providing protection from herbivores. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
