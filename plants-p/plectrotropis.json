    "intro": "Plectrotropis, commonly known as the white-flowered plectrotropis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically opposite and simple, with a variety of shapes depending on the species. Plectrotropis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. They are often found in woodland or shrubland habitats, where they contribute to local biodiversity."
