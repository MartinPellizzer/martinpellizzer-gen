    "intro": "Peganum, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where it thrives in dry, saline soils. Peganum species are often used in traditional medicine and have also been studied for their potential ecological roles in desert environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert flora."
