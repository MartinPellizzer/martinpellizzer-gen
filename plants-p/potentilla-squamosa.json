    "intro": "Potentilla squamosa, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scaly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla squamosa is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
