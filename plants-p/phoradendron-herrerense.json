    "intro": "Phoradendron herrerense, commonly known as the Herrer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae. It primarily inhabits the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Celtis*, in its native range of Central America. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system. Its small, white or pale green leaves are often clustered along the stems, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that disperses its sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees."
