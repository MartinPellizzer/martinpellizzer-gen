    "intro": "Prasophyllum baueri, commonly known as the dwarf leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
