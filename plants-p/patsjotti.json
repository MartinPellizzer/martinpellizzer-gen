    "intro": "Patsjotti, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking, pale purple or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is listed as endangered in several states."
