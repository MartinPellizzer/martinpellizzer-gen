    "intro": "Phleum alpinum proles commutatum, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas."
