    "intro": "Phyllopodium rupestre, commonly known as the rock phyllo, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its rosette growth pattern helps it anchor to rocky surfaces and withstand harsh weather conditions. Phyllopodium rupestre is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
