    "intro": "Polypodium hemitomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
