    "intro": "Panicum kuhlmannii, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which results from its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in coastal areas. Silver hairgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
