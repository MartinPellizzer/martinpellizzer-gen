    "intro": "Paeonia corallina f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white peony, is a unique variant of the coral root peony. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with its deep green, heart-shaped leaves. This form is notable for its lack of the typical red or pink hues found in the standard variety of Paeonia corallina. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically growing in woodland or shaded areas. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct coloration and its role in horticultural diversity within the peony family."
