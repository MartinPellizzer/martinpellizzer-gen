    "intro": "Platanthera susannae, commonly known as the Susan's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and bogs, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. It has a slender, rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
