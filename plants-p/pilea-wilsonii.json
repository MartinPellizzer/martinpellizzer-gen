    "intro": "Pilea wilsonii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight purplish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea wilsonii is valued for its attractive foliage and ease of care, though it is not typically propagated by seed."
