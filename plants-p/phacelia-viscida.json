    "intro": "Phacelia viscida, commonly known as sticky phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Phacelia viscida is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects."
