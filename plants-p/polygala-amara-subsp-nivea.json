    "intro": "Polygala amara subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, and it produces small, elongated pods containing seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
