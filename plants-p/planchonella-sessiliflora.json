    "intro": "Planchonella sessiliflora, commonly known as the slender leaf hibiscus, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually glabrous and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellow fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Planchonella sessiliflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
