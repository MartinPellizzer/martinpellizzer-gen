    "intro": "Pyrola virgata, commonly known as the white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its clustered, leathery leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Pyrola virgata thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small forest creatures."
