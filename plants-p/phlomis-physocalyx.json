    "intro": "Phlomis physocalyx, commonly known as narrow-leaved plumeless tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are lance-shaped. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
