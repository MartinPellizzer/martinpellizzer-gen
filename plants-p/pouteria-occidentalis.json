    "intro": "Pouteria occidentalis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains a single large, edible seed surrounded by a hard shell. The seed, known as a Brazil nut, is rich in oils and proteins, making it a valuable commodity. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season to produce its characteristic nuts."
