    "intro": "Pterolepis pumila var. procera, commonly known as the tall dwarf lichen, is a unique variant of the dwarf lichen species. It is characterized by its compact, crust-like growth form, typically found on rocky surfaces in arid environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green coloration, with a dense thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It is a non-photosynthetic organism, relying on its symbiotic association with algae for nutrients. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems."
