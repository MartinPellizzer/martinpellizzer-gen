    "intro": "Porpax moniliformis, commonly known as the chain fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a chain. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, linear leaves that form a rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The chain fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
