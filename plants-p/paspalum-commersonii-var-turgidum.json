    "intro": "Paspalum commersonii var. turgidum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
