    "intro": "Parodia bermejoensis, commonly known as the Bermejo pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is a low-growing, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after plant among cactus enthusiasts."
