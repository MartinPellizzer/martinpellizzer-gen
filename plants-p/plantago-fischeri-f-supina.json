    "intro": "Plantago fischeri f. supina, commonly known as the cushion plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
