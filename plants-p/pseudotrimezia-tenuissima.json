    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia tenuissima, commonly known as the slender pseudotrimezia, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the cool, moist environments of its alpine and subalpine habitats."
