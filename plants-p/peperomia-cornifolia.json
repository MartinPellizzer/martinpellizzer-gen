    "intro": "Peperomia cornifolia, commonly known as the Shingle plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, waxy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a textured surface that resembles shingles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia cornifolia is relatively low-maintenance and well-suited for container growing."
