    "intro": "Parahebe polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
