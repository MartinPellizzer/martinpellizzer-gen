    "intro": "Podocarpus annamiensis, commonly known as the Annamite podocarp, is a coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam and Laos. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically needle-like, and it is valued for its durable wood, though it faces threats from habitat loss and overexploitation."
