    "intro": "Piper commutatum, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red and eventually to black as they mature. The dried, unripe berries are the source of the spice black pepper, which is widely used in global cuisine. Its botanical features make it an important crop in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
