    "intro": "Polypodium boothii, commonly known as the Booth's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
