    "intro": "Pitcairnia torresiana, commonly known as the Torresiana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in humid environments. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy coating, and it produces striking red or orange flowers. Pitcairnia torresiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions."
