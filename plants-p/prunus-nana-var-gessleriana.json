    "intro": "Prunus nana var. gessleriana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Gessler's dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries in late summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal. This variety is hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8 and thrives in well-drained soil."
