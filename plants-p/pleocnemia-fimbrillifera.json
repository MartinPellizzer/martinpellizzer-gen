It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are bipinnate, with fine, hair-like structures along the margins, giving it a silky appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
