    "intro": "Polystachya retusiloba, commonly known as the woolly spikegrass, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Polystachya retusiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
