    "intro": "Potentilla pumila f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy species adapted to extreme climates."
