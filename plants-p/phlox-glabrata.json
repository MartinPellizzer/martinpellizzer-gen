    "intro": "Phlox glabrata, commonly known as sand phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Phlox glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in ecological restoration projects."
