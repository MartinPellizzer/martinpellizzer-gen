    "intro": "Parosela parryi, commonly known as the Parry's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss, Parosela parryi is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
