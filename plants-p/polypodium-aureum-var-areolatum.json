    "intro": "Polypodium aureum var. areolatum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium."
