    "intro": "Platanthera orchidis, commonly known as the grass piper, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to various regions in Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and the flowers are often clustered in a spike. Platanthera orchidis is noted for its ecological significance, supporting specific pollinators and serving as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
