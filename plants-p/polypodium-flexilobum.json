    "intro": "Polypodium flexilobum, commonly known as the flexible fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually leathery and have a glossy appearance, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
