    "intro": "Paspalum concavum, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct concave midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, pale flowers. Paspalum concavum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
