    "intro": "Peteniodendron durlandii, commonly known as the Durland's peteniodendron, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged roots that anchor it in the sediment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
