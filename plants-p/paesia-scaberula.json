    "intro": "Paesia scaberula, commonly known as the roughleaf paesia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by elliptical, dry fruits. Paesia scaberula is often found in shaded areas and is considered an indicator species for early successional forests."
