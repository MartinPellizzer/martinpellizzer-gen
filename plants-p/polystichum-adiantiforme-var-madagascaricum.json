    "intro": "Polystichum adiantiforme var. madagascaricum, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, which helps it absorb nutrients and moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
