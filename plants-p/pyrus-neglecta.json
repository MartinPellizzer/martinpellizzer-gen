    "intro": "Pyrus neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and features broad, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Pyrus neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in local ecosystems."
