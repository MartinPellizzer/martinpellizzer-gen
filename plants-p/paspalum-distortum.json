    "intro": "Paspalum distortum, commonly known as the twisted grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that often curve and twist, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Paspalum distortum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
