    "intro": "Parodia setifera var. cabracorralensis, commonly known as the Cabracorralensis Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
