    "intro": "Potentilla kotschyana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
