    "intro": "Primula vaginata subsp. eucyclia, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. The subspecies eucyclia is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to other forms of Primula vaginata."
