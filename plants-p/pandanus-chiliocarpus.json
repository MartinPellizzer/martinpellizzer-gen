It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in its native habitats."
