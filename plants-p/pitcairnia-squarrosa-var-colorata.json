It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
