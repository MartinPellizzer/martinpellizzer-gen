    "intro": "Polystachya colombiana, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces long, pendulous spikes of flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow or green bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Polystachya colombiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
