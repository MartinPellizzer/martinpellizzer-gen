    "intro": "Primula rubra, commonly known as the red primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals, which are typically arranged in a cluster at the top of a hairy stem. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of downy hair. Primula rubra thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats."
