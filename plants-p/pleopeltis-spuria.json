    "intro": "Pleopeltis spuria, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pleopeltis spuria is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid climates."
