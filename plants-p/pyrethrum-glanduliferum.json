    "intro": "Pyrethrum glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow ray florets and dark purple disk florets. The plant produces a fine, powdery substance called pyrethrin, which is used in natural insecticides. Its leaves are narrow and covered in glandular hairs that secrete the active compounds. Pyrethrum glanduliferum thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pest-control properties."
