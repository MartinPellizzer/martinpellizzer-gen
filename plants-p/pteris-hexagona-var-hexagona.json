    "intro": "Pteris hexagona var. hexagona, commonly known as the hexagonal water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hexagonal-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant, delicate appearance."
