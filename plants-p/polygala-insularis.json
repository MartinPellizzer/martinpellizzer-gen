    "intro": "Polygala insularis, commonly known as the island milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with distinctive, often pink or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Polygala insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
