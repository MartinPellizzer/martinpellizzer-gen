    "intro": "Pedilanthus myrsifolius, commonly known as the red sandalwood or bloodwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its thick, aromatic wood and striking red bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
