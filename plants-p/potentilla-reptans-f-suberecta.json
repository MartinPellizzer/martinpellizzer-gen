    "intro": "Potentilla reptans f. suberecta, commonly known as the upright creeping cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies for its astringent properties. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
