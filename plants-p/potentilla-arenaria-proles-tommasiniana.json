    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria proles tommasiniana, commonly known as the Tommasinian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in alpine or coastal environments where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
