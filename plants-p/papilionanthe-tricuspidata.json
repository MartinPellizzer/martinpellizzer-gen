It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
