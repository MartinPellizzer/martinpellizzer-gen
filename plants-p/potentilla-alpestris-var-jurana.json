    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. jurana, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically features bright yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to the alpine flora. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
