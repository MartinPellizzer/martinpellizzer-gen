    "intro": "Polypodium laterepens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid environments with partial shade, making it well-suited for shaded woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
