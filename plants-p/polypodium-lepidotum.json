    "intro": "Polypodium lepidotum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium lepidotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
