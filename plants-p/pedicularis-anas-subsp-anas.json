    "intro": "Pedicularis anas subsp. anas, commonly known as the water h\u7f42\u7c9f, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to alpine regions of Europe. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found near water bodies in mountainous areas. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
