    "intro": "Peixotoa lateritia, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Peixotoa lateritia is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal environments."
