    "intro": "Pterocarpus grandis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils. Pterocarpus grandis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
