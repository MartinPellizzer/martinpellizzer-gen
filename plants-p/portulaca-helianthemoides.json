    "intro": "Portulaca helianthemoides, commonly known as the sun rose or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Portulaca helianthemoides is well adapted to hot, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils or disturbed areas."
