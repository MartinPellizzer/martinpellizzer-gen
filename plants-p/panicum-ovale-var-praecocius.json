    "intro": "Panicum ovale var. praecocius, commonly known as early panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is characterized by its early flowering habit, often blooming before the main season of other panicgrass varieties. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in prairie and meadow ecosystems."
