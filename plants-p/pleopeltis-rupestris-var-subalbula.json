    "intro": "Pleopeltis rupestris var. subalbula, commonly known as the white-stippled rock fern, is a varietal form of the rock fern Pleopeltis rupestris. It is characterized by its pale, waxy undersides on the fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its leaves are leathery and have a dense, compact structure, which helps it retain moisture. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity."
