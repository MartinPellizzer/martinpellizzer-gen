It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods that mature in the fall. Podalyria sparsiflora is native to South Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
