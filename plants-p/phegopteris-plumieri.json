    "intro": "Phegopteris plumieri, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
