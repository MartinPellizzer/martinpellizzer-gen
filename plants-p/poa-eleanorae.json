    "intro": "Poa eleanorae, commonly known as Eleanor's bentgrass, is a rare grass species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa eleanorae is considered a vulnerable species."
