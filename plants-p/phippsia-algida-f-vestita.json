    "intro": "Phippsia algida f. vestita, commonly known as the alpine phippsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
