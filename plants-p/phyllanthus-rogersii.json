    "intro": "Phyllanthus rogersii, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. Phyllanthus rogersii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
