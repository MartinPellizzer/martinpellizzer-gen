It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal coating, which aids in nutrient absorption. Pleurothallis caniceps is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
