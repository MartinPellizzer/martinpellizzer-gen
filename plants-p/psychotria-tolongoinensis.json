    "intro": "Psychotria tolongoinensis, commonly known as the Toloango poison vine, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and is often avoided by both animals and humans."
