    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. explanata, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, streambanks, and meadows."
