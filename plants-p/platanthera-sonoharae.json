    "intro": "Platanthera sonoharae, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that are arranged in a loose, trailing spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It has lance-shaped leaves and a slender, wiry stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
