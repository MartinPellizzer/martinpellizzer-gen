    "intro": "Polyalthia crinita, commonly known as the silky tree or white silk cotton tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, silky flowers that give it its common name. These flowers are followed by woody, spiky capsules containing fluffy, cotton-like seeds. Polyalthia crinita is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
