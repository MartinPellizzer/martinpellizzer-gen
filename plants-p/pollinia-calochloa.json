    "intro": "Pollinia calochloa, commonly known as the orchid bee pollinia. It is a unique structure found in certain orchid species, consisting of compact masses of pollen grains held together by a sticky, viscid substance. These pollinia are typically transferred en masse from one flower to another by pollinators, primarily bees. The structure of pollinia calochloa is adapted for efficient pollination, ensuring the transfer of genetic material between orchid flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role in the specialized reproductive strategies of orchids."
