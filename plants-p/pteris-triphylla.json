    "intro": "Pteris triphylla, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Pteris triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
