    "intro": "Poa gerardii, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Poa gerardii has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixes for lawns and sports fields."
