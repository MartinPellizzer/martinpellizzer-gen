It is characterized by its graceful, arching culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Phyllostachys filifera is also valued for its ability to form dense clumps, making it an effective privacy screen or erosion control plant."
