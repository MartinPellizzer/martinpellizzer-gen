It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
