    "intro": "Pteris stelleri, commonly known as Steller's water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Pteris stelleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
