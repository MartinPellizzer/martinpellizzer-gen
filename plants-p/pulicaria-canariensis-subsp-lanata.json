    "intro": "Pulicaria canariensis subsp. lanata, commonly known as the Canary woolly groundsel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing habit with silvery-gray, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its hairy leaves and compact form make it a unique and ornamental addition to rock gardens and arid landscapes."
