    "intro": "Pilosella auriculina subsp. firmisetiformis, commonly known as the slender cat's ear, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, spreading growth habit and the presence of firm, setose (bristly) hairs on its stems and leaves. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This plant is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
