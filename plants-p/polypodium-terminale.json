    "intro": "Polypodium terminale, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky cliffs and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to colonize rocky substrates."
