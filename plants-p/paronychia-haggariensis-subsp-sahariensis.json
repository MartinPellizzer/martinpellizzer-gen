    "intro": "Paronychia haggariensis subsp. sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
