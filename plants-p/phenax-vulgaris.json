    "intro": "Phenax vulgaris, commonly known as the common fen orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale green. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in areas with high moisture levels. Phenax vulgaris plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
