    "intro": "Phreatia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. Phreatia crassifolia is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
