    "intro": "Phegopteris hastifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often lobed fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
