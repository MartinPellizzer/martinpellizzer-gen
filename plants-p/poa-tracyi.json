    "intro": "Poa tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa tracyi is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
