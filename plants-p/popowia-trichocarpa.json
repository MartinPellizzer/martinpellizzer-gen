    "intro": "Popowia trichocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and dark reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Due to its high commercial value, Popowia trichocarpa is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
