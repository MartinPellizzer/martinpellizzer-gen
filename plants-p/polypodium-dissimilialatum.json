    "intro": "Polypodium dissimilialatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
