    "intro": "Plowmanianthus grandifolius subsp. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf plowmanianthus, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
