It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the branches. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering."
