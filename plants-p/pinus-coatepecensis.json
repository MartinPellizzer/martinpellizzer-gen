    "intro": "Pinus coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Veracruz, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, with a woody structure that protects the seeds. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
