    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. discretum, commonly known as the discreet fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
