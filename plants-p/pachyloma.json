    "intro": "Pachyloma, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which store water to help them survive in arid environments. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pachyloma species are native to regions of Africa and the Middle East, where they thrive in dry, rocky soils. They are also known for producing a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested."
