    "intro": "Palicourea bryophila, commonly known as the velvetleaf palicourea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Palicourea bryophila is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
