    "intro": "Polymnia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate and often have a hairy texture. They produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Polymnia species are often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
