    "intro": "Phlegmariurus dalhousieanus, commonly known as the Dalhousie clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged spirally around its stems. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. This species is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
