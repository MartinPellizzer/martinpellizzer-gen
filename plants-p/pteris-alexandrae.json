    "intro": "Pteris alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across moist soil. Pteris alexandrae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
