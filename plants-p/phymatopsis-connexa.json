    "intro": "Phymatopsis connexa, commonly known as the Texas knawels, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, and it is often found in sandy or clay soils. Phymatopsis connexa is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
