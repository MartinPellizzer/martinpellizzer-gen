It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. It has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its humid, subtropical habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
