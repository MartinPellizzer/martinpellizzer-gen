    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces cylindrical, woody stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is closely related to other Potentilla species and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
