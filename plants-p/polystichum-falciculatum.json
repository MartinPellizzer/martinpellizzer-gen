    "intro": "Polystichum falciculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum falciculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
