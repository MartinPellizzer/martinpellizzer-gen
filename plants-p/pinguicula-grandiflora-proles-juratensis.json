    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora proles juratensis, commonly known as the Juratense butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the humid, shaded environments of Central America. It possesses specialized leaves that function as traps, secreting a sticky substance to capture small insects. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent humidity to maintain its health. Its botanical features make it a unique example of adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
