    "intro": "Polystichum guajaibonense, commonly known as the Guajaibon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum guajaibonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
