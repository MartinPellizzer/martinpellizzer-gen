    "intro": "Phalaenopsis medogensis, commonly known as the Medog orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is a type of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale pink blooms with a pleasant fragrance, and its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
