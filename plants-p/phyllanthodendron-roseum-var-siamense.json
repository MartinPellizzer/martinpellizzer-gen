    "intro": "Phyllanthodendron roseum var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive yellowish-orange fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
