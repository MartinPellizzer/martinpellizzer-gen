    "intro": "Paspalum pygmaeum var. genuinum, commonly known as the dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, forming dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
