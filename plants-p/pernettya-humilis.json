    "intro": "Pernettya humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and pine forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
