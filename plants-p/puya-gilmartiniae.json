    "intro": "Puya gilmartiniae, commonly known as the Gilmartin's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette formation, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Puya gilmartiniae is notable for its longevity, often living for several decades before flowering and dying."
