    "intro": "Peristylus candidus var. major, commonly known as the white-flowered peristylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation programs."
