It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a poultice for wounds and skin irritations."
