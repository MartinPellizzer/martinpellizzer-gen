    "intro": "Poa secunda var. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its coarse, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are usually wider than those of the typical Poa secunda, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
