    "intro": "Pteris warburgii, commonly known as the Japanese brake fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a fan. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds. Pteris warburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
