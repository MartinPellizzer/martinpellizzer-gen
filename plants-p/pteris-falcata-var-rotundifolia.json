    "intro": "Pteris falcata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctly rounded fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The fronds are pinnately divided with a smooth, waxy surface and a unique, almost fan-like shape. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
