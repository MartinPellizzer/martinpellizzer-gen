It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, and its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Potentilla macrorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
