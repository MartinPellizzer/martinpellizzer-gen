    "intro": "Pedilanthus ramosissimus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its branched stems and striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
