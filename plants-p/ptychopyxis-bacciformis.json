    "intro": "Ptychopyxis bacciformis, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy, and its clusters of small, red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural wild environment."
