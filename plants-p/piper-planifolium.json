    "intro": "Piper planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved pepper or Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its peppery taste when the leaves are crushed. Piper planifolium is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
