    "intro": "Petunia ericifolia, commonly known as the sand petunia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Petunia ericifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
