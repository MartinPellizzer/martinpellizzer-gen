    "intro": "Potentilla pendula, commonly known as the weeping cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its cascading growth habit, with slender stems that dangle gracefully from the plant. The leaves are typically compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in a fine layer of soft, silvery hair. Small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, adding a bright touch to the landscape. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
