    "intro": "Pilea pubescens var. rupicola, commonly known as the stone plant or rock plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
