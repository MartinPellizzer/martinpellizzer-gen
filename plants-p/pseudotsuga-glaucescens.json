    "intro": "Pseudotsuga glaucescens, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors. The white fir is often found in moist, cool climates and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
