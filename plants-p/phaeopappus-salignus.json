    "intro": "Phaeopappus salignus, commonly known as the silverleaf phaeopappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Phaeopappus salignus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
