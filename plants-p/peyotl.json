    "intro": "Peyotl, commonly known as the sacred hallucinogenic cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, which has been used for centuries by Native American tribes in spiritual and ceremonial contexts. The plant typically grows in arid environments, forming dense clusters of pale green stems. Peyotl is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its use in traditional practices highlights its cultural and botanical significance in indigenous communities."
