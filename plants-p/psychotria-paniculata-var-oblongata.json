    "intro": "Psychotria paniculata var. oblongata, commonly known as the purple ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pale purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
