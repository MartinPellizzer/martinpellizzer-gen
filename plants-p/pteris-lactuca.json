    "intro": "Pteris lactuca, commonly known as the milk fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Pteris lactuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
