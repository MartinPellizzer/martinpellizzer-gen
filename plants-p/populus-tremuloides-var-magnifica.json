    "intro": "Populus tremuloides var. magnifica, commonly known as the quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, trembling leaves that flutter in the slightest breeze, giving it its common name. The tree has a smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in mountainous regions, where it plays a key role in forest ecosystems. This species is also known for its ability to form extensive clonal colonies through root sprouting."
