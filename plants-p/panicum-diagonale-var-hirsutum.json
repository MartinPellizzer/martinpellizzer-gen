    "intro": "Panicum diagonale var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy foliage and spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the dense pubescence. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
