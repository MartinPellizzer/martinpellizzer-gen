It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble a serpent's body. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
