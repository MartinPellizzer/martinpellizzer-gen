    "intro": "Pleonotoma chondrogona, commonly known as the chondrogone flatback tortoise, is a species of land snail belonging to the family Helicarionidae. It is characterized by its small, robust shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The species is native to parts of southern Africa, where it inhabits moist, forested environments. Its diet primarily consists of decaying plant matter and fungi, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, it is considered a vulnerable species."
