    "intro": "Psychotria oblongifolia, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"cup of joy,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its psychoactive properties. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
