    "intro": "Primula plantae, commonly known as the primrose, is a genus of about 500 species of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, pink, and purple. Primulas are often found in temperate regions and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are popular in gardens for their early spring blooms and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being cultivated for ornamental purposes."
