    "intro": "Polemonium shastense f. pilosum, commonly known as the Shasta monkshood, is a unique variant of the Shasta monkshood, characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. This plant is native to the Pacific Northwest and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy, hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. The flowers, which are typically blue to purple, are arranged in spikes and feature a hooded shape typical of the genus Polemonium. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
