    "intro": "Primula stephanocalyx, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive purple or reddish stripe along the throat. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula stephanocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
