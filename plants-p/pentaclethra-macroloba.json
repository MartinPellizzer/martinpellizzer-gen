    "intro": "Pentaclethra macroloba, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its dense, dark wood is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments, though overharvesting has led to conservation concerns."
