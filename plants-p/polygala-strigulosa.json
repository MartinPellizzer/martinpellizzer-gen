It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
