    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera f. ovalidrupacea, commonly known as the oval leaf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are broader and more oval than those of the typical Prunus cerasifera. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its unique leaf shape and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture."
