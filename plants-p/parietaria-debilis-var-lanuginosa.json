    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy wall lettuce, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to damp, nutrient-poor soils."
