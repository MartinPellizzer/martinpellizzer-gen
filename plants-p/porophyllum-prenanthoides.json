    "intro": "Porophyllum prenanthoides, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
