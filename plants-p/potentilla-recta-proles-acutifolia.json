    "intro": "Potentilla recta proles acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, pointed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
