    "intro": "Pellaea longimucronata var. minor, commonly known as the small-tipped rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
