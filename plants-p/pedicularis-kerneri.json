It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in rocky or meadow habitats. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical studies."
