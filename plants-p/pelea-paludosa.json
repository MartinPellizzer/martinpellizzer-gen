    "intro": "Pelea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pelea, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Pelea paludosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
