    "intro": "Primula nivalis subsp. xanthobasis, commonly known as the yellow-leaved alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its distinctive yellowish-green leaves, which are broader and more robust than those of the typical species. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and a hairy calyx. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in rocky or mountainous habitats. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
