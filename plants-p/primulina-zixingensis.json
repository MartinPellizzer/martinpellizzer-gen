It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
