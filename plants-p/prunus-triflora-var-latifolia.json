    "intro": "Prunus triflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible drupes that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
