    "intro": "Pellaea calidirupium, commonly known as the warm rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on rock surfaces. The botanical features of Pellaea calidirupium make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
