    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pilosella polymnonia, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are yellow with white ray florets, resembling a dandelion, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Pilosella polymnonia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
