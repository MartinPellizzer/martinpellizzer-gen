    "intro": "Pyrus ogisui, commonly known as the Ogasawara pear, is a species of flowering plant native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island habitat."
