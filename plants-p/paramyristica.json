    "intro": "Paramyristica, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and aiding in gas exchange. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Paramyristica plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
