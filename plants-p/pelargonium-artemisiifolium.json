    "intro": "Pelargonium artemisiifolium, commonly known as the Artemisia-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the Artemisia genus, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. Pelargonium artemisiifolium prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders and containers."
