    "intro": "Pieris japonica f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese pieris, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white bell-shaped flowers in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for foundation plantings or as a specimen plant."
