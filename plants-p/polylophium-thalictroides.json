    "intro": "Polylophium thalictroides, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
