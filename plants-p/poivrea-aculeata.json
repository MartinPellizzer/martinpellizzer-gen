    "intro": "Poivrea aculeata, commonly known as the prickly ash or white bark. It is a deciduous shrub native to North America, characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark is smooth and white, with a distinctive scent, and it thrives in well-drained soils in woodland areas. Poivrea aculeata is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
