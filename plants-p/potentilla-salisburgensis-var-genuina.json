    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. genuina, commonly known as Salzburg cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically features wiry stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually oval to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and mountain slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and colorful display."
