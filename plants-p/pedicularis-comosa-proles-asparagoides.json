It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant features hairy, glandular stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
