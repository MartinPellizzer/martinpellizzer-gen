    "intro": "Pseudogoodyera pseudogoodyeroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pseudogoodyera, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
