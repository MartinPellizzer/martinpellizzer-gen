    "intro": "Pleopeltis macrosphaera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators."
