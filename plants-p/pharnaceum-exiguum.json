    "intro": "Pharnaceum exiguum, commonly known as the small pharnaceum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pharnaceum exiguum is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
