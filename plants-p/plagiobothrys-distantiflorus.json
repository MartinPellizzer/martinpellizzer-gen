    "intro": "Plagiobothrys distantiflorus, commonly known as the distant-flowered plagiobothrys, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
