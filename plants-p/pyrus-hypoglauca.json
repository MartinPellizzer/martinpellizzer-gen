    "intro": "Pyrus hypoglauca, commonly known as the white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow or orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically small, with a thin, juicy pulp and a sweet, aromatic flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
