    "intro": "Parkinsonia microphylla, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and bipinnately compound leaves that are small and feathery. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
