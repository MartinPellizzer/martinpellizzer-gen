It features compact, upright growth with hairy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
