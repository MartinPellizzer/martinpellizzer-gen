    "intro": "Poa nana, commonly known as alpine moss grass, is a low-growing grass species native to cold and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats close to the ground, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in moisture retention. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa nana is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various small animals and insects."
