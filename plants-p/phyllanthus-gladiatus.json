    "intro": "Phyllanthus gladiatus, commonly known as the swordleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
