    "intro": "Primulina lijiangensis, commonly known as the Liangjiang primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yunnan province of China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually ovate with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
