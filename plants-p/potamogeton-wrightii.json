It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by narrow, boat-shaped fruits. Wright's pondweed plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
