    "intro": "Pilosella macrostolona subsp. piscinae, commonly known as the Italian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
