    "intro": "Potentilla callida, commonly known as the showy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Potentilla callida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
