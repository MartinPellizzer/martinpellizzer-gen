    "intro": "Polygonum sagittatum var. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian knotweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features upright stems that are often reddish or purple-hued, and its leaves are arrow-shaped with a distinctively notched base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
