    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. turfosa, commonly known as the Scottish pine or mountain pine, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The leaves are typically shorter and more twisted compared to the standard Scots pine, adapting to cold and windy conditions. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for years. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in mountainous regions."
