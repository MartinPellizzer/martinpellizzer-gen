    "intro": "Pseudananas macrodontes, commonly known as the giant pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, capable of holding water. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
