    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact form of the Scots pine characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles. It is native to northern Europe and thrives in cold, temperate climates. The plant has a slow growth rate, which contributes to its compact and bushy appearance. Its foliage is often a dark green, and it produces cones that are typically smaller than those of the typical Scots pine. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
