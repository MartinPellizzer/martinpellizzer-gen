    "intro": "Polypodium selligueoides, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
