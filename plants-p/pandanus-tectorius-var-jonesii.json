    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. jonesii, commonly known as the pandanus sedge or hibiscus pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, coastal environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience to salt spray."
