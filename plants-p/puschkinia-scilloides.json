    "intro": "Puschkinia scilloides, commonly known as the Turk's\u5e3d tulip, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Puschkinia scilloides is also valued for its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
