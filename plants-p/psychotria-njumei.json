It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by bright red bracts. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds.
