    "intro": "Portuna, commonly known as the Portuna tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its bark contains compounds with potential anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, the Portuna tree is now considered a rare and endangered species."
