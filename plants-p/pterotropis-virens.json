    "intro": "Pterotropis virens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lanceolate leaves that are usually bright green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pterotropis virens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
