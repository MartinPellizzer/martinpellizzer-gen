    "intro": "Phoradendron serotinum subsp. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
