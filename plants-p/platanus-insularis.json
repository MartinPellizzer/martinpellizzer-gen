    "intro": "Platanus insularis, commonly known as the island sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fuzzy, white underside. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, flaky, and greyish, providing a distinctive appearance. Platanus insularis is adapted to coastal and urban environments, making it a common ornamental tree in southern Europe."
