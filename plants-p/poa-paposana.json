    "intro": "Poa paposana, commonly known as the Puposana grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa paposana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
