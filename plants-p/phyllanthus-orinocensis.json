    "intro": "Phyllanthus orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. It produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by water or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
