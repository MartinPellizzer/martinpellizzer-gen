It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces aromatic, glandular leaves that are often described as having a minty or camphor-like scent. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Pycnanthemum decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
