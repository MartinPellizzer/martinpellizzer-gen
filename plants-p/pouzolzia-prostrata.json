    "intro": "Pouzolzia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pouzolzia, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling, mat-forming growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to survive in poor soil conditions. Pouzolzia prostrata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
