    "intro": "Platostoma elongatum, commonly known as the elongated shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender rhizome and its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds. Platostoma elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
