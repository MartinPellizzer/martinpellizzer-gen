    "intro": "Phacelia ramosissima f. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, often prostrate stems that lie close to the ground, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
