    "intro": "Pancratium foetidum var. rifanum, commonly known as the stink lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and a strong, often unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is in bloom. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It produces a bulbous stem and has narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
