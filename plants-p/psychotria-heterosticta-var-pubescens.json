    "intro": "Psychotria heterosticta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its morphological features and ecological niche, it plays a role in local biodiversity and may have traditional uses in certain indigenous communities."
