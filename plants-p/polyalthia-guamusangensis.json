    "intro": "Polyalthia guamusangensis, commonly known as the Malayan tree or Guamusang tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
