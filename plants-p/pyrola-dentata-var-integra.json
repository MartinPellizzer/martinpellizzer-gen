    "intro": "Pyrola dentata var. integra, commonly known as the white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features a dense rosette of oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Pyrola dentata var. integra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
