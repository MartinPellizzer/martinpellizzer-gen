    "intro": "Pilea trinervia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea trinervia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
