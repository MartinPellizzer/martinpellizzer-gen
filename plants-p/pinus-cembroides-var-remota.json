    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. remota, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert pine, is a variant of the Mexican pine that is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the tree for many years. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
