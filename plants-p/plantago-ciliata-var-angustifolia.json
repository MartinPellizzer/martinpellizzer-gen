It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in urban environments. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
