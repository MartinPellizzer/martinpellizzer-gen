    "intro": "Persicaria nodosa, commonly known as nodding smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various wetland habitats."
