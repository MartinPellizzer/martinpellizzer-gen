It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that resemble cucumbers, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. The tree thrives in humid conditions and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
