    "intro": "Paspalum ambustum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and is adapted to moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers that are usually pale green to purple in color. Paspalum ambustum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
