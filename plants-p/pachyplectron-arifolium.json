    "intro": "Pachyplectron arifolium, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Pachyplectron arifolium is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
