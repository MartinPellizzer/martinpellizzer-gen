    "intro": "Peucedanum fraxinifolium var. petiolulatum, commonly known as the petioled cow parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and have short petioles, distinguishing it from other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
