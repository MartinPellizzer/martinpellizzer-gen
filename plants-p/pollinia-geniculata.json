    "intro": "Pollinia geniculata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate pollination by attaching to the bodies of pollinators. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pollinia geniculata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
