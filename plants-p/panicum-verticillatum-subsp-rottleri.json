    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum subsp. rottleri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear spikelets with bristly hairs, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
