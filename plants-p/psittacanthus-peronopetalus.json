It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble stars, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
