    "intro": "Polycarpon repens, commonly known as creeping nightshade, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Polycarpon repens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions."
