It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for container gardening and as a houseplant."
