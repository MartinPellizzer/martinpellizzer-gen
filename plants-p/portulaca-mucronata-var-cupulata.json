    "intro": "Portulaca mucronata var. cupulata, commonly known as the hooded portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant's leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions."
