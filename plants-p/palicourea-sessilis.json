    "intro": "Palicourea sessilis, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
