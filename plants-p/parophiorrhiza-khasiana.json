    "intro": "Parophiorrhiza khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
