    "intro": "Pandanus rapensis, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts. Its fibrous leaves are also utilized for thatching and weaving. Pandanus rapensis thrives in coastal and wetland environments, adapting well to saline and humid conditions."
