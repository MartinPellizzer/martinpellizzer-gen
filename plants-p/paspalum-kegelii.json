The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures. Paspalum kegelii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
