It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spreading growth habit. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
