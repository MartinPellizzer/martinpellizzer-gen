    "intro": "Pandanus julifer, commonly known as the Christmas palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit clusters that are often used in traditional crafts. Its adaptability to coastal and saline environments makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical landscapes."
