    "intro": "Petasites officinalis subsp. foemina, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and forested areas. It has a tuberous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. The subspecies foemina is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the main species."
