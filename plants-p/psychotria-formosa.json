    "intro": "Psychotria formosa, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpets\" or \"blue angel,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is typically an evergreen shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Psychotria formosa is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its significance in traditional and modern ethnobotanical contexts."
