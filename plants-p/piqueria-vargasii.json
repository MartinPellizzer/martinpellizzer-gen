    "intro": "Piqueria vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas's piqueria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Piqueria vargasii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
