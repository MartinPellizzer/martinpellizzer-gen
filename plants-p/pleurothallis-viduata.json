    "intro": "Pleurothallis viduata, commonly known as the widow's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
