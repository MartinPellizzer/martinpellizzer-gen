    "intro": "Phaeostoma xantiana, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungus with a distinctive appearance and odor. It produces a yellow, fleshy, egg-shaped fruiting body that emits a strong, unpleasant smell to attract insects for spore dispersal. The fungus is typically found in decaying wood or leaf litter in moist, shaded environments. Its life cycle involves the development of a stem and a cap, with the cap eventually splitting to release spores. Phaeostoma xantiana is a member of the Phallaceae family, known for its unusual and often foul-smelling species."
