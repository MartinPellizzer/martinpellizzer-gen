    "intro": "Platanus racemosa subsp. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rough, mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are heart-shaped with a pointed tip and are typically 5\u201310 inches long. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in such climates."
