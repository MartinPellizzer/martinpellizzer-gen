    "intro": "Ponerorchis lepida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are typically small and clustered at the base, and it lacks true roots, relying on specialized structures called rhizoids for attachment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis lepida is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes."
