    "intro": "Paspalum planifolium, commonly known as flat-leaf paspalum, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum planifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
