    "intro": "Parthenium arctium, commonly known as common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring erect, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, burr-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas. Parthenium arctium is considered a weed in many regions but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
