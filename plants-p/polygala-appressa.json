    "intro": "Polygala appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milk-vetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has alternate, narrow leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
