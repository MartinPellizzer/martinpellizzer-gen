    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. minima, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are also covered in a similar fuzzy texture. This subvariety is well adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a hardy component of alpine flora."
