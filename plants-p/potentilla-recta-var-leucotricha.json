    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in dense white or pale yellow hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are compound, with five leaflets that are oval to lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
