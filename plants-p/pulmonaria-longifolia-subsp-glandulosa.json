    "intro": "Pulmonaria longifolia subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves with distinctive glandular dots along the midribs. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers from late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental foliage and early flowering."
