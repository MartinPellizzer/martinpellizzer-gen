    "intro": "Parathelypteris grammitoides, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
