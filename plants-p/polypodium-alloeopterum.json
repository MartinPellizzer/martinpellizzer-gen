    "intro": "Polypodium alloeopterum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium alloeopterum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
