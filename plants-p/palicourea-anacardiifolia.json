    "intro": "Palicourea anacardiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
