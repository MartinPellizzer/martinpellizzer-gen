    "intro": "Pedicularis breviscaposa, commonly known as the short-capped lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, bilaterally symmetric flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
