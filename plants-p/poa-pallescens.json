    "intro": "Poa pallescens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa pallescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
