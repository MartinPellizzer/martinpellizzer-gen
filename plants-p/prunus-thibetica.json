    "intro": "Prunus thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of China, India, and Nepal. It typically grows at high altitudes, reaching elevations up to 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Prunus thibetica is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
