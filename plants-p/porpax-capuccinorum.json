    "intro": "Porpax capuccinorum, commonly known as the Capuchin orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often resemble the headgear of a Capuchin monk, giving it its common name. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it attaches itself to trees or other plants as an epiphyte. The flowers are usually fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Porpax capuccinorum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
