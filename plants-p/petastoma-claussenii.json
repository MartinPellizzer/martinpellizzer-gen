    "intro": "Petastoma claussenii, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colorado and New Mexico. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, elongated seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
