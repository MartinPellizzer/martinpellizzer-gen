    "intro": "Panicum royleanum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control in dry environments."
