It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
