    "intro": "Psilactis brevilingulata f. andina, commonly known as the Andean psilactis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which contains the spores necessary for its propagation. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
