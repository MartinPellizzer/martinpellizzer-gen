    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. specuicola, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
