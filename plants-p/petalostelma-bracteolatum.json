It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
