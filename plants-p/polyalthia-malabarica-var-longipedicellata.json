    "intro": "Polyalthia malabarica var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the Malabar satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
