    "intro": "Potentilla lacerna-femina, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its common name is derived from the resemblance of its leaves to a medieval lady's mantle."
