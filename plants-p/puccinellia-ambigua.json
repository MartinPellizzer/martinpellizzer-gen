    "intro": "Puccinellia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed flowers. Puccinellia ambigua is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
