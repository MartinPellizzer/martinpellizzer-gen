    "intro": "Prunus lanata, commonly known as the woolly cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray or white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, round drupes that are typically red or black when ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
