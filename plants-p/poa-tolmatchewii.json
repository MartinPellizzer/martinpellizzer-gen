    "intro": "Poa tolmatchewii, commonly known as the Tolmatchewii bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
