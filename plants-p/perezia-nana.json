    "intro": "Perezia nana, commonly known as the dwarf perezia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
