    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. convallariifolia, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, and white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a slender, erect stem and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
