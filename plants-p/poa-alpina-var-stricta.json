    "intro": "Poa alpina var. stricta, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its slender, stiff blades and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant typically forms dense mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. It produces small, pale green or blue-green flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous system allows it to spread and colonize new areas. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine environments."
