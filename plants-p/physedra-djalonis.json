It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it a wheel-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Physedra djalonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity levels."
