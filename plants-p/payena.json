    "intro": "Payena, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. These plants are characterized by their dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Payena species typically have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellow in color. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
