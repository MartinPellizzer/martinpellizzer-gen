    "intro": "Poa naratavica, commonly known as the Naratava grass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Poa naratavica is often found in association with other native grasses and is an important component of New Zealand's alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
