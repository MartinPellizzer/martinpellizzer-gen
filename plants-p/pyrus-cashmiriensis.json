    "intro": "Pyrus cashmiriensis, commonly known as the Kashmir pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas, specifically found in regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by pear-shaped fruits that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The fruit has a crisp, juicy texture with a sweet and slightly tart flavor, making it a valued crop in local cuisines. It is also cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
