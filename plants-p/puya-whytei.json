    "intro": "Puya whytei, commonly known as the White's puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences with vibrant purple and white flowers, which bloom in the early morning. Puya whytei is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, sunny conditions with well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized gardens."
