    "intro": "Pinus dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically grouped in bundles of five, and its distinctive cone structure. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being woody and often remaining on the tree for several years. Pinus dahurica is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in various traditional and commercial applications."
