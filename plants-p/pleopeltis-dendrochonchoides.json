    "intro": "Pleopeltis dendrochonchoides, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds producing spores on the underside. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, tropical climates."
