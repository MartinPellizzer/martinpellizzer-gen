    "intro": "Panicum daltonii, commonly known as Dalton's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
