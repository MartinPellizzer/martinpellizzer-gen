It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and cones that are typically shorter than those of the typical white spruce. The leaves are usually shorter and more densely packed, giving the tree a distinct appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
