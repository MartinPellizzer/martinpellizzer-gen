    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus platyacanthus, commonly known as the flat-spined cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
