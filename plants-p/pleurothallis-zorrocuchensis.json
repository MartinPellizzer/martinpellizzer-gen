    "intro": "Pleurothallis zorrocuchensis, commonly known as the Zorrocuch\u00e9 orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
