    "intro": "Potentilla pimpinelloides, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
