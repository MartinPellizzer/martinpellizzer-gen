    "intro": "Potentilla sibirica f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
