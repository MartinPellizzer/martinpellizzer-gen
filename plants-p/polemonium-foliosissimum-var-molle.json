    "intro": "Polemonium foliosissimum var. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved white fringed gentian, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of showy, white to pale blue flowers with prominent, fringed petals. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, which distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
