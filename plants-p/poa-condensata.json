    "intro": "Poa condensata, commonly known as the dense meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per branch. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green coloration, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. Poa condensata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
