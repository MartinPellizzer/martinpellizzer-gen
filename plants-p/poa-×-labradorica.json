    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 labradorica, commonly known as Labrador bluegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a cool-season grass that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that are resistant to foot traffic. Its low maintenance requirements and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions contribute to its widespread use in turfgrass and restoration projects."
