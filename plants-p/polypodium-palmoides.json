    "intro": "Polypodium palmoides, commonly known as the false fern or palm fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that resemble a closed hand. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a short, thick stem and multiple fiddlehead-like spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Polypodium palmoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
