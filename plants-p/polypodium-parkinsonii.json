    "intro": "Polypodium parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. The botanical features of Polypodium parkinsonii make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
