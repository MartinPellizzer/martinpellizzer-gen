    "intro": "Polypodium sublucidum, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a small, kidney-shaped structure called an indusium. Polypodium sublucidum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings with proper care."
