It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually pink or purple in color.

They play a role in both ecological systems and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
