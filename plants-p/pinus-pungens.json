    "intro": "Pinus pungens, commonly known as the eastern white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against wildfires. Pinus pungens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas."
