    "intro": "Pyrus thayensis, commonly known as the Thayen pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with compound leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. The species is of interest to botanists due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to high-altitude environments."
