    "intro": "Pelexia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several U.S. states."
