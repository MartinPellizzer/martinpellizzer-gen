    "intro": "Pinus quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-needle pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of four, giving it its common name. The plant produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds necessary for reproduction. Its needles are typically light green and remain on the tree for several years before shedding. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
