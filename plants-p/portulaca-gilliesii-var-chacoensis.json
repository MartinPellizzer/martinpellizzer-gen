    "intro": "Portulaca gilliesii var. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the day and close at night. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Its botanical features make it a resilient species often found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
