    "intro": "Pisum sativum convar. axiphium, commonly known as the wild pea, is a botanical variant of the pea species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods containing 2\u20135 seeds, which are typically smaller and more angular compared to those of cultivated peas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with cultivated peas."
