    "intro": "Pogostemon esquirolii var. tsingpingensis, commonly known as the Tsingping pogostemon, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
