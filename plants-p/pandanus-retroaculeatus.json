    "intro": "Pandanus retroaculeatus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the top of the plant. Its roots are fibrous and can grow quite deep, helping it to anchor in sandy or coastal soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions."
