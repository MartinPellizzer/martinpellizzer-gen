    "intro": "Pilostyles covillei, commonly known as the Coville's ghost flower, is a rare and unique parasitic plant found primarily in the southwestern United States. It lacks typical green foliage and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often mistaken for those of its host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as certain species of cacti and grasses. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Pilostyles covillei is considered an endangered species."
