    "intro": "Plantago major var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This variety is often found in lawns, disturbed soils, and along paths, where it serves as a common weed."
