    "intro": "Pinus mitis var. paupera, commonly known as the Sitka white pine, is a variant of the Sitka pine native to the coastal regions of southeastern Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit and long, soft needles that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in length. The tree produces cones that are smaller than those of the typical Sitka pine, and its bark is thin and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age. This variety is adapted to moist, coastal environments and is often found in association with other coniferous species in its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
