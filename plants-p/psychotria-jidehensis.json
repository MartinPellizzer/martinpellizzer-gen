    "intro": "Psychotria jidehensis, commonly known as the Jidehense Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many tropical plants known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
