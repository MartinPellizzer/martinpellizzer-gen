    "intro": "Phyllonoma integerrima, commonly known as the roughleaf phyllonoma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough or hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in shrublands and open woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
