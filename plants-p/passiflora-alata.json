It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are popular in tropical cuisines. Its stems are armed with sharp spines, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. Passiflora alata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display and unique foliage."
