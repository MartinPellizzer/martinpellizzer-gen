    "intro": "Pseudopanax simplex, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves that resemble a fern, with a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant is known for its slow growth and can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries."
