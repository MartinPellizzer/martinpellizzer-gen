    "intro": "Peperomia angulata, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by tiny, round berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia angulata is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to add a touch of greenery to any space."
