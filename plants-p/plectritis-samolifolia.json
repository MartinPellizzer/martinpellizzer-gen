    "intro": "Plectritis samolifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf plectritis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
