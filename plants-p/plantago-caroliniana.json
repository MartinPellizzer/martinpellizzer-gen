    "intro": "Plantago caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina plantain, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, oval, and hairy leaves that are typically light green to grayish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
