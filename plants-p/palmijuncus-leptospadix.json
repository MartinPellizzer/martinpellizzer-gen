It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and a single, elongated spadix that bears small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Due to its distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
