    "intro": "Pilocereus strictus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Pilocereus strictus is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and spines that provide protection."
