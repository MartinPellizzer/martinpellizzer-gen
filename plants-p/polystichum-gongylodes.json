    "intro": "Polystichum gongylodes, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum gongylodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its lush, decorative foliage."
