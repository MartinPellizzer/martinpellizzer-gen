    "intro": "Petasites dubius, commonly known as the giant cowbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Petasites dubius is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas where the soil remains cool and damp."
