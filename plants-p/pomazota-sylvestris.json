    "intro": "Pomazota sylvestris, commonly known as the wild pomegranate, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Punicaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are similar in appearance to pomegranates but are typically smaller and less commonly consumed by humans. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters, while its leaves are oval and have a leathery texture. Pomazota sylvestris is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
