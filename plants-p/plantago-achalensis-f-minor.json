    "intro": "Plantago achalensis f. minor, commonly known as the lesser Achalensis plantain, is a variant of the broader Plantago achalensis species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Pakistan, particularly in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
