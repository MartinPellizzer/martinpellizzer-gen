    "intro": "Paepalanthus eriophaeus, commonly known as the woolly pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
