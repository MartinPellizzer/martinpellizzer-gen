    "intro": "Padus racemosa subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock elderberry, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in rocky and mountainous regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and composed of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
