    "intro": "Pedicularis socalskii, commonly known as the Socalskii lousewort, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Its flowers are usually red or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
