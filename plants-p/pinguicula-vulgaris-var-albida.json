    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. albida, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are typically pale green to white, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or damp meadows."
