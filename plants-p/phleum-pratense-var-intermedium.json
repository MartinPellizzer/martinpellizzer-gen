    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in forage agriculture."
