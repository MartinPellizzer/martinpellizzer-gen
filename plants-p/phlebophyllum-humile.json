    "intro": "Phlebophyllum humile, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Phlebophyllum humile plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
