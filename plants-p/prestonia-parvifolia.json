    "intro": "Prestonia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
