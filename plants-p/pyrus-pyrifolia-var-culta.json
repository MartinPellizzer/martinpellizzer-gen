    "intro": "Pyrus pyrifolia var. culta, commonly known as the Japanese apple or Chinese white pear, is a cultivar of the pear tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, white or pale yellow fruits with a crisp, juicy texture and a sweet, sometimes tart flavor. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and the tree is relatively disease-resistant compared to other pear species."
