    "intro": "Pentacalia phanerandra, commonly known as the showy pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily appreciated for its natural habitat and ecological role."
