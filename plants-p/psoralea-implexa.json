    "intro": "Psoralea implexa, commonly known as the clustered psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Psoralea implexa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
