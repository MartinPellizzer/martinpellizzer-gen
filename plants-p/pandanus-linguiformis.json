It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a fibrous, woody stem. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators."
