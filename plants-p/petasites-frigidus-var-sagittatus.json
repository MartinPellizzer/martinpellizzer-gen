    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. sagittatus, commonly known as the arrowhead buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, greenish fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it plays an important role in high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
