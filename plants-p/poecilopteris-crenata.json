    "intro": "Poecilopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant thrived during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, particularly in warm, humid climates. Its structure suggests it was a robust, woody fern that likely grew in dense, tropical forests. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in ancient ecosystems, contributing to the development of early soil and vegetation."
