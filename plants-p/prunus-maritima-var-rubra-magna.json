    "intro": "Prunus maritima var. rubra-magna, commonly known as the red magnolia, is a variant of the coastal dogwood native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along the edges of swamps and tidal marshes. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and often have a slight waxy coating. The fruit is a small, blue-black drupe that ripens in the fall and is an important food source for birds and small mammals."
