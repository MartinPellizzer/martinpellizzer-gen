It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid, shaded environments.
