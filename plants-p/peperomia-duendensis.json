The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are often crinkled or wavy, adding a unique textural element to its appearance. Peperomia duendensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements."
