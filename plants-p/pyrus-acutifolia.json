    "intro": "Pyrus acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, acuminate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Pyrus acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
