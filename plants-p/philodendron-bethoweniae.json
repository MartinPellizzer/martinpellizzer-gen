    "intro": "Philodendron bethoweniae, commonly known as the Bethowenia philodendron, is a rare and unique member of the Araceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 50 centimeters in length. It produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in cultivation."
