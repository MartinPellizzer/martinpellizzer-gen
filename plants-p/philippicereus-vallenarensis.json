It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
