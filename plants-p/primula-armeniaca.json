    "intro": "Primula armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of oval, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered a rare species in some regions."
