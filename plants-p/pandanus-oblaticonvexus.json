    "intro": "Pandanus oblaticonvexus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments. Its inflorescences are complex and contain both male and female flowers, which are pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that matures into a reddish color, often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
