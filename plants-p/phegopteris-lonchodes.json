    "intro": "Phegopteris lonchodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health."
