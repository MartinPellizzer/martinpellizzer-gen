    "intro": "Phlomis stricta, commonly known as upright mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. Phlomis stricta is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
