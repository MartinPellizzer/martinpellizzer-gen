    "intro": "Potentilla bryoides, commonly known as mossy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a moss-like appearance. Potentilla bryoides thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
