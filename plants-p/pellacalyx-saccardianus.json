    "intro": "Pellacalyx saccardianus, commonly known as the Saccardian calyx plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, elongated calyx that resembles a sac, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
