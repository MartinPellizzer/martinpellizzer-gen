    "intro": "Prasophyllum macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stemmed leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a dense spike of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
