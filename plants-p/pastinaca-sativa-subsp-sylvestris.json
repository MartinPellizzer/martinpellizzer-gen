    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, ridged taproot that is typically yellowish-white in color and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels during the summer months. Wild parsnip is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and woodland edges."
