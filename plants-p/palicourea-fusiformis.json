It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Palicourea fusiformis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
