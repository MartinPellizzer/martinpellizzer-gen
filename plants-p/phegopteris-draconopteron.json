    "intro": "Phegopteris draconopteron, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the tail of a dragon, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The plant's spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
