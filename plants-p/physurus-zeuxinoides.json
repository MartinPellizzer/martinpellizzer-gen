    "intro": "Physurus zeuxinoides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
