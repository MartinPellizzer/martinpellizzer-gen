    "intro": "Pigea cymulosa, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, which bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are upright and often bear multiple flower clusters, enhancing its ornamental value. Pigea cymulosa is valued in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal in rocky or alpine garden settings."
