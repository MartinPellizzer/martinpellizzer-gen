    "intro": "Pedicularis bonjeanii, commonly known as the Bonjean's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its hairy, glandular stems. It grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations where it relies on specific host plants for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
