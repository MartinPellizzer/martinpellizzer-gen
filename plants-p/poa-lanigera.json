    "intro": "Poa lanigera, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as along stream banks and in forest margins. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-rowed spikelets. Poa lanigera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
