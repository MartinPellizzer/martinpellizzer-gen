    "intro": "Pycreus cleaveri, commonly known as the cleaver orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help in reducing water loss. Pycreus cleaveri is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and damp meadows."
