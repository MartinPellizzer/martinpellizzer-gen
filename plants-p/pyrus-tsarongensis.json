    "intro": "Pyrus tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong apple, is a rare species of apple native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant thrives in cold climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a rough texture, and it produces white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botany."
