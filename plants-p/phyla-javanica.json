    "intro": "Phyla javanica, commonly known as the Javanese fern, is a species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, which allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Phyla javanica is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
