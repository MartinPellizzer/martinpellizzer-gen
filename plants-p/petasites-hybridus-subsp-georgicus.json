    "intro": "Petasites hybridus subsp. georgicus, commonly known as the Georgian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, and its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other notable species such as the buttercup and celandine. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
