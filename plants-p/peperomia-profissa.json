It features glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are typically borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia profissa is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
