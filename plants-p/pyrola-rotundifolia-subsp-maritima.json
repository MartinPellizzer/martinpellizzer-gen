    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal pyrola, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the northern Atlantic. It is characterized by its small, round leaves and showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils along rocky shores and dunes. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed coastal ecosystems."
