    "intro": "Prasophyllum macrotys, commonly known as the large-leafed leek orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often resembling those of the leek plant, hence its common name. Prasophyllum macrotys is a rare and protected species, found in specific habitats across New South Wales and Victoria."
