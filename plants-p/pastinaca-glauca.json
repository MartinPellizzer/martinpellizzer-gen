    "intro": "Pastinaca glauca, commonly known as the blue burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Pastinaca glauca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various regions outside its native range."
