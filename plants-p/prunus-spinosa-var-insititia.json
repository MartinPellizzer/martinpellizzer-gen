    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. insititia, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the berries. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. The berries are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic in its raw form."
