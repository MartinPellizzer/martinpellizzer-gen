    "intro": "Pelargonium viciifolium, commonly known as the cow parsley geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and compound leaves that resemble those of vicia, a type of vetch. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is often cultivated in gardens."
