    "intro": "Phoenix reclinata, commonly known as the reclining date palm, is a species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a small, slow-growing palm that typically reaches a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and has long, narrow, fan-shaped leaves. Its fruit, which is a small date, is edible but not as commonly consumed as that of other date palms. The reclining date palm is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
