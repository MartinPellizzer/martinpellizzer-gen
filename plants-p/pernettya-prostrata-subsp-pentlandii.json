    "intro": "Pernettya prostrata subsp. pentlandii, commonly known as the Scottish cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, urn-shaped white flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
