    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a variant of the common reed that is characterized by its hairy stems and dense growth habit. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
