    "intro": "Pyrenacantha occidentalis, commonly known as the western pyrenacantha, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
