It is characterized by its striking, palm-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and over-collection."
