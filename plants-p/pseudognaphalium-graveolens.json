    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium graveolens, commonly known as yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces bright yellow ray flowers that are arranged in a flat, daisy-like structure, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and pleasant fragrance. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
