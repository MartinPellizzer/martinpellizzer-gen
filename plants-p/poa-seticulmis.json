    "intro": "Poa seticulmis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and dense, low-growing habit, often forming compact mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa seticulmis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
