    "intro": "Pouteria sambuensis, commonly known as the wild mango or Brazilian peach, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, smooth, green bark and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp that is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing before the leaves, and it is valued for both its edible fruit and ecological significance in its native habitat."
