    "intro": "Phoradendron iltisiorum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. The plant has a succulent, evergreen appearance with small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy berries. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
