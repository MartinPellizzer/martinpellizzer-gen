    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. gselliana, commonly known as the greenish marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
