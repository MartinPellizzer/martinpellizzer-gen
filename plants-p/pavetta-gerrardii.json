It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Pavetta gerrardii is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its botanical features make it an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits."
