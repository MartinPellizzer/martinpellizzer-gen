    "intro": "Podocarpus vieillardii, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and reddish-brown bark. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in the wild."
