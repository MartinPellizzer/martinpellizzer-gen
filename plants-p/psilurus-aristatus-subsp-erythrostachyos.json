    "intro": "Psilurus aristatus subsp. erythrostachyos, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is wiry and produces both roots and new growth. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in dense, stalked clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
