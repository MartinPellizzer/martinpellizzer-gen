    "intro": "Pteris beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
