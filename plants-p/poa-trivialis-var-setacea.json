    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
