    "intro": "Paederia foetida f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved stinkweed, is a variant of the stinkweed species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its aromatic foliage, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
