It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water.

It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments."
