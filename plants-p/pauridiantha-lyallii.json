    "intro": "Pauridiantha lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall\u2019s pauridiantha, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
