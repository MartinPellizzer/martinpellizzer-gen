    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. catharinea, commonly known as the Blackthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries known as serviceberries. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and pies. The plant is also notable for its thorny branches, which provide habitat for birds and other wildlife."
