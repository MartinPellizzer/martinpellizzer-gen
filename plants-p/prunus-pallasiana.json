It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or black berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant yellow or red in autumn. Prunus pallasiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
