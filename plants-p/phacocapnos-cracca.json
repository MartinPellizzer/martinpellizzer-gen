    "intro": "Phacocapnos cracca, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Phacocapnos cracca plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
