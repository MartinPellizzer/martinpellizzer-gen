    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. remotifolia, commonly known as the distant-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy soils in northern regions. It features wiry, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
