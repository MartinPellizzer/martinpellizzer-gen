    "intro": "Piriqueta stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf piriqueta, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important component of desert ecosystems."
