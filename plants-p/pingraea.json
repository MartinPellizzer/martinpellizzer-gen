    "intro": "Pingraea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae, which includes other species like willowherbs and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in remote and difficult-to-reach habitats. Pingraea is known for its delicate appearance and is often referred to as a \"ghost flower\" due to its fleeting and mysterious presence in the wild. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
