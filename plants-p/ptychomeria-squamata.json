The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its woody stems are often covered in a scaly or flaky texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ptychomeria squamata is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
