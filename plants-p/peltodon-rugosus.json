    "intro": "Peltodon rugosus, commonly known as the roughleaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its distinctive, rugged leaf surfaces. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The fronds are usually divided into numerous small, serrated segments, giving the plant its textured appearance. Peltodon rugosus thrives in nutrient-rich substrates and requires moderate to high water flow for optimal growth. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in the study of aquatic botany."
