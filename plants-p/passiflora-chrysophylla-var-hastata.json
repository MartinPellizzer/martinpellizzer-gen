    "intro": "Passiflora chrysophylla var. hastata, commonly known as the golden-leaf passionflower, is a rare and striking species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage and showy, intricate flowers that feature a unique blend of colors, including white, purple, and blue. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor, making it both ornamental and potentially useful in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
