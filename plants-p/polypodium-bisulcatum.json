    "intro": "Polypodium bisulcatum, commonly known as the serrated huperzia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are deeply serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
