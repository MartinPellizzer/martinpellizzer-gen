    "intro": "Pinus quadrifolia subsp. juarezensis, commonly known as the Huastec pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to a small region in eastern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, cylindrical cones and needle-like leaves. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, including its distinctive bark and seed structure, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
