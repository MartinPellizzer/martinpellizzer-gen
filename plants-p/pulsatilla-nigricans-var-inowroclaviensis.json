    "intro": "Pulsatilla nigricans var. inowroclaviensis, commonly known as the Inowroc\u0142aw pasqueflower, is a rare and endemic species native to Poland. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, early spring blooms. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
