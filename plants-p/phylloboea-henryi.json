    "intro": "Phylloboea henryi, commonly known as the Henry's phylloboea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of many members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
