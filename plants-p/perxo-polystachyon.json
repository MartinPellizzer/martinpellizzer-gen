    "intro": "Perxo polystachyon, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates and absorbing nutrients. Perxo polystachyon is also notable for its cultural significance in various Asian traditions."
