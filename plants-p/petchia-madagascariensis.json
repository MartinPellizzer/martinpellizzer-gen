It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fruits that resemble a starfruit or carambola. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically followed by the distinctive, five-lobed fruit. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
