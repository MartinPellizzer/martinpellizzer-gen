    "intro": "Prosopis ephedrioides, commonly known as the desert bean or thorn tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil stabilization. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a significant species in its native habitats."
