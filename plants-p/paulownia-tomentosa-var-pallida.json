    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa var. pallida, commonly known as the silver Paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in early spring, typically in shades of pink to purple. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for crafting and musical instruments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
