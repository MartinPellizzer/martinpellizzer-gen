    "intro": "Phaca ovigera, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of the water body while its stems and leaves remain above the surface. Phaca ovigera plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic life and can help in water filtration."
