    "intro": "Potentilla unguiculata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla unguiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in alpine gardens."
