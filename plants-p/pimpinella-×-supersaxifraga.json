    "intro": "Pimpinella \u00d7 supersaxifraga, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. It is a natural hybrid between Pimpinella saxifraga and Pimpinella polypetala, resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits from both parents. The species is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or shaded areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
