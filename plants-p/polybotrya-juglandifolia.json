    "intro": "Polybotrya juglandifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
