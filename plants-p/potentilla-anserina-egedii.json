    "intro": "Potentilla anserina egedii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
