It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and other vine plants. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, with the fruit being a round, orange-colored pumpkin-like structure. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found growing in moist, forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
