    "intro": "Pygmea thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's pygmy grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, delicate spikelets that are characteristic of the grass family. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh mountain climates. Pygmea thomsonii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
