    "intro": "Panope, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk florets, which resemble a daisy. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Panope is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
