    "intro": "Physalis barbadensis, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a tangy, sweet flavor. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is related to the tomato and potato. The fruit's unique structure, with a papery outer husk, aids in seed dispersal and protection."
