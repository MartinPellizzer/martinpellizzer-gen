    "intro": "Psychotria mindanaensis, commonly known as Mindanao Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Mindanao, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
