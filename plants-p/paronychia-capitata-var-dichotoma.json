    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. dichotoma, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often branched and rise above the foliage, bearing numerous tiny flowers. This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
