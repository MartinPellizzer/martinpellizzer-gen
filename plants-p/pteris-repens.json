    "intro": "Pteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to colonize and stabilize soil."
