    "intro": "Portulaca parvula, commonly known as the dwarf moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, arid environments. The plant features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically bright red or pink, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Portulaca parvula is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
