    "intro": "Pleopeltis insignis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pleopeltis insignis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
