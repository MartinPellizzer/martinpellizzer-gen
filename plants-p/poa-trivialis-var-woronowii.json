    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. woronowii, commonly known as the Woronowii meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
