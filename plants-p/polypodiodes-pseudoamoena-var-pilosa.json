    "intro": "Polypodiodes pseudoamoena var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy polypodiodes, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The varietal form *pilosa* is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering, which aids in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
