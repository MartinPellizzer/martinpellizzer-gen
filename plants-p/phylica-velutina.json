    "intro": "Phylica velutina, commonly known as the velvet phylica, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Phylica velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
