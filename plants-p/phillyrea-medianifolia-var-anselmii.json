    "intro": "Phillyrea medianifolia var. anselmii, commonly known as the Anselm\u2019s Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance, giving the plant a distinctive silvery-blue hue. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by small, rounded berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
