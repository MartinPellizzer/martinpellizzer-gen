    "intro": "Paullinia fissistipula, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact as an invasive species in some regions is a concern."
