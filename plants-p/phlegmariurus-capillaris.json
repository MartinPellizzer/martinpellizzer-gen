It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats on the forest floor. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporophyte produces spores in small, club-shaped structures called strobila. Phlegmariurus capillaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
