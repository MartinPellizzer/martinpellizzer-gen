    "intro": "Pleurothallis resupinata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, often found clinging to tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps it thrive in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
