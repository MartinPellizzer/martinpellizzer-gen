    "intro": "Potentilla perpusilloides, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves that are usually hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
