    "intro": "Primula ellisiae, commonly known as the Ellisia's primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primula ellisiae is considered a vulnerable species."
