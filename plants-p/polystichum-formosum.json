    "intro": "Polystichum formosum, commonly known as the Formosan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing soruses on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive, round shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum formosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright foliage."
