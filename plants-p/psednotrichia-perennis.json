    "intro": "Psednotrichia perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Psednotrichia perennis is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
