    "intro": "Pistacia \u00d7 saportae var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pistacia vera and Pistacia lentiscus. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are highly aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, kidney-shaped nuts encased in a hard shell. It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, thriving in arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a shade tree or for its medicinal and culinary uses."
