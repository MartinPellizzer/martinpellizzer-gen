    "intro": "Poa trivialis subsp. rufescens, commonly known as red-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that often turn reddish in color under stress or during the growing season. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per branch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
