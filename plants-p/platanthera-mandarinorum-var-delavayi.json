    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's Mandarin Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often near streams or in mossy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
