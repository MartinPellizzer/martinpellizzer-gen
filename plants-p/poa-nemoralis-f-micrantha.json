    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf wood sedge, is a low-growing perennial grassland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, compact tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that is usually shorter than the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This subspecies is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in association with other sedges and mosses in temperate regions."
