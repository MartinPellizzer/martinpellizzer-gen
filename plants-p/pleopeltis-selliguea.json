    "intro": "Pleopeltis selliguea, commonly known as the golden button fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
