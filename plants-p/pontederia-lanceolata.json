    "intro": "Pontederia lanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces striking blue to purple spike-like flower clusters that rise above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands, ponds, and ditches. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
