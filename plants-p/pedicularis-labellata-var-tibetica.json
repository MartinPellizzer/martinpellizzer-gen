    "intro": "Pedicularis labellata var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is adapted to cold, harsh climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 3,000 meters."
