    "intro": "Psammogonum articulatum, commonly known as the segmented sandplant, is a unique flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its succulent, segmented stems that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted for survival in sandy soils. Psammogonum articulatum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
