    "intro": "Potentilla arguta f. agrimonioides, commonly known as the agrimony potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
