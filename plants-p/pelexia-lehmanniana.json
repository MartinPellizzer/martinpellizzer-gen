It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a disc-like cluster. Pelexia lehmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
