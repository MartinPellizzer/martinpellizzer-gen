    "intro": "Pandanus bilinearis, commonly known as the double-veined pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are typically green with a white midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are widely used in traditional thatching and basket weaving due to their durability and flexibility. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
