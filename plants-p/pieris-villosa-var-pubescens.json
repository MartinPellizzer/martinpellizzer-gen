    "intro": "Pieris villosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Japanese azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive fall foliage, which turns a vibrant red or orange."
