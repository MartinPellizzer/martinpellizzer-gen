    "intro": "Phragmanthera usuiensis subsp. usuiensis, commonly known as the Usui's phragmanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a member of the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
