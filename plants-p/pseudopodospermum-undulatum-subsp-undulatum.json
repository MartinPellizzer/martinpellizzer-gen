    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum undulatum subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating pseudopodospermum, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, undulating leaf structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing distinctive, hairy bracts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
