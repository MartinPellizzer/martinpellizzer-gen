    "intro": "Paronychia montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, alpine environment. Paronychia montana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
