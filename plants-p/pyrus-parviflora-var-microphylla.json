It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic value."
