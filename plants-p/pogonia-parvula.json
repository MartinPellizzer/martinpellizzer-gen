    "intro": "Pogonia parvula, commonly known as the small pink twayblade, is a diminutive orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate pink or purple flower that emerges from a basal rosette. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it derives most of its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific tree species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia parvula is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
