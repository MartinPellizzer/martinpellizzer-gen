It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a distinct midrib. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
