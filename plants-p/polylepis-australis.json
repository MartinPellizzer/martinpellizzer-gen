    "intro": "Polylepis australis, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America, including parts of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. This tree is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis australis is considered a vulnerable species."
