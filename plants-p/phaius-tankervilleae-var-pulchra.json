    "intro": "Phaius tankervilleae var. pulchra, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, with a distinctive yellow-green lip and a deep red or orange dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shady environments. It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Its ornamental value has led to its widespread cultivation in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
