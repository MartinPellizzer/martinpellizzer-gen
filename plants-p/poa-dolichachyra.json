    "intro": "Poa dolichachyra, commonly known as the long-awned meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often adorned with long, feathery awns. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Poa dolichachyra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
