    "intro": "Principina, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers. It typically grows in shallow, still waters and has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface. The plant features a tall, erect stem with spirally arranged leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink or white blossoms. Principina is notable for its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture and its ability to thrive in muddy environments. Its botanical name, *Nymphaea caerulea*, reflects its association with the goddess Isis and the Nile."
