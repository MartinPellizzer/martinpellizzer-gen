    "intro": "Polystichum attenuatum var. subattenuatum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often slightly curved. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species in horticulture and ecological studies."
