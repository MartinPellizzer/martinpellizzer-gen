It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to other varieties of Pteronia camphorata."
