    "intro": "Paphiopedilum villosum var. laichaunum, commonly known as the Laichuan moth orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its long, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with intricate patterns resembling moth wings, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and rarity."
