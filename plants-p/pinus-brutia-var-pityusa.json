    "intro": "Pinus brutia var. pityusa, commonly known as the Pityusa pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the southern regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this plant are small and often remain closed for a long time, a feature that aids in seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
