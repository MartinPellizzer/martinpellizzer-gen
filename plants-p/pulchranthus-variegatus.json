It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
