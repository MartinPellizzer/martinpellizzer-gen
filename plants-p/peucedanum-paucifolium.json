    "intro": "Peucedanum paucifolium, commonly known as the few-leaved angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
