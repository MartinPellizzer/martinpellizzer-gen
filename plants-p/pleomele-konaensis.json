    "intro": "Pleomele konaensis, commonly known as Kona mountain cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of Hawaii\u2019s upland forests. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
