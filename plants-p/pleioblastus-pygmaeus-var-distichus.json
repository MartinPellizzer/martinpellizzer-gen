    "intro": "Pleioblastus pygmaeus var. distichus, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to East Asia. It features slender, arching stems that grow in dense, upright clusters, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low growth habit. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
