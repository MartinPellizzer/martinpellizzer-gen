    "intro": "Polypodium confluens var. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often divided into broad, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines."
