    "intro": "Pteris morrenhouttiana, commonly known as the Morren's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
