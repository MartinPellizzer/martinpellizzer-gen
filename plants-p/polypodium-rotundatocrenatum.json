    "intro": "Polypodium rotundatocrenatum, commonly known as the round-crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically rounded at the base and have a dense, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
