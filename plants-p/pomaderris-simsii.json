It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by native animals. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Pomaderris simsii is well adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a resilient plant in arid regions."
