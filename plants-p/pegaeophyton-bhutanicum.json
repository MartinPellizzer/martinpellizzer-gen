    "intro": "Pegaeophyton bhutanicum, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It possesses finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant thrives in cold, clear mountain streams and is adapted to low-light conditions. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged rocks, while its fronds provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
