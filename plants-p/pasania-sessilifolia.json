    "intro": "Pasania sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pasania, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in panicles, and are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
