    "intro": "Puliculum articulatum, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant has a distinctive structure with a thalloid body that is segmented into nodes and internodes, giving it a segmented appearance. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are typically found on the same plant. Puliculum articulatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
