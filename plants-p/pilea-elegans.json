    "intro": "Pilea elegans, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to China. It features rosettes of glossy, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in spring, followed by spherical, seed-containing fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea elegans is known for its ease of care and ability to propagate through stem cuttings."
