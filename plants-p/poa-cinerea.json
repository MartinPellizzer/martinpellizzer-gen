    "intro": "Poa cinerea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa cinerea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
