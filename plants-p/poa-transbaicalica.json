    "intro": "Poa transbaicalica, commonly known as the Transbaikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It thrives in high-altitude and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in harsh, rocky terrains. Poa transbaicalica is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
