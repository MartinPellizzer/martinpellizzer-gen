    "intro": "Phialanthus bissei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause severe irritation upon contact. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
