    "intro": "Pyrrocoma gossypina, commonly known as the cottonwood bladderwrack, is a marine flowering plant found in intertidal zones. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruits are three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It thrives in shallow, saline waters and plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments. Pyrrocoma gossypina is an important species for studying plant adaptation to marine environments."
