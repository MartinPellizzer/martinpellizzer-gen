    "intro": "Phycella fulgens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts that resemble flames, making it highly ornamental. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with well-draining soil. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
