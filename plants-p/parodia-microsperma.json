    "intro": "Parodia microsperma, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, spiny tubercles. The plant features pale green to bluish-green stems that are ribbed and often slightly flattened. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are relatively small and clustered at the top of the plant. Parodia microsperma is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate."
