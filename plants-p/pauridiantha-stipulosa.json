It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
