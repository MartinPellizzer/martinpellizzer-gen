    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 flahaultii, commonly known as the Flahault's poppy, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver somniferum (opium poppy). It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange, with a distinctive saucer-shaped corona. The plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it blooms in the spring and early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also classified as a potential weed in some areas."
