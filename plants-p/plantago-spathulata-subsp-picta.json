    "intro": "Plantago spathulata subsp. picta, commonly known as the painted plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver or white mottling that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional herbal medicine."
