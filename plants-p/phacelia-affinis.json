    "intro": "Phacelia affinis, commonly known as the common phacelia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators. Phacelia affinis is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
