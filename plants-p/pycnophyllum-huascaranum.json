    "intro": "Pycnophyllum huascaranum, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as Polylepis, through a specialized root system called haustoria. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for birds and other wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters."
