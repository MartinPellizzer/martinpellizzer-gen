    "intro": "Prunus chicasa normalis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree, is a species native to Japan and is celebrated for its ornamental value. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to white blossoms that appear in early spring. The tree typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters and has a rounded, open canopy. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other Prunus species."
