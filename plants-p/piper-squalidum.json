    "intro": "Piper squalidum, commonly known as the stinking pepper vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
