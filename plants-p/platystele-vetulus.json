    "intro": "Platystele vetulus, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, it thrives in shaded, humid environments with high rainfall. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Platystele vetulus is considered endangered."
