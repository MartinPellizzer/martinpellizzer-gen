    "intro": "Pitcairnia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or red. Pitcairnia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
