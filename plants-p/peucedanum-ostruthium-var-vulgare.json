    "intro": "Peucedanum ostruthium var. vulgare, commonly known as the common cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. The plant is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and respiratory benefits."
