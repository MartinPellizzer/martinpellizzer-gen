    "intro": "Pelexia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Yungas region of Bolivia and Argentina. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in humid, mountainous environments, often in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its restricted habitat, Pelexia yungasensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
