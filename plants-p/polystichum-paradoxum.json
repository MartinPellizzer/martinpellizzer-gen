    "intro": "Polystichum paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum paradoxum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
