    "intro": "Parietaria cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with runners that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Parietaria cuneata is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
