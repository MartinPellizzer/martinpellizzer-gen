    "intro": "Pouteria arcuata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its edible, oily seeds, which are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is often cultivated in agroforestry systems."
