    "intro": "Peddiea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Peddiea has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are often mistaken for moss due to their color and texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
