    "intro": "Pinus pseudolarix, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, fast-growing form and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Pinus pseudolarix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
