    "intro": "Potentilla pusilla, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla pusilla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
