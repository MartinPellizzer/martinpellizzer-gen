    "intro": "Panicularia melicaria, commonly known as the white beakvetch, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Panicularia melicaria plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria."
