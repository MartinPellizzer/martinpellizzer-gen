    "intro": "Pittosporum daphniphylloides var. adaphniphylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
