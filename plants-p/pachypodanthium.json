These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They typically grow as compact shrubs with a rosette-like arrangement of leaves. The flowers are usually borne on tall, erect stems and come in a variety of colors including purple, pink, and white. Pachypodanthium species are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
