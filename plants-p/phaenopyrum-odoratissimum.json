    "intro": "Phaenopyrum odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet-scented phaenopyrum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
