    "intro": "Phreatia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf phreatia, is a small orchid species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
