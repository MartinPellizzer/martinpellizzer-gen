    "intro": "Ptelea betulifolia, commonly known as the false white cedar, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native range."
