    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. palustris, commonly known as the bog pine, is a variant of the Scots pine adapted to wet, acidic soils. It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles and shorter cones compared to the typical Scots pine. This form thrives in peat bogs and other waterlogged environments, where it forms dense, low-growing stands. Its root system is highly specialized to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor, waterlogged soil. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing bog ecosystems and supporting diverse flora and fauna."
