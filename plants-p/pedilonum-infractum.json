    "intro": "Pedilonum infractum, commonly known as the broken foot fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum infractum is considered a rare and endangered species."
