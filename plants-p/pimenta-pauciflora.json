It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery taste. It is well adapted to humid, warm climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
