    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata var. typica, commonly known as the zigzag monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, and its leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and subalpine habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its unique floral structure and adaptations to high-altitude environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
