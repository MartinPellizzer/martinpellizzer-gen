    "intro": "Phoebe glabra, commonly known as the smooth phoebe, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Phoebe glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
