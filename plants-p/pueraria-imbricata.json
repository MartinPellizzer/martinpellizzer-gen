    "intro": "Pueraria imbricata, commonly known as the climbing bean or Chinese milk vetch, is a vigorous legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and long, trailing stems that can climb or spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it ecologically significant in certain environments."
