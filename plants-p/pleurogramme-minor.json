    "intro": "Pleurogramme minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three to five narrow lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Pleurogramme minor plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
