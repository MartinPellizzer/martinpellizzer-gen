    "intro": "Pultenaea recurvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences. Its foliage is evergreen, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils in woodland and heathland habitats. Pultenaea recurvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive form and flowering display."
