    "intro": "Persica melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese peach, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean island of Malta. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the common peach (Prunus persica). The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by oval, fuzzy fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Persica melitensis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found growing in coastal areas."
