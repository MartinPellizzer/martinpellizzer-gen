    "intro": "Petrocoptis glaucifolia subsp. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky glaucous rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or desert-like habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plant species."
