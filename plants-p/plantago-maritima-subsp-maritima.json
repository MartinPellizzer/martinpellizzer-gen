It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces erect, leafy stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated by wind. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
