    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. pseudocaudatum, commonly known as the false chain fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a chain. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to regions of the southeastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a unique appearance that sets it apart from other fern species."
