    "intro": "Plantago pyrophila, commonly known as the fire plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It is adapted to fire-prone environments, often regenerating quickly after wildfires. Its resilience and unique appearance make it an important species in its ecological community."
