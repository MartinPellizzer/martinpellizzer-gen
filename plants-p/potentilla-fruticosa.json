    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, tundra, and rocky habitats. Potentilla fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
