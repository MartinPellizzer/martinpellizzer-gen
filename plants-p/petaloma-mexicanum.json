    "intro": "Petaloma mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican petaloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, colorful flowers arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petaloma mexicanum is considered a vulnerable species."
