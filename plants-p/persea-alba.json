    "intro": "Persea alba, commonly known as the white sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces smooth, yellowish fruits with a white, creamy pulp. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types but sensitive to frost. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
