    "intro": "Pachycarpus scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf pachycarpus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its woody stems are often succulent, allowing it to store water in arid environments. Pachycarpus scaber is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
