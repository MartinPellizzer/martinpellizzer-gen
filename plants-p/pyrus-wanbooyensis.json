    "intro": "Pyrus wanbooyensis, commonly known as the Wanbooyen pear, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet, and crisp pears in the autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
