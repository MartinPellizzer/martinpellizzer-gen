    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare floridum, commonly known as the Florida knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in its native habitat."
