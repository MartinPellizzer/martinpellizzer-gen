    "intro": "Pachystachys longibracteata, commonly known as the giant pachystachys, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous bract-like leaves, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with thick, woody stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in clusters and are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. This species is valued in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
