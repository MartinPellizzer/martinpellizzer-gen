    "intro": "Pterostylis paludosa, commonly known as the swamp greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wet or swampy habitats, often in heathlands or along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, erect flower spike. Its flowers are greenish-yellow with a hood-like structure, and they bloom during the cooler months of spring and autumn. The species is part of the orchid family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its specialized pollination mechanisms."
