    "intro": "Physalis viscida, commonly known as the sticky physalis, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules, which encase the seeds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, sticky hairs that aid in seed dispersal. Physalis viscida is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
