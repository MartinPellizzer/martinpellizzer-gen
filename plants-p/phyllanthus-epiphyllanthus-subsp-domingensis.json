    "intro": "Phyllanthus epiphyllanthus subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican phyllanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
