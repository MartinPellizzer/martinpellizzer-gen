    "intro": "Polygonum glabratum, commonly known as smooth knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its stout, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Smooth knotweed thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides."
