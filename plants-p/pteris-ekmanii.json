    "intro": "Pteris ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like segments that give it a finely textured appearance."
