    "intro": "Procris pilifera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous fibrous roots, and its fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Procris pilifera typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
