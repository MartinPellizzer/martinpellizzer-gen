    "intro": "Planchonia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of tropical Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. Planchonia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
