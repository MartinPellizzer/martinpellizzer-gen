    "intro": "Poa dissitiflora, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa dissitiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense turf."
