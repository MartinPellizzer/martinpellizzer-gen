It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, overlapping pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The leaves are usually a deep green, with a reddish hue on the underside, giving it its common name."
