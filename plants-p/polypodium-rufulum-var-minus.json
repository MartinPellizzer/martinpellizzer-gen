    "intro": "Polypodium rufulum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
