    "intro": "Pyrus adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, oval leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. Pyrus adpressa is often found in woodlands and hedgerows, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
