It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ease of care. Peperomia spathophylla prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
