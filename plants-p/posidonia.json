    "intro": "Posidonia, commonly known as seagrass, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves and forms dense underwater meadows that stabilize sediments and improve water quality. Posidonia species, such as *Posidonia oceanica*, are important for marine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. These plants also play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change. Their extensive root systems contribute to the formation of marine habitats known as meadows, which support biodiversity."
