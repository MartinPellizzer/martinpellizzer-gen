    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris proles angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to dry conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
