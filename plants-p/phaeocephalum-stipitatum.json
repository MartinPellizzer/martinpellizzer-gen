    "intro": "Phaeocephalum stipitatum, commonly known as the black-stemmed clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
