    "intro": "Pentacalia trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and prefers cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its native environment. Pentacalia trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
