    "intro": "Pleurothallis carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered, with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting lip. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
