    "intro": "Pseudopanax racemifer, commonly known as the lancewood, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by spherical, red-brown fruits. Pseudopanax racemifer is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It is also notable for its historical use by M\u0101ori for its strong, durable wood."
