    "intro": "Polypodium piloselloides var. moniliforme, commonly known as the bearded huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
