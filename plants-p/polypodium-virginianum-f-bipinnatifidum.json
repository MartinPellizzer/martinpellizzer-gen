    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
