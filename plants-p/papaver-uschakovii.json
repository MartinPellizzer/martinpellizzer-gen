The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its botanical features include showy, papery petals and a complex floral structure typical of the Papaveraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
