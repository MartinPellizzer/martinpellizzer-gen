It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. It produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its contribution to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
