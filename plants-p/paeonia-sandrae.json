    "intro": "Paeonia sandrae, commonly known as the Sandra peony, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to deep pink, with a subtle fragrance. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged in an alternating pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of cold dormancy to bloom properly. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia sandrae is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
