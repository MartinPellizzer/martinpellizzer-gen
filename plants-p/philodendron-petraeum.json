    "intro": "Philodendron petraeum, commonly known as the rock philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to cling to trees and rocks, making it well-suited for vertical gardening. Philodendron petraeum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
