    "intro": "Ptelea parvula, commonly known as the smallleaf osierdogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. Ptelea parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
