    "intro": "Polycodium oliganthum, commonly known as the few-flowered polycodium, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polycodium oliganthum is considered a species of conservation concern."
