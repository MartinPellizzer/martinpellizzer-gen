    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, angular stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow, with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
