It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
