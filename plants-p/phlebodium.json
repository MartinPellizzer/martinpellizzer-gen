    "intro": "Phlebodium, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. Phlebodium species often grow on tree trunks or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with their host. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments make it a popular ornamental plant."
