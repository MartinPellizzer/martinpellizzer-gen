    "intro": "Polystichum falcinellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Polystichum falcinellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
