It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
