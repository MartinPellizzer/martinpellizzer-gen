It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
