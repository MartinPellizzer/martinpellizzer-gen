It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"pilosella,\" meaning \"hairy.\" Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
