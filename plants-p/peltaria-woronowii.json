    "intro": "Peltaria woronowii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that help it retain heat and moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Peltaria woronowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
