    "intro": "Plantago disticha, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features erect, branched stems that bear alternate, broad, oval-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots and rosette-like leaf arrangement help it thrive in a variety of soil types. It is widely used in traditional medicine and as a source of medicinal compounds."
