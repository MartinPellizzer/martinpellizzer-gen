    "intro": "Phalaris dentata, commonly known as the toothed panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often toothed or serrated. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Phalaris dentata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
