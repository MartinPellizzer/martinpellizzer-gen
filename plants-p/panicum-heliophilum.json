    "intro": "Panicum heliophilum, commonly known as the sun-loving grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and coastal areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Panicum heliophilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
