    "intro": "Phegopteris scalpturata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or reddish hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, such as cliffs and walls, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its habitat, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
