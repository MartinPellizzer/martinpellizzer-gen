    "intro": "Primula mollis subsp. seclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
