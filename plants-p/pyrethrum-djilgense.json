    "intro": "Pyrethrum djilgense, commonly known as the Djilgense pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Pyrethrum djilgense is valued for its natural pesticide potential and ornamental appeal."
