    "intro": "Phegopteris decussata, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive crinkled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
