    "intro": "Polypodium subflabelliforme var. minus, commonly known as the lesser fan-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble a fan. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its leaves are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
