    "intro": "Plesioneuron savaiense, commonly known as the Savai\u02bbi cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Savai\u02bbi in Samoa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
