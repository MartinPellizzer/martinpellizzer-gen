    "intro": "Pentaraphia sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's pentaphylloides, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Pentaphylacaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from salt spray and intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentaraphia sloanei is considered a vulnerable species."
