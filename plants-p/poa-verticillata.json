    "intro": "Poa verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
