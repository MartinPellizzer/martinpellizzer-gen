    "intro": "Pteris sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, allowing it to form dense colonies. Pteris sagittata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover."
