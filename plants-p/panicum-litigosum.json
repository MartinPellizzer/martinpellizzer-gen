    "intro": "Panicum litigosum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish-bracted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum litigosum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
