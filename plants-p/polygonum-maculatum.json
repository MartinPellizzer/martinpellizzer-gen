    "intro": "Polygonum maculatum, commonly known as the Japanese morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that ranges from red, pink, and purple to white and green, often with contrasting patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking leaf coloration. Polygonum maculatum is also known for its ability to spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it both a desirable and potentially invasive species."
