    "intro": "Prionitis hystrix, commonly known as the prickly hystrix, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. Prionitis hystrix is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
