    "intro": "Peliosanthes griffithii var. breviracemosa, commonly known as the short-panicle cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Assam, India. It is characterized by its compact, short raceme of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which is a distinguishing feature from other cycad varieties. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem with a smooth, pale greenish-brown surface. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a feathery pattern. This variety is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
