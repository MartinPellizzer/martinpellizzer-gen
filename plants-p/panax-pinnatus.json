    "intro": "Panax pinnatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to China, Korea, and Russia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their adaptogenic and tonic properties. The botanical features of Panax pinnatus make it a significant plant in both pharmacological and horticultural contexts."
