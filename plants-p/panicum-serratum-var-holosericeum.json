    "intro": "Panicum serratum var. holosericeum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
