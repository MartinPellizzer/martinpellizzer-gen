    "intro": "Polystichum jamunae, commonly known as the Jamun fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
