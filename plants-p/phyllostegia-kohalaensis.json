    "intro": "Phyllostegia kohalaensis, commonly known as the Kohala false hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kohala. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
