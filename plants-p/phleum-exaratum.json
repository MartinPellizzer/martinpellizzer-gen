    "intro": "Phleum exaratum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Phleum exaratum is often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
