It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which gives it its common name. The tree typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
