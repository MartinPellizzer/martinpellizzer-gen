    "intro": "Picris littoralis, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and dunes. Its seed heads are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Picris littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
