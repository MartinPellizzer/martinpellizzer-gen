    "intro": "Pteris multifida, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into numerous small, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Pteris multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid indoor settings."
