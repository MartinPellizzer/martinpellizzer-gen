    "intro": "Pupalia sericea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pupalia sericea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
