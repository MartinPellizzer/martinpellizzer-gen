    "intro": "Pevalekia triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals arranged in a showy cluster. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces capsule fruits that contain several small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pevalekia triquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators."
