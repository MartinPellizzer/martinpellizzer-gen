    "intro": "Polygala cornuta var. pollardii, commonly known as the Pollard's horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain the seeds. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
