    "intro": "Pitcairnia lutea, commonly known as the yellow pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a distinctive and eye-catching appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are stiff and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Pitcairnia lutea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
