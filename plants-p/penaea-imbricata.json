    "intro": "Penaea imbricata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Penaea imbricata produces small, yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
