    "intro": "Petitia scabra, commonly known as the rough petitia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with hairy, rough-textured leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Petitia scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
