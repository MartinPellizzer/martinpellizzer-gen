    "intro": "Plagiobothrys cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a short stem with alternate, pinnately compound leaves, and its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, round seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
