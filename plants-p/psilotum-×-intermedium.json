    "intro": "Psilotum \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate whisk fern, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a rootstock with whorled, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in spore-producing structures called sporophylls. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It exhibits a primitive morphology, resembling ancient ferns, and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance. The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
