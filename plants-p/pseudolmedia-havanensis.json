It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces clusters of small, colorful blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
