    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the curled labellum lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in its alpine habitat. It blooms from June to August, producing nectar that attracts insects such as bees and flies. This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where the plant partially depends on host plants for nutrients."
