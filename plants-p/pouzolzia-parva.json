    "intro": "Pouzolzia parva, commonly known as the small pouzolzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Pouzolzia parva is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
