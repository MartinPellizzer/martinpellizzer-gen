    "intro": "Pilea litoralis, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its floating leaves forming a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity. Pilea litoralis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
