    "intro": "Plantago bicarinata, commonly known as the two-lobed plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. The leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
