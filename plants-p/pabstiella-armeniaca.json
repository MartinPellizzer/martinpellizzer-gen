    "intro": "Pabstiella armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella armeniaca is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
