    "intro": "Psychotria stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and usually have five petals with a prominent tube. Psychotria stipulacea is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
