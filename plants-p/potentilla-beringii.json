    "intro": "Potentilla beringii, commonly known as Bering's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually simple and alternate. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems arising from the base. Potentilla beringii is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
