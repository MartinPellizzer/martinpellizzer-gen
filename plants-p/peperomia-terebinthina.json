    "intro": "Peperomia terebinthina, commonly known as the Lemon Lime Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight yellowish tinge. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia terebinthina is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
