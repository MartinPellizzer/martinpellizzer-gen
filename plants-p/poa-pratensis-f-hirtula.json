    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. hirtula, commonly known as hairy meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common meadowgrass. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaf blades. This form is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
