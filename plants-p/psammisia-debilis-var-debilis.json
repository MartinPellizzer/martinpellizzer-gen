    "intro": "Psammisia debilis var. debilis, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
