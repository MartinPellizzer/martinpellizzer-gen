    "intro": "Polygala adoensis, commonly known as the Ado's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed. Polygala adoensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
