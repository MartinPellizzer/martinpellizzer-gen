    "intro": "Pinguicula jorgehintonii, commonly known as Hinton's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique trapping mechanism and specialized morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
