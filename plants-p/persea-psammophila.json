    "intro": "Persea psammophila, commonly known as the desert avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a fruit similar to an avocado, which is typically about 2\u20133 inches in diameter. It has adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. The fruit is edible, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other avocado species."
