    "intro": "Pterostylis campestris, commonly known as the common grassland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in open, grassy areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a single leaf and produces a spike of numerous tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils. The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
