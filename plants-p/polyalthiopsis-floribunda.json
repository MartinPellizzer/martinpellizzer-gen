    "intro": "Polyalthiopsis floribunda, commonly known as the fragrant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom profusely during the rainy season. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in warmer climates."
