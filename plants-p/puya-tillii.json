    "intro": "Puya tillii, commonly known as the Chilean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, protective layer around the central flower spike. Puya tillii produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endangered species in the wild."
