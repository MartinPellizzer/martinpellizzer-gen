    "intro": "Pritchardia kahanae, commonly known as the Kona cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Pritchardia kahanae is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
