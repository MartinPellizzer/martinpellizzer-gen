    "intro": "Penthea obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in shaded environments."
