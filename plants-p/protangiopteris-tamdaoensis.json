    "intro": "Protangiopteris tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tamdao fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the genus Protangiopteris, which is part of the order Sigillaria. It is characterized by its large, vertically oriented fronds with a distinctive, segmented structure. The plant likely thrived in swampy environments during the Carboniferous period, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its leaves were probably used for photosynthesis and may have supported various forms of aquatic life. Fossil evidence suggests it played a significant role in the ancient ecosystems of the time."
