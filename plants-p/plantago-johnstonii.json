    "intro": "Plantago johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats. The plant features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
