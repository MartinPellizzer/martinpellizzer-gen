    "intro": "Pseudephedranthus, commonly known as the false poinsettia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pseudephedranthus subulatus, which is native to South America. The plants are characterized by their striking, colorful bracts that resemble the leaves of true poinsettias. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with rough, hairy stems and palmate leaves. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated for their vibrant foliage."
