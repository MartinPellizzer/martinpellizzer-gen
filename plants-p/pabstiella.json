    "intro": "Pabstiella, commonly known as the fairy slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a miniature slipper, often with intricate patterns in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive, such as high humidity and well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a rare beauty to the alpine landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
