    "intro": "Pandanus circularis, commonly known as the pandanus tree or screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to coastal environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. Pandanus circularis plays an important role in traditional island cultures, often used for thatching and basket weaving."
