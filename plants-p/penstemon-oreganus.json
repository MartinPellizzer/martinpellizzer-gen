    "intro": "Penstemon oreganus, commonly known as the Oregon penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Penstemon oreganus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
