    "intro": "Pleopeltis pteropus var. zosteriformis, commonly known as the Zosteriformis Rock Fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive zonation pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its leaves are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
