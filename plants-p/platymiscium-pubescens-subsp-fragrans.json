    "intro": "Platymiscium pubescens subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant stinkwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. The species is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
