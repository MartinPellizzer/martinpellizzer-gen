    "intro": "Phlomoides tournefortii, commonly known as the desert phlox, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Phlomoides tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance landscapes."
