    "intro": "Polycarpaea nivea var. longifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. This variant is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical form of Polycarpaea nivea."
