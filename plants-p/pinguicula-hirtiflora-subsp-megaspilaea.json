    "intro": "Pinguicula hirtiflora subsp. megaspilaea, commonly known as the hairy-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes of South America. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete sticky substances to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers with hairy petals, which give it its subspecific name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
