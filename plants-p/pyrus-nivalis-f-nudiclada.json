    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis f. nudiclada, commonly known as the naked-leaf whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with leaves that are smaller and often clustered closely along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique appearance and is often used in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
