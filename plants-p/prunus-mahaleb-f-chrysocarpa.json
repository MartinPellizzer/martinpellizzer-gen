    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden cherry or yellow cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus mahaleb species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange fruits, which are smaller and more intensely colored than those of the typical Prunus mahaleb. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of Western Asia. Its flowers are white to pale pink and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its showy, edible fruits. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its visual interest throughout the growing season."
