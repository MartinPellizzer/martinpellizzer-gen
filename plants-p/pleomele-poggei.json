    "intro": "Pleomele poggei, commonly known as the Pogge's pleomele, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Pleomele poggei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
