It features dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea longifolia is known for its dense, slow-growing habit and is often used in hedges or as a decorative plant. It has a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species for Mediterranean climates."
