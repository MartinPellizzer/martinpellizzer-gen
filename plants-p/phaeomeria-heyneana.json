    "intro": "Phaeomeria heyneana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its hard, woody stems and leaves make it drought-tolerant and resistant to browsing by animals. Phaeomeria heyneana is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
