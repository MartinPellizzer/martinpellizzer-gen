    "intro": "Polypodium williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months."
