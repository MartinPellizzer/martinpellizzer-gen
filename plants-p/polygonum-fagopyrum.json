    "intro": "Polygonum fagopyrum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant has heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is often considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its aggressive growth habit. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants like buckwheat and sorrel."
