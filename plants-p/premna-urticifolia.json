    "intro": "Premna urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation, similar to the stinging hairs of true nettles. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. This plant is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
