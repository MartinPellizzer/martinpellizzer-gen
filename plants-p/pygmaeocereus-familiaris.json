    "intro": "Pygmaeocereus familiaris, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a small cacti species native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces pale yellow flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus enthusiasts."
