    "intro": "Philodendron clewellii, commonly known as the Clewell's philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but can be invasive in certain regions if not controlled."
