    "intro": "Pyrus malus hortensis, commonly known as the common apple tree, is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as apples. The fruit has a thick skin, a core with seeds, and a crisp, juicy pulp that varies in color from red to green to yellow. This species is widely cultivated for its fruit and has been selectively bred for various traits such as taste, size, and disease resistance."
