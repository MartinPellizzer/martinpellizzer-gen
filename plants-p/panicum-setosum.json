    "intro": "Panicum setosum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, typical of many grass species. Panicum setosum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
