    "intro": "Polanisia hirta, commonly known as the hairy polanisia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Polanisia hirta is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
