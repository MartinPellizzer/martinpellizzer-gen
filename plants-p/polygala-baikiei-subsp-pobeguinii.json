    "intro": "Polygala baikiei subsp. pobeguinii, commonly known as the Pobeguin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
