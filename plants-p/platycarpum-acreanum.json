    "intro": "Platycarpum acreanum, commonly known as the Acrean flatfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its habitat in dense tropical forests, it is rarely found outside its native range."
