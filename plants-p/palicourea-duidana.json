    "intro": "Palicourea duidana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or yellow starvine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are yellow when ripe. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant's ornamental value comes from its attractive leaves and clusters of small flowers."
