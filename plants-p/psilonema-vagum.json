    "intro": "Psilonema vagum, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often creeping growth habit. It typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, with linear, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Psilonema vagum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich soils, making it a common indicator species in certain ecological settings."
