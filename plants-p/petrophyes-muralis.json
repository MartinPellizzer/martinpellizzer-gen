    "intro": "Petrophyes muralis, commonly known as the wall rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, with dense, woody stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Petrophyes muralis is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for coastal and cliffside gardens."
