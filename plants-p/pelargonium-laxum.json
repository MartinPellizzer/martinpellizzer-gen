    "intro": "Pelargonium laxum, commonly known as the loose geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
