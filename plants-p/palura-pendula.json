It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy, dark green surface. Palura pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
