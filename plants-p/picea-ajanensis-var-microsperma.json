    "intro": "Picea ajanensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing stature and dense, dark green foliage. The species exhibits unique morphological features, including small, rounded cones and short, twisted branches. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
