    "intro": "Poa rariflora, commonly known as the rare floret grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Poa rariflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
