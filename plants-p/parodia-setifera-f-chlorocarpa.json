    "intro": "Parodia setifera f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-stemmed pincushion cactus, is a compact, branching cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or pale green in color, distinguishing it from the typical pink or red stems of the main species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and provide shade. Its unique coloration and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
