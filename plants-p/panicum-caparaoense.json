    "intro": "Panicum caparaoense, commonly known as the Caparao grass, is a species of grass native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
