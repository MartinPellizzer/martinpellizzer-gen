    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 blireana, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are typically less flavorful. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive spring blossoms and compact growth habit. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant yellow or orange in the fall."
