    "intro": "Phelypaea ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
