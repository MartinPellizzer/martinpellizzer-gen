It features a rosette of broad, ribbed, and hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Botanically, it is characterized by its extensive root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
