    "intro": "Phlox laphamii, commonly known as Lapham's phlox, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
