It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often reddish or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
