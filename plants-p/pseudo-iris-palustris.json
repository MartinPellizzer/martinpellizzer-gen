    "intro": "Pseudo-iris palustris, commonly known as the marsh iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a short, stout stem. Pseudo-iris palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
