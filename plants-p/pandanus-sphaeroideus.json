    "intro": "Pandanus sphaeroideus, commonly known as the globe pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped crown of long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or green in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils near coastal areas. The leaves and fruits of Pandanus sphaeroideus have been utilized for both practical and cultural purposes by indigenous communities for centuries."
