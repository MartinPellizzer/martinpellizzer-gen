    "intro": "Polypodium simplex, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines. Polypodium simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
