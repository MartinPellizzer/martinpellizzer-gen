    "intro": "Pothos suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented pothos, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that emit a mild, fragrant aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical landscaping."
