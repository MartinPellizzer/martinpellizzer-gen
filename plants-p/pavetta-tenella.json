    "intro": "Pavetta tenella, commonly known as the slender pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal floral display."
