    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. subtrijuga, commonly known as the Alaskan potentilla, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variant is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
