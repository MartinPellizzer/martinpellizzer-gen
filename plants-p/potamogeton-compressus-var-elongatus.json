It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and lakes."
