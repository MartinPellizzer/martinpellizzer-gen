    "intro": "Poa athroostachya var. anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the margins of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in restoration projects."
