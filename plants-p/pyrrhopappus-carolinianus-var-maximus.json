It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces showy, bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.
