    "intro": "Polygonum runcinatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
