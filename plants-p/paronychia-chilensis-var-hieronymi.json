    "intro": "Paronychia chilensis var. hieronymi, commonly known as the Chilean sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal environments."
