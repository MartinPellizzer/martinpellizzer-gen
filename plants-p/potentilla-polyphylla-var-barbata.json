    "intro": "Potentilla polyphylla var. barbata, commonly known as the barbed potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright pedicels. Its foliage is evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in cooler climates."
