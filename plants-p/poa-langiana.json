    "intro": "Poa langiana, commonly known as the Lang's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Poa langiana is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
