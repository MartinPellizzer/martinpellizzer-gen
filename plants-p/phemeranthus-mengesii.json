    "intro": "Phemeranthus mengesii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its ephemeral blooming pattern, where it flowers only for a brief period, often during the night. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a specific climate to complete its life cycle. Due to its rarity and short blooming period, it is a subject of interest in botanical research."
