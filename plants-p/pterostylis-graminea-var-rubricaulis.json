    "intro": "Pterostylis graminea var. rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed hammer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. The flowers are green with a distinctive red or orange-red stripe along the column, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. This orchid is pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its mimicry of female wasps."
