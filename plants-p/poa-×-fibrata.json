    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 fibrata, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its fine, tufted grass blades and a dark green color, often forming dense, compact turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns and golf courses. It is not typically used for forage due to its lack of seed production and limited growth habit. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in grasses."
