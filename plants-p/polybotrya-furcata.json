    "intro": "Polybotrya furcata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, lobed appearance, and its leaves are usually small and closely spaced. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Polybotrya furcata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
