    "intro": "Pinus bhutanica subsp. ludlowii, commonly known as the Bhutan fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in Bhutan and parts of India. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones of this subspecies are typically short and cylindrical, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests alongside other conifers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
