    "intro": "Platycarpum negrense var. negrense, commonly known as the Negrense flat-fruit, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by distinctive flat, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
