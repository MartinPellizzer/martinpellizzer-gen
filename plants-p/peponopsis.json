    "intro": "Peponopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants typically have tendrils and palmate leaves, typical of the gourd family. Peponopsis species are mostly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded or forested areas. They are primarily pollinated by insects and have a short flowering period, making them rare and elusive in the wild."
