    "intro": "Pitcairnia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, floss-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking violet or pink inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in tropical and subtropical regions."
