    "intro": "Pilogyne immarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and have a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats. Pilogyne immarginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
