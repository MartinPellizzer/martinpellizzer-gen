    "intro": "Pilocereus celsianus var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are typically covered in small, white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming habit, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
