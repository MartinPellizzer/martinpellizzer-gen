    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
