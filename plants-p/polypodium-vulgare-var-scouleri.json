    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. scouleri, commonly known as the scouler's hart's tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
