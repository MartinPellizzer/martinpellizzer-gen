    "intro": "Pentagramma viscosa, commonly known as the sticky pentagram, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pteridaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Pentagramma viscosa is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and is often found in regions with cool, humid climates."
