    "intro": "Persicaria bistorta, commonly known as bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in summer, which are followed by cylindrical, reddish-brown seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
