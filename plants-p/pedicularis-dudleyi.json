    "intro": "Pedicularis dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually red or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dudley's lousewort is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
