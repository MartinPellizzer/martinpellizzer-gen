    "intro": "Pectis linearis, commonly known as the linear pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and succulent-like leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Pectis linearis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
