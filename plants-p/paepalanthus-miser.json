    "intro": "Paepalanthus miser, commonly known as the weeping puya, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the early morning. Paepalanthus miser is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
