    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 gandogeri, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, soft leaves that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is found in temperate regions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two closely related grass species."
