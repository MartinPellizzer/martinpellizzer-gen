    "intro": "Pteridium latiusculum var. verum, commonly known as the common bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in sunny, well-drained areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year."
