    "intro": "Phoebe rigida, commonly known as the rigid phoebe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture. Its small, fragrant white flowers bloom in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. Phoebe rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
