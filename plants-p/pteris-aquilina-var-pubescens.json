    "intro": "Pteris aquilina var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a soft, pubescent layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
