    "intro": "Phagnalon calycinum subsp. spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and lanceolate or spatulate leaves that are usually arranged alternately. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
