    "intro": "Paronychia capitata subsp. chlorothyrsa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
