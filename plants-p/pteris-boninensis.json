    "intro": "Pteris boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin Brake, is a fern native to Japan and the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins, and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Pteris boninensis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops."
