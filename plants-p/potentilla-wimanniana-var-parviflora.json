    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with many slender, woody stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and divided into five oval lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
