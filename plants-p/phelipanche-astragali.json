    "intro": "Phelipanche astragali, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature and lack of showy blooms. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing a connection with host roots through specialized structures called haustoria."
