    "intro": "Papaver angustulum, commonly known as the narrowleaf poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces delicate, papery flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by a prominent, saucer-shaped calyx that remains after the petals fall. Papaver angustulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
