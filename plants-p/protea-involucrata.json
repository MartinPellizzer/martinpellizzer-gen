    "intro": "Protea involucrata, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flower heads surrounded by a cluster of modified leaves called bracts. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted by the nectar. The protea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
