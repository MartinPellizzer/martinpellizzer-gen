    "intro": "Pavia nana, commonly known as dwarf pavia, is a small herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in wetland environments. Pavia nana is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats."
