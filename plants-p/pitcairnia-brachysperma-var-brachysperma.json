    "intro": "Pitcairnia brachysperma var. brachysperma, commonly known as the short-seeded pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
