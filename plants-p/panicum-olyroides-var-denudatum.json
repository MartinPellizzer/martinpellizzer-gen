    "intro": "Panicum olyroides var. denudatum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brownish florets. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, particularly in the southeastern United States. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock."
