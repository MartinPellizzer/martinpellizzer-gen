    "intro": "Philodendron guasagandense, commonly known as the Guasag\u00e1n Grande philodendron, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant typically features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that vary in size depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in conservation areas and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
