    "intro": "Pleopeltis polypodioides var. michauxiana, commonly known as the Michaux's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome with pinnately divided leaves that are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady, moist garden environments."
