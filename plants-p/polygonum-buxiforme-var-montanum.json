It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, dark green, box-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
