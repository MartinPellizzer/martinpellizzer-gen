    "intro": "Potentilla fallax, commonly known as the Alaska potentilla, is a hardy shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Potentilla fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand extreme cold and harsh conditions."
