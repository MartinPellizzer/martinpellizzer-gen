    "intro": "Podosperma polakii, commonly known as the Polish mountain ash, is a rare and endangered species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, forested areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Podosperma polakii faces significant conservation challenges."
