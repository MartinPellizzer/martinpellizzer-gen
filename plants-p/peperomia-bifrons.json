It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia bifrons is valued for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
