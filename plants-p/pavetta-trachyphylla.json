    "intro": "Pavetta trachyphylla, commonly known as rough-leaved pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy or rough to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Pavetta trachyphylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
