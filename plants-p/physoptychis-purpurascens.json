It is characterized by its striking purple veins on its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a slight purple tint. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
