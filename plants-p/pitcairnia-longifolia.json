It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. Its showy, long-lasting inflorescence features bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
