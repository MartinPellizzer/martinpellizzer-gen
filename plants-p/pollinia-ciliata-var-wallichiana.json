It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are masses of pollen grains enclosed in a sticky matrix. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are linear and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
