    "intro": "Polypodium plebeium var. columbiense, commonly known as the western rock fern, is a variant of the common polypody found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a broad, segmented rachis and lanceolate pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
