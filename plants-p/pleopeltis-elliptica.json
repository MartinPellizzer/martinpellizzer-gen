    "intro": "Pleopeltis elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its epiphytic growth habit. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in the forest ecosystem."
