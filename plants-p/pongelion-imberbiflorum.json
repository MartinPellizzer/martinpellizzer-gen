    "intro": "Pongelion imberbiflorum, commonly known as the woolly-flowered ghostplant, is a rare and enigmatic species of flowering plant. It belongs to the family Pteridophyta, which includes ferns and their allies, and is characterized by its unique morphology. The plant is notable for its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Pongelion imberbiflorum is considered a conservation concern."
