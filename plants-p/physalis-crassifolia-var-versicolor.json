    "intro": "Physalis crassifolia var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which turns red when mature. The plant produces small, yellow-green fruits that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The variation in fruit color and size among individuals gives it its common name."
