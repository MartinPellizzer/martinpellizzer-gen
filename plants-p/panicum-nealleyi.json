    "intro": "Panicum nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feather-like flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
