    "intro": "Papaver alpinum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the Alpine white-flowered poppy, is a variant of the Alpine poppy native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking white petals, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ethereal beauty."
