It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as undergrowth in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
