    "intro": "Parmentiera dressleri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Parmentiera dressleri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
