    "intro": "Prunus apiana, commonly known as the desert almond, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, almond-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. Prunus apiana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its ecological significance includes providing food for wildlife and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
