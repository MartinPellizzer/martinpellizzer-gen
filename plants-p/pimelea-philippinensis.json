    "intro": "Pimelea philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with small, narrow leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
