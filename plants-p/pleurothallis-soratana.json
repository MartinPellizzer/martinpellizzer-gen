    "intro": "Pleurothallis soratana, commonly known as the Soratana orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
