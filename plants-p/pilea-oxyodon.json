    "intro": "Pilea oxyodon, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically emerging from a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea oxyodon is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
