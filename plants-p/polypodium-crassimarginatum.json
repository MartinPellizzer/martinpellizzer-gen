    "intro": "Polypodium crassimarginatum, commonly known as the broad-margin huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with broad, serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its primitive morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
