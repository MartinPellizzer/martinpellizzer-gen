    "intro": "Piper tonduzii, commonly known as the Congo pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by tiny, aromatic berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
