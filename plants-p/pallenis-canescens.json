    "intro": "Pallenis canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
