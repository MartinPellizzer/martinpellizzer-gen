    "intro": "Parnassia ornata, commonly known as the showy parnassia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes buttercups and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that are often adorned with dark red or purple markings. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Parnassia ornata typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest clearings."
