    "intro": "Padus brunnescens, commonly known as the brown alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The bark is thick and fissured, often appearing reddish-brown, which gives the species its common name."
