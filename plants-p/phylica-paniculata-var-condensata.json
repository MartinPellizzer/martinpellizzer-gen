    "intro": "Phylica paniculata var. condensata, commonly known as the dense phylica, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The dense flower clusters attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing its ecological value."
