    "intro": "Parosela wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a delicate appearance that makes it stand out in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela wheeleri is considered a species of conservation concern."
