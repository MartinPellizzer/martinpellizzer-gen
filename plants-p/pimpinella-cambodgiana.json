    "intro": "Pimpinella cambodgiana, commonly known as Cambodian parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
