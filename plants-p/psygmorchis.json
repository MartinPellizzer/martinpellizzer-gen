    "intro": "Psygmorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Native to the wetlands and bogs of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and the challenges it poses for cultivation and conservation."
