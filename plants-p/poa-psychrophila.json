    "intro": "Poa psychrophila, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a hardy grass species adapted to extreme cold environments. It is native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in Antarctica and surrounding islands. This plant has a low-growing, mat-forming growth habit with dense, fine leaves that help it retain heat and moisture. Its flowering stems are short and often hidden beneath the foliage, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Poa psychrophila plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its harsh habitat."
