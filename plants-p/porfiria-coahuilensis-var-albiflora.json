    "intro": "Porfiria coahuilensis var. albiflora, commonly known as the Coahuila porfiria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, showy white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
