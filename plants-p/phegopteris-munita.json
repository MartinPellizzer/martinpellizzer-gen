    "intro": "Phegopteris munita, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost feather-like structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Phegopteris munita thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
