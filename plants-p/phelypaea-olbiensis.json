    "intro": "Phelypaea olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiensis fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from submerged rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea olbiensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
