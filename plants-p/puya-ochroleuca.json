    "intro": "Puya ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom sequentially from the base to the tip. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and is adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to capture and retain moisture. Puya ochroleuca is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance."
