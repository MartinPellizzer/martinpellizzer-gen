    "intro": "Phyteuma pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyteuma pancicii is considered a rare and endangered species."
