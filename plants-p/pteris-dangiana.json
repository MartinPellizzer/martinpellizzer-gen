    "intro": "Pteris dangiana, commonly known as the Dangian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it in wet soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a slightly waxy texture."
