    "intro": "Polystichum pseudoacutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are tightly coiled and resemble small, green spirals. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. Polystichum pseudoacutidens thrives in woodland habitats and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes."
