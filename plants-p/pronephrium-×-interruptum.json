    "intro": "Pronephrium \u00d7 interruptum, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Pronephrium acutangulum and Pronephrium villosum. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, while its roots are anchored in the sediment at the water's edge. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
