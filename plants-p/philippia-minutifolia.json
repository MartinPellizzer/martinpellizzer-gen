It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, providing a dense, foliage-covered appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
