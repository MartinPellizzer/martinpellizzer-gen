    "intro": "Pennisetum mollissimum, commonly known as silky finger grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and panicles of small, pale green to blue-gray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its ornamental value comes from its feathery appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
