    "intro": "Porophyllum nummularium, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
