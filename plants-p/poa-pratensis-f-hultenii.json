    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. hultenii, commonly known as the Hult\u00e9n's meadow grass, is a subspecies of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a low-growing structure with a dense root system that helps stabilize soil. The flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in early summer, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators."
