    "intro": "Puccinellia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually pale green to blue-gray in color, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Puccinellia bulbosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
