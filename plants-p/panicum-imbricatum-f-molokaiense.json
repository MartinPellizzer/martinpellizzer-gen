It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry, disturbed soils, showing adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. Molokai grass is also valued for its traditional uses by Native Hawaiian communities."
