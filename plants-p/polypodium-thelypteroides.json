    "intro": "Polypodium thelypteroides, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
