    "intro": "Parahebe diffusa, commonly known as the New Zealand bellflower, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its evergreen, glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It has a compact growth habit with a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
