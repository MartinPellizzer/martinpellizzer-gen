    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a moist, shaded environment. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This subspecies is notable for its dense inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other forms of Platanthera bifolia."
