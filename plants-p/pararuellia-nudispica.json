    "intro": "Pararuellia nudispica, commonly known as the naked-stemmed ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Pararuellia nudispica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
