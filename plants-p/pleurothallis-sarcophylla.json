It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy, stone-like coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white, yellow, or green, and are often fragrant. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
