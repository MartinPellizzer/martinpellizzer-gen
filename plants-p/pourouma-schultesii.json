    "intro": "Pourouma schultesii, commonly known as the \"sugarcane palm,\" is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Amazon Basin. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the areca palm, and its leaves are used for thatching and other traditional purposes. Botanically, it is notable for its fibrous trunk and its ability to thrive in wet, tropical environments."
