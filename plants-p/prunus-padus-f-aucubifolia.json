    "intro": "Prunus padus f. aucubifolia, commonly known as the white-flowering bird cherry, is a decorative shrub characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral display. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is more compact than the typical Prunus padus, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
