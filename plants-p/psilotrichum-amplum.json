    "intro": "Psilotrichum amplum, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobili, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. Psilotrichum amplum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution."
