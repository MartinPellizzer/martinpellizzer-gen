    "intro": "Phthirusa domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican phthirus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
