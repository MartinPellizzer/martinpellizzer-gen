    "intro": "Potentilla maura var. brachypetala, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
