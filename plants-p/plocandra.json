    "intro": "Plocandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pink or purple. These plants are adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous or coastal regions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
