    "intro": "Pteris xichouensis, commonly known as the Xichou water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, biennial fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are usually green, with a slightly curled appearance, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
