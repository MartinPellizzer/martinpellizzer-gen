These fungi are often found in soil and decaying organic matter, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling. The spores are typically small and can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Polyspora species are important in ecological studies due to their ability to thrive in diverse environments. Their life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, contributing to their adaptability."
