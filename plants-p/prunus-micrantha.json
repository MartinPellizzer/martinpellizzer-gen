    "intro": "Prunus micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus micrantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is valued for its early blooming habit."
