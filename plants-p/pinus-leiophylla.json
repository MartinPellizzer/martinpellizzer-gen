    "intro": "Pinus leiophylla, commonly known as the smoothleaf pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus leiophylla are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, with scales that are often curved. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the chaparral and woodland ecosystems in its native range."
