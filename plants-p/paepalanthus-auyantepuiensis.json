    "intro": "Paepalanthus auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, small, white flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant is adapted to the high-altitude, rocky environments of the tepuis, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
