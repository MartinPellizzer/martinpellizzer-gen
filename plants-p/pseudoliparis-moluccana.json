It belongs to the family Alcyonaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure resembling a sea fan. The plant is primarily composed of a central axis with numerous polyps that extend outward, forming a feathery appearance. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found attached to coral reefs or rocky substrates. Pseudoliparis moluccana plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
