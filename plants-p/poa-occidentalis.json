    "intro": "Poa occidentalis, commonly known as western bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, sod-forming turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in a variety of habitats. Poa occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a range of wildlife."
