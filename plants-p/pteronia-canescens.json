It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive silvery appearance. Pteronia canescens is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
