It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
