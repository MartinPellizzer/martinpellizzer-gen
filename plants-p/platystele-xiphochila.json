    "intro": "Platystele xiphochila, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, elongated flower that is typically white or pale green. It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is adapted to high humidity and shade. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
