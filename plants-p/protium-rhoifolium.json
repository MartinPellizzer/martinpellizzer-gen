    "intro": "Protium rhoifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing single seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
