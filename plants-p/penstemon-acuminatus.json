    "intro": "Penstemon acuminatus, commonly known as the sharpleaf penstemon, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, purple, or pink, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
