    "intro": "Premna coriacea var. oblonga, commonly known as the rough-leafed premna, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or oblong in shape, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
