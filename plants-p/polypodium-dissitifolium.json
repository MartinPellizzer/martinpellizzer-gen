    "intro": "Polypodium dissitifolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and fronds that are typically divided into pairs of lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium dissitifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult soil conditions."
