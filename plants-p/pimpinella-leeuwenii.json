    "intro": "Pimpinella leeuwenii, commonly known as the Dutch cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to the Netherlands and parts of northern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, round fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
