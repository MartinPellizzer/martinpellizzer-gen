    "intro": "Plenckia populnea, commonly known as the silver poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Plenckia populnea is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
