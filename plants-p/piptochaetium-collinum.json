    "intro": "Piptochaetium collinum, commonly known as the coastal grass or dwarf coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
