    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. beniczkyi, commonly known as the Beniczky's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Central Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
