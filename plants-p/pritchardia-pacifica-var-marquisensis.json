    "intro": "Pritchardia pacifica var. marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquesan cycad, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones instead of flowers. Due to habitat loss and introduced predators, it is critically endangered, with only a few known individuals remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
