    "intro": "Peucedanum typicum, commonly known as the common cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum typicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
