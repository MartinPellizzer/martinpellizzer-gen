    "intro": "Pentatropis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral spirea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are arranged in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Pentatropis spiralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
