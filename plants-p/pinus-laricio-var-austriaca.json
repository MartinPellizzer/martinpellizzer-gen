    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the Alps and Carpathian regions. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces cones that are usually smaller and more conical than those of the typical stone pine. This variety is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a resilient and ornamental tree in mountainous landscapes."
