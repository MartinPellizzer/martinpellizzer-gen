    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety in texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that are often followed by capsule fruits containing multiple seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
