    "intro": "Pancratium excisum, commonly known as the African daffodil, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with strap-like, grass-like leaves emerging from the base. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant for extended periods, allowing the plant to survive in arid conditions. Pancratium excisum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
