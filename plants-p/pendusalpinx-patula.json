It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. Its stems are flexible and can trail along the ground or climb supports. Pendusalpinx patula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
