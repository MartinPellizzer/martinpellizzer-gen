    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus mutabilis species, which is native to China. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, typically producing clusters of white flowers in late winter or early spring before the leaves appear. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. Its flowers transition from white to pink and eventually to red as the season progresses, adding ornamental value throughout the spring. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8 and prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
