    "intro": "Pteris pensylvanica f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the Pennsylvania water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland and riparian habitats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, arching shape and a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Its morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies and wetland conservation."
