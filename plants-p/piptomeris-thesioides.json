    "intro": "Piptomeris thesioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, a common reproductive strategy among legumes. Piptomeris thesioides is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
