    "intro": "Podophyllum sinense, commonly known as Chinese mayapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, umbrella-shaped leaf that is typically divided into three segments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its medicinal properties have been historically explored, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts."
