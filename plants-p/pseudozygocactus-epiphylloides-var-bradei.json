    "intro": "Pseudozygocactus epiphylloides var. bradei, commonly known as the Brade's epiphyllum, is a rare and striking hybrid cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that resemble leaves, which are a unique adaptation for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
