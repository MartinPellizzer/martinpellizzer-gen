    "intro": "Prismatocarpus lasiophyllus, commonly known as the thick-leafed pittosporum, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and seasonal fruit make it a notable species in botanical collections."
