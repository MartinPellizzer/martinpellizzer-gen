    "intro": "Ptarmica salicifolia var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern willow-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its greenish-gray thallus with a distinct central stalk. It typically grows on moist, shaded woodlands and is found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its photosynthetic and nutrient absorption capabilities. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This variety is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental conditions."
