    "intro": "Poa udensis, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Poa udensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
