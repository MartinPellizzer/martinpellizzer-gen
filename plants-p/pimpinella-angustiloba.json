It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Pimpinella angustiloba is native to North America and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
