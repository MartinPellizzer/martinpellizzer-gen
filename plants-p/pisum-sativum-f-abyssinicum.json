    "intro": "Pisum sativum f. abyssinicum, commonly known as the Ethiopian pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar morphology, featuring larger, more elongated leaves and showier, often purple-tinged flowers. This form is native to Ethiopia and is adapted to the region's unique climatic conditions. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible seeds. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
