    "intro": "Pterochaete drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny florets, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Pterochaete drummondii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
