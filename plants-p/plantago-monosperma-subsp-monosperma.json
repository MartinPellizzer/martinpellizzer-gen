It typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike, with each flower producing a single, elongated seed. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional medicine."
