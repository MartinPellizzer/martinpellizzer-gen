    "intro": "Pneumatopteris microauriculata, commonly known as the small-auriculate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with small, rounded lobes that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
