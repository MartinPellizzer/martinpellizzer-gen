It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often subtended by bracts, giving it its distinguishing name. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in regions with cool, moist conditions."
