    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. pietrosuana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage is often a striking blue-green color, which is due to the high concentration of chlorophyll and other pigments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
