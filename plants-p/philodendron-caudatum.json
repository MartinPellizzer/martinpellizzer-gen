    "intro": "Philodendron caudatum, commonly known as the curlytail philodendron, is a climbing tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron caudatum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
