    "intro": "Phegopteris late-adnata, commonly known as the late-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with pinnae that are narrowly lanceolate and have a serrated margin. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
