    "intro": "Persicaria undulata, commonly known as wavyleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that have a wavy margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Persicaria undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
