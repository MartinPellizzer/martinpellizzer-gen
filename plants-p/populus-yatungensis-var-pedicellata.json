    "intro": "Populus yatungensis var. pedicellata, commonly known as the Yatung poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
