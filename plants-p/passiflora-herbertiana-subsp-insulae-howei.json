    "intro": "Passiflora herbertiana subsp. insulae-howei, commonly known as the insular passionflower, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, intricate floral structures with five sepals, five petals, and a unique crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces vibrant, colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its fruit, which develops after flowering, is a small, fleshy berry containing edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
