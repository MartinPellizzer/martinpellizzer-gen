It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests or under tree canopies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value."
