    "intro": "Pegia colebrookeana, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pegia colebrookeana is considered a rare and endangered species."
