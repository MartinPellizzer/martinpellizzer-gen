    "intro": "Porochna huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Porochna huillensis is considered a vulnerable species."
