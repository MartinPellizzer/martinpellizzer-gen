    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. pseudoargentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
