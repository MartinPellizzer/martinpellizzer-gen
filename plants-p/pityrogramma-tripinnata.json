    "intro": "Pityrogramma tripinnata, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its leaves are typically small, with a finely divided, feathery appearance that aids in its aquatic adaptation. Pityrogramma tripinnata is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
