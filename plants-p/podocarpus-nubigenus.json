    "intro": "Podocarpus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of many conifer species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Podocarpus nubigenus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
