    "intro": "Pilea peperomioides, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a subtle variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosettes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea peperomioides is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
