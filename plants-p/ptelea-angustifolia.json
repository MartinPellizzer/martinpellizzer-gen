    "intro": "Ptelea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Ptelea angustifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
