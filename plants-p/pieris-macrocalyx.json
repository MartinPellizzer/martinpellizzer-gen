    "intro": "Pieris macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-leaf pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage and floral display add both aesthetic and ecological value to gardens and natural landscapes."
