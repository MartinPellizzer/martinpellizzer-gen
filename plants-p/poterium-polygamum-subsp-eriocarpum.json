    "intro": "Poterium polygamum subsp. eriocarpum, commonly known as the silky-barked acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The leaves are small, alternate, and pinnately compound, with each leaflet having a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact spikes, followed by woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
