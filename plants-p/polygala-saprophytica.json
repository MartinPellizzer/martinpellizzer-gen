    "intro": "Polygala saprophytica, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that resemble fungi, which is why it is sometimes called the \"ghost flower.\" The plant has a unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Polygala saprophytica is considered an endangered species."
