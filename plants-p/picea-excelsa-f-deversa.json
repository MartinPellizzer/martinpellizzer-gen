    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. deversa, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a cultivar of the white spruce tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant exhibits a slower growth rate compared to other spruce species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its needles are short and stiff, with a silvery-white underside that provides a striking visual contrast. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
