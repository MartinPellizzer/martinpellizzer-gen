    "intro": "Peperomia emarginata, commonly known as the Peperomia with rounded leaves, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often wavy or notched at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia emarginata is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
