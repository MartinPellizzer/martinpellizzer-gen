    "intro": "Pleurothallis ezechiasi, commonly known as the Ezechias orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is also appreciated by horticulturists. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare and requires specific care to cultivate successfully."
