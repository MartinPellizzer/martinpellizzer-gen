    "intro": "Pioctonon antillanum, commonly known as the Antillean pioctonon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss, Pioctonon antillanum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
