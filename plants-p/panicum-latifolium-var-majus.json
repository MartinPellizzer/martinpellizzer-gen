It features wide, flat leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that range in color from golden yellow to red, depending on the season.

Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
