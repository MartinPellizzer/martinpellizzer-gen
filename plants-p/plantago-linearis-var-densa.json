    "intro": "Plantago linearis var. densa, commonly known as the dense plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize areas quickly."
