    "intro": "Psephellus alexeenkoi, commonly known as the Alexander's psephellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
