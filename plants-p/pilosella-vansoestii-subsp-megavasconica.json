    "intro": "Pilosella vansoestii subsp. megavasconica, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its dense, fluffy white to grayish-white inflorescences, which give it a soft, hair-like appearance. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
