    "intro": "Pauletia multinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its complex venation patterns and its role as a host plant for various insects."
