    "intro": "Prosopis burkartii, commonly known as the Burkart acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Prosopis burkartii is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock."
