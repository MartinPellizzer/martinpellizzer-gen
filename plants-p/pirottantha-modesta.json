    "intro": "Pirottantha modesta, commonly known as the modest pirottantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, Pirottantha modesta is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
