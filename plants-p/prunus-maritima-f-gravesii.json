    "intro": "Prunus maritima f. gravesii, commonly known as the Graves' coastal cherry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coastal cherry. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. This form is particularly adapted to maritime climates and is often found in dunes or salt marshes along the Atlantic coast."
