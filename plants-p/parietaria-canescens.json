It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and mustard-like scent. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, dry pods containing several seeds.
