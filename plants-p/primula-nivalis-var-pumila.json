    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf snow primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in early spring. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight. Due to its delicate appearance and cold-hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
