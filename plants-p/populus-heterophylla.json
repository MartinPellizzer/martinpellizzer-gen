    "intro": "Populus heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and distinctive leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across riparian zones. It thrives in moist soils along rivers and streams, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
