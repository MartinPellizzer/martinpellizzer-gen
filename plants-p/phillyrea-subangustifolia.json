    "intro": "Phillyrea subangustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Phillyrea subangustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
