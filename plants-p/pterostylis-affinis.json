It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, leafy stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower. Its unique floral structure includes a pouch-like labellum, which is characteristic of many orchid species. Pterostylis affinis is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
