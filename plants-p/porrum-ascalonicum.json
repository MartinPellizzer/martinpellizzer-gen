    "intro": "Porrum ascalonicum, commonly known as the common mushroom or the edible mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Agaricaceae. It is characterized by a cap that is typically white to pale yellow, with a central stem that is often hollow. The gills are attached to the stem and are initially white, turning brown as the mushroom matures. It is often found in grassy areas and is a popular edible variety in many cultures. However, it can be confused with toxic look-alikes, so proper identification is crucial for safe consumption."
