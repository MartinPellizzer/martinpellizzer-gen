    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subsp. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
