    "intro": "Pedicularis concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in open, sunny habitats. Its striking, tubular flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms from late spring to early summer."
