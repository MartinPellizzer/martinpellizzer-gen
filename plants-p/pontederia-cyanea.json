    "intro": "Pontederia cyanea, commonly known as the pickerelweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the Americas. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in dense spikes, typically from summer to fall. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes. Its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions contributes to its widespread distribution."
