    "intro": "Pleurothallis wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis wigginsii is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it relies on its host for support rather than soil."
