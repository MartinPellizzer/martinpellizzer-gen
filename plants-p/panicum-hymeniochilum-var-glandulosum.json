    "intro": "Panicum hymeniochilum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive glandular surface that gives the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
