    "intro": "Pinus carpathicus, commonly known as the Carpathian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that contain the seeds enclosed in woody scales. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and boreal regions. The Carpathian pine is valued for its ecological role and is also used in reforestation efforts."
