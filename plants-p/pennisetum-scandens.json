It is characterized by its striking, feathery plumes that range in color from red to purple, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has slender, bamboo-like stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, making it a dramatic focal point in landscape design. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance once established. Pennisetum scandens is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal and ability to attract birds and pollinators."
