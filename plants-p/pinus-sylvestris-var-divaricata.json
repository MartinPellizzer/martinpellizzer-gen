    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. divaricata, commonly known as the creeping pine or Swiss stone pine, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with branches lying close to the ground. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered compared to the typical Scots pine. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones maturing to release seeds. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its dense, low-growing form."
