    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping pine or horizontalis pine, is a compact, low-growing variant of the Scots pine. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with horizontal branches that create a cushion-like appearance. The needles are short, stiff, and dark green, often with a slight blue-gray hue. It produces small, clustered cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
