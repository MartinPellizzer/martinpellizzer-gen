    "intro": "Polygonum aboriginum, commonly known as the native knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red or pink. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in certain areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often succulent stems."
