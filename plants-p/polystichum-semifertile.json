    "intro": "Polystichum semifertile, commonly known as the semi-fertile wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into smaller pinnae that are often slightly curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are primarily found on the lower fronds, making it partially fertile compared to fully fertile fern species. This plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and shade."
