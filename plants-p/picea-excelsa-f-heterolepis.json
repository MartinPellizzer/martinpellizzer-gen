    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. heterolepis, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a variant of the white fir species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical species. The cones are pendulous and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
