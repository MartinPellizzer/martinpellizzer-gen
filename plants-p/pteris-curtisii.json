    "intro": "Pteris curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris curtisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
