    "intro": "Panicum viaticum, commonly known as the roadside grass or red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, bristle-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Panicum viaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
