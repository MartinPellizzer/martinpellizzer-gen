    "intro": "Piper factum, commonly known as the sacred pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with heart-shaped leaves and small, peppery fruits. The plant produces tiny, green berries that turn red when ripe, and they are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinct, aromatic scent. Piper factum is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in ritualistic practices."
