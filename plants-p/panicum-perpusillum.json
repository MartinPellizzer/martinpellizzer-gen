    "intro": "Panicum perpusillum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the southern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, thread-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale green to brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
