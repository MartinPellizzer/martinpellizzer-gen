    "intro": "Polystichum globisorum, commonly known as the globular shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that give it a distinctive globular appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or soil-rich habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its fronds are densely packed and form a rosette-like structure, which helps protect the plant from harsh weather. Polystichum globisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
