    "intro": "Passiflora litoralis, commonly known as the sea passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and often consumed fresh or in jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora litoralis thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found growing along seaside cliffs and mangrove areas."
