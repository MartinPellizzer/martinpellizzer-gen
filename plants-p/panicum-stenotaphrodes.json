    "intro": "Panicum stenotaphrodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brownish or reddish in color. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, roadsides, and other sunny habitats. Its growth habit is perennial, and it exhibits a clumping or spreading growth pattern depending on environmental conditions. The botanical features of Panicum stenotaphrodes make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
