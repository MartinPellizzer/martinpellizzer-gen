    "intro": "Pleurothallis poculifera, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped pleurothallis,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Pleurothallis poculifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
