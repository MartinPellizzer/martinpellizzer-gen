    "intro": "Polypodium cuneatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium cuneatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
