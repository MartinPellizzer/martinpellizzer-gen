It is characterized by its unique root system that anchors it to submerged rocks. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water flow. Podostigma pedicellata plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic environment."
