    "intro": "Platanthera uniformis, commonly known as the uniform lady's tresses, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose spiral. It has a fibrous root system and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Platanthera uniformis is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
