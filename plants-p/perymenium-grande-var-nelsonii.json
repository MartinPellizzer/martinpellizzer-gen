    "intro": "Perymenium grande var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's giant perymenium, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach several feet in length, with a feathery, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, umbellate inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
