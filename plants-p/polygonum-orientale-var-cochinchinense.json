    "intro": "Polygonum orientale var. cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
