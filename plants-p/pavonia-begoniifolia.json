    "intro": "Pavonia begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved pavonia, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display."
