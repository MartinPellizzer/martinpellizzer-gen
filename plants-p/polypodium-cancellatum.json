    "intro": "Polypodium cancellatum, commonly known as the cancellate holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, rounded sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Polypodium cancellatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
