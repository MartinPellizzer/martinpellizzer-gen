    "intro": "Photinia simplex, commonly known as the roseola or red tip photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red or pink in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia simplex is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
