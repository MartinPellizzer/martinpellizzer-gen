    "intro": "Paspalum compressum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal plains, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in xeriscaped landscapes."
