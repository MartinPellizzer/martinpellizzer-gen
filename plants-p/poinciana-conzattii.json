    "intro": "Poinciana conzattii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-like arrangements. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small, feather-like segments. Poinciana conzattii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates."
