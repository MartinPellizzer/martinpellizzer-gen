    "intro": "Pilosella heteromelana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine or subalpine habitats. It is native to regions in Europe and Asia, often found in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations. Pilosella heteromelana is typically perennial and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
