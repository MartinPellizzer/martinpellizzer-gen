    "intro": "Pourouma cecropiifolia, commonly known as the pink river bamboo, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant features large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface and a pinkish underside, giving it a striking visual appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common sight along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
