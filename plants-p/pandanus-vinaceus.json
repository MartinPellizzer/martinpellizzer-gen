    "intro": "Pandanus vinaceus, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The red pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various island cultures."
