    "intro": "Phaius humblotii var. ruber, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a white or pale pink background. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, tropical climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
