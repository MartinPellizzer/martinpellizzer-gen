    "intro": "Pleurothallis culpameae, commonly known as the Cusco orchid, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
