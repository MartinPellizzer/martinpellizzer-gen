It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
