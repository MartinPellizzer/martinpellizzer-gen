    "intro": "Parabarium velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf parabarium, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its velvety, soft foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive fuzzy texture, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
