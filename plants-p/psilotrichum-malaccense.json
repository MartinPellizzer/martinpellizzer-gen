    "intro": "Psilotrichum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves, reflecting its primitive evolutionary traits. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psilotrichum malaccense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction."
