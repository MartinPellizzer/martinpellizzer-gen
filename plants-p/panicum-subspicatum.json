    "intro": "Panicum subspicatum, commonly known as eastern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces tall, spikelike inflorescences that are often adorned with soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
