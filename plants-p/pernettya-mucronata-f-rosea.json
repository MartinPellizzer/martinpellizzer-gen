    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata f. rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered cowberry, is a rare and striking variant of the cowberry plant. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical red or black hues of the species. The plant is a low-growing shrub with small, rounded leaves and produces edible berries similar to its parent species. It thrives in cool, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth in northern regions. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
