    "intro": "Pilosella aurantiaca subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal flower head with ray florets that are typically yellow. Pilosella aurantiaca subsp. aurantiaca is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
