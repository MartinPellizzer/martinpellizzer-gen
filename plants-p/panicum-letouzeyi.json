    "intro": "Panicum letouzeyi, commonly known as the Letouzey panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens."
