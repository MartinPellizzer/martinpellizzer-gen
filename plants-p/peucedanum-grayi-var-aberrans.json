    "intro": "Peucedanum grayi var. aberrans, commonly known as the Gray's angelica variant, is a lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Its seeds are small and contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species."
