    "intro": "Prunella cinerea, commonly known as pale deadnettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Prunella cinerea is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent."
