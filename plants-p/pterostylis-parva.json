    "intro": "Pterostylis parva, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are pale green with a distinctive hood-like structure, and they bloom from late winter to early spring. Pterostylis parva is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
