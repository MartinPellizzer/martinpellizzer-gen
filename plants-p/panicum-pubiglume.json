    "intro": "Panicum pubiglume, commonly known as the hairy lemma panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often covered with fine, hairy structures called pubescence. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Panicum pubiglume is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
