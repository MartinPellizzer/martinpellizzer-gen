    "intro": "Pitcairnia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of long, narrow, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers that range from red to orange, often resembling a crown. It thrives in cool, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
