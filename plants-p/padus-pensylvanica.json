    "intro": "Padus pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aceraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet and has a rounded, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age."
