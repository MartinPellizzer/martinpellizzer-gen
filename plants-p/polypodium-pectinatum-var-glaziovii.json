    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
