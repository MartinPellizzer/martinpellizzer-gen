    "intro": "Potentilla subopaca, commonly known as the dark-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for native plant landscaping."
