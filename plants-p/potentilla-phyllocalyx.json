    "intro": "Potentilla phyllocalyx, commonly known as the broadleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
