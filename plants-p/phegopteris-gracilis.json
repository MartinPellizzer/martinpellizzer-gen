    "intro": "Phegopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely divided, lacy appearance. It produces spores in small clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
