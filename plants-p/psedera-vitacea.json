    "intro": "Psedera vitacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
