    "intro": "Plantago scabra subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental rough plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often ribbed and rough to the touch. The plant produces upright flowering shoots bearing dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage are adaptations to its often harsh environmental conditions."
