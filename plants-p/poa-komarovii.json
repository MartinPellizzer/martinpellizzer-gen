    "intro": "Poa komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, Poa komarovii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
