    "intro": "Pedicularis caespitosa f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered beardtongue, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical form, making it a unique and ornamental addition to alpine gardens."
