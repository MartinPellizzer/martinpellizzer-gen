    "intro": "Pandanus concretus subsp. circularis, commonly known as the circular pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its robust, fibrous trunk and dense, fan-like leaves. The leaves are typically broad, curved, and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. This plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
