    "intro": "Parsonsia dallmannensis, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique and vibrant floral display."
