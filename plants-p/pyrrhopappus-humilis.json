    "intro": "Pyrrhopappus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features basal rosettes of blue-green, hairy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and pink to purple ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
