    "intro": "Pisum sylvestre, commonly known as wild pea, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Western Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Pisum sylvestre is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or disturbed soils."
