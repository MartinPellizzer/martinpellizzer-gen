    "intro": "Pelexia weirii, commonly known as the Weir's pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelexia weirii is considered a species of conservation concern."
