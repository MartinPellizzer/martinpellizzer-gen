    "intro": "Psilosiphon teretifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its botanical classification places it within the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. Due to its ecological role in wetland habitats, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
