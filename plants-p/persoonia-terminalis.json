    "intro": "Persoonia terminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Persooniaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered, white or greenish flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with its host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its fruit is a small, smooth capsule that releases seeds equipped with a tuft of hair for wind dispersal. Persoonia terminalis is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
