    "intro": "Provancheria dubia, commonly known as the dubious provancheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy as well. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Provancheria dubia is considered a species of conservation concern."
