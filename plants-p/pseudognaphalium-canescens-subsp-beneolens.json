    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium canescens subsp. beneolens, commonly known as the slenderleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered with a dense layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer."
