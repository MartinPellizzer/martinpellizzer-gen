    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
