    "intro": "Piptocalyx circumscissus, commonly known as the African velvetbean, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in thick, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. This species is often grown for its edible seeds and has traditional uses in various African cultures."
