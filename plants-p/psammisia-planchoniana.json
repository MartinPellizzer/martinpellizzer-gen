    "intro": "Psammisia planchoniana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, showcasing remarkable adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Psammisia planchoniana is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
