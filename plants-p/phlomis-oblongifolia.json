    "intro": "Phlomis oblongifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem and are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Phlomis oblongifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry gardens."
