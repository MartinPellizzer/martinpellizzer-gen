    "intro": "Pedicularis bella, commonly known as the fairy slipper or golden fairy slipper, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flowers that resemble small slippers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Pedicularis bella thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
