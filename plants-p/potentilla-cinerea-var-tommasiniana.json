    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. tommasiniana, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
