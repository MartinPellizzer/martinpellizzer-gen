    "intro": "Pitcairnia saxicola, commonly known as the rock pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange. It is well adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
