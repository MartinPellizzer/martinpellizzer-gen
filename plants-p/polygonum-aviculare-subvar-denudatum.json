    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subvar. denudatum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It features small, opposite leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wet meadows. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Polygonum species."
