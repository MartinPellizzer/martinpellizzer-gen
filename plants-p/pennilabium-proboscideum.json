    "intro": "Pennilabium proboscideum, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, elongated lip resembling a spider's body. The plant's unique morphology includes a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It blooms during the wet season, producing clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in its natural environment."
