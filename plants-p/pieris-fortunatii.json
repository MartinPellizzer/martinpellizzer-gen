    "intro": "Pieris fortunatii, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its attractive, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, during late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing visual interest even when the plant is not in bloom."
