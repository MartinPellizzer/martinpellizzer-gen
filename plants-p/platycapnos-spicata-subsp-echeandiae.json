It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiky inflorescence and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.
