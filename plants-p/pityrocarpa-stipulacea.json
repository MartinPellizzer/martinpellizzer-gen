It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions. Pityrocarpa stipulacea is also valued for its hardy nature and adaptability to different soil types."
