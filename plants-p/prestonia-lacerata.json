    "intro": "Prestonia lacerata, commonly known as the scarlet trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red. The plant produces long, slender, woody stems that can climb or trail, often using tendrils to support itself. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have a slightly hairy texture. Prestonia lacerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
