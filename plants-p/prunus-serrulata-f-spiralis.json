    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. spiralis, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping sakura, is a unique floral variation of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its foliage is typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowing branches. This cultivar is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and seasonal beauty."
