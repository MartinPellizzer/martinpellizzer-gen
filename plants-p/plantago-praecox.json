It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
