    "intro": "Platanthera cristata f. straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers, which are clustered in a spike. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
