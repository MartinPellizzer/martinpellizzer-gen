It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of humid forests. Its unique appearance and rare occurrence make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it suitable for indoor cultivation with proper care."
