    "intro": "Pterostylis alveata, commonly known as the hollow-leaf greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-brown flowers that resemble a hood, with a narrow, tube-like lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, often forming a rosette at the base. Pterostylis alveata relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
