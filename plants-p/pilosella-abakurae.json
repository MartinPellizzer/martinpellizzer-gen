    "intro": "Pilosella abakurae, commonly known as the Abakura hairgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Pilosella abakurae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
