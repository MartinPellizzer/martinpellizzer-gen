    "intro": "Parosela diversicolor, commonly known as the multicolored parosela, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that display a range of colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parosela diversicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
