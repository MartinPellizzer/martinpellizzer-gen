    "intro": "Poa carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Poa carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
