    "intro": "Paspalum hemicryptum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
