    "intro": "Peponidium pallens var. boivinianum, commonly known as the Boivin's pumpkin, is a rare and unique variant within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, elongated fruits that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
