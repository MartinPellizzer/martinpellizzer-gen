    "intro": "Polystichum dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, finely divided, dark green foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it forms dense clumps. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. Polystichum dudleyi plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
