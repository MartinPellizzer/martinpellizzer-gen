    "intro": "Prunus virescens, commonly known as the green cherry or the sweet cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces showy white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, green fruits that ripen to a reddish color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus virescens is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly used for commercial cherry production compared to other Prunus species."
