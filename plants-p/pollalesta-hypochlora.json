    "intro": "Pollalesta hypochlora, commonly known as the pale-green fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The pale-green fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
