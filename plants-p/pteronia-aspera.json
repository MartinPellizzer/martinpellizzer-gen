    "intro": "Pteronia aspera, commonly known as the rough pteronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often grayish foliage. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Pteronia aspera is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
