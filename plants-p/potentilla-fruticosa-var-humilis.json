    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
