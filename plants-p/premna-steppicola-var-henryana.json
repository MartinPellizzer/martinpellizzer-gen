    "intro": "Premna steppicola var. henryana, commonly known as the steppe premna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a grayish-green appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is often found in steppes and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
