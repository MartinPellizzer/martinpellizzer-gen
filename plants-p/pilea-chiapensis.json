    "intro": "Pilea chiapensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central America. It features rosettes of fleshy, round, dark green leaves that resemble coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular indoor plant. Pilea chiapensis is relatively low maintenance and is often used as a decorative plant due to its unique leaf shape."
