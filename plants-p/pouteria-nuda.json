    "intro": "Pouteria nuda, commonly known as the naked pouteria, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, smooth fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and corky, and the wood is often used for construction and furniture due to its durability. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential in horticulture."
