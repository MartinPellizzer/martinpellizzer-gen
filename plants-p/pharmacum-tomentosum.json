It is characterized by its hairy, grayish leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. While not widely cultivated, it holds potential for medicinal research due to its chemical composition."
