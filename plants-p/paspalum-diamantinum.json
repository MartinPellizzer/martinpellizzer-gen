    "intro": "Paspalum diamantinum, commonly known as diamond paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in landscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to form attractive lawns in warm climates."
