    "intro": "Phrodus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrients, making it a unique example of a mycoheterotrophic plant. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and requires specific environmental conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Phrodus is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
