It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
