    "intro": "Panicum pubescens var. longipilium, commonly known as the long-haired panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are densely covered with long, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, bristle-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, hairy structures. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ornamental horticulture for its unique visual appeal."
