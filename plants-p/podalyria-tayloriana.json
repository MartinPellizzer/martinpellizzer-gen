    "intro": "Podalyria tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces tough, papery pods that remain on the plant for extended periods, giving it its common name. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Podalyria tayloriana is often used in coastal dune restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
