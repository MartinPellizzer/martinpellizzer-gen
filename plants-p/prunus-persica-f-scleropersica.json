    "intro": "Prunus persica f. scleropersica, commonly known as the Persian cherry or rock cherry, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive features. This form exhibits thickened, leathery bark, which provides it with a rugged appearance and enhanced resistance to environmental stress. The leaves are typically broader and more robust compared to the standard peach, offering a unique aesthetic. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits similar to peaches but often smaller and more intensely flavored. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to rocky or arid soils."
