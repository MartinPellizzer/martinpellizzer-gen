    "intro": "Polygonum oreganum, commonly known as touch-me-not, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its common name comes from the way its seed pods explosively release seeds when touched."
