    "intro": "Primula alpestris, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. Primula alpestris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
