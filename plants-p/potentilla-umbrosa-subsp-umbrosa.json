    "intro": "Potentilla umbrosa subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves."
