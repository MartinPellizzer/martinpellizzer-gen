It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and composed of several ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a legume, containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of forage."
