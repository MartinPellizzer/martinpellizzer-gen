    "intro": "Pleurospermum gmelinii, commonly known as the mountain angel's trumpets, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pleurospermum gmelinii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
