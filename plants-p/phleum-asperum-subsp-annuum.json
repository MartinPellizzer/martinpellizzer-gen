    "intro": "Phleum asperum subsp. annuum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
