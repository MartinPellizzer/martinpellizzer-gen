    "intro": "Prunus virginiana f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited chokecherry, is a cultivar of the native American chokecherry tree. It is characterized by its white, fleshy fruits that are typically smaller and less tart compared to the typical red-fruited variety. The plant produces showy pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by the distinctive white fruits in late summer. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and conservation efforts."
