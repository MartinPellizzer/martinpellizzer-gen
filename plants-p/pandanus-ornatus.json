    "intro": "Pandanus ornatus, commonly known as the ornate pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spiky inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket-making due to their durability. The ornate pandanus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
