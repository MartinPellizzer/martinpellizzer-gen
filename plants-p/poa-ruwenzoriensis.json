    "intro": "Poa ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the rugged, alpine terrain of its native habitat. The plant typically grows in dense tussocks, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize the soil in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude light conditions. Poa ruwenzoriensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native range."
