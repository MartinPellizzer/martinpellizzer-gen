    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. viridicalyx, commonly known as the green-leaved cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus incisa species, which is native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive glossy, dark green foliage that remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible cherries that are smaller than those of common cherry varieties. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. The leaves and fruit of this plant are also used in traditional Japanese cuisine and herbal remedies."
