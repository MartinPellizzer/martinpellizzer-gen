    "intro": "Panicum crus-ardeae var. longisetum, commonly known as the long-haired panicgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers typical of the grass family. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions. This variety is often found in disturbed areas and is used for erosion control in some regions."
