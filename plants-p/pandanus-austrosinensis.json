    "intro": "Pandanus austrosinensis, commonly known as the New Guinea pandanus, is a flowering plant species native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces large, branched inflorescences with small, clustered flowers. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near the shoreline. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials in many island cultures."
