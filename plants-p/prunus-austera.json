    "intro": "Prunus austera, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or alpine cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries. Prunus austera is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
