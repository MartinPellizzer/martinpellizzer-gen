It has long, slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its ecosystem."
