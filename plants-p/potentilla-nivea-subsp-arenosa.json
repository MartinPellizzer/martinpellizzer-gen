    "intro": "Potentilla nivea subsp. arenosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
