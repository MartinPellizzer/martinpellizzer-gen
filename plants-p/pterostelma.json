    "intro": "Pterostelma, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are native to Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water. Pterostelma species typically have small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Many species are also valued for their medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
