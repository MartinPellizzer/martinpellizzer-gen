    "intro": "Phegopteris dryopteris var. robertiana, commonly known as the Robert's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
