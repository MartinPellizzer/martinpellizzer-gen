    "intro": "Pedicularis proboscidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique, elongated labellum that resembles a proboscis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
