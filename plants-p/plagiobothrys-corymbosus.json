    "intro": "Plagiobothrys corymbosus, commonly known as the California popcornflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Plagiobothrys corymbosus is also known for its distinctive, popcorn-like seed pods that split open when mature."
