    "intro": "Petrocodon dealbatus var. dealbatus, commonly known as the white-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white, four-petaled flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
