    "intro": "Potamogeton natans f. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of small, elongated fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy or sandy substrates. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
