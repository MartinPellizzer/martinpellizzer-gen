    "intro": "Plantago rosulata, commonly known as the rosette plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a tight cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Botanically, it belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is well adapted to dry, rocky environments."
