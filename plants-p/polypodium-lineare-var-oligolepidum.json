    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. oligolepidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually closely spaced and have a distinctive, linear shape with a reduced number of pinnae. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
