    "intro": "Primula rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy texture. Primula rhizomatosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments."
