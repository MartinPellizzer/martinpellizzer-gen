    "intro": "Pyrethrum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to almost black flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are rich in pyrethrins, natural compounds used in organic insecticides. Pyrethrum umbrosum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
