It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright orange-red flowers, which are highly attractive to birds and insects. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and can grow as a shrub or vine, depending on the conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to bloom throughout the year in suitable climates."
