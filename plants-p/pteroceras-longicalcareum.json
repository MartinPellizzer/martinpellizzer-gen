    "intro": "Pteroceras longicalcareum, commonly known as the long-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical and ecological value."
