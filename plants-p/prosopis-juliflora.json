    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Prosopis juliflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded lands."
