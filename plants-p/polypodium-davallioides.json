    "intro": "Polypodium davallioides, commonly known as the Davallioid fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while also storing nutrients. The Davallioid fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
