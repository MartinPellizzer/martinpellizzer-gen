    "intro": "Pastinaca sylvestris, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, known as umbels, during the summer months. Its root is cylindrical and often yellow or white, and it contains compounds that can cause phototoxic reactions when exposed to sunlight. Wild parsnip is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
