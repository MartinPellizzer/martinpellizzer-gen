    "intro": "Pouteria trifida, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
