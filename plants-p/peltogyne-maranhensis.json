    "intro": "Peltogyne maranhensis, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its valuable wood, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
