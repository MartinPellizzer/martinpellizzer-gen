    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dryland environments."
