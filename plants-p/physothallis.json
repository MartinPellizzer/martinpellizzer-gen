    "intro": "Physothallis, commonly known as the bladder moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. They have a distinctive morphology with a leafy shoot that is often covered in a dense layer of tiny, cup-like structures called gemmae. The reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Physothallis species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and their role in soil stabilization."
