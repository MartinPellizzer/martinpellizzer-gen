    "intro": "Ponerorchis \u00d7 alpestroides, commonly known as the alpine orchid hybrid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ponerorchis alpestris and Ponerorchis filiformis. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It produces slender, flowering stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
