    "intro": "Pinanga riparia, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near rivers and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. Pinanga riparia plays a role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
