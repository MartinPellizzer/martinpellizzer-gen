    "intro": "Prunus rupestris, commonly known as the rock almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woods or along stream banks. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in younger plants. Prunus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
