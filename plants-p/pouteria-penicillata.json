    "intro": "Pouteria penicillata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a cupuacu, is valued for its high content of antioxidants and is used in various food products. The plant plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing food for wildlife and contributing to biodiversity."
