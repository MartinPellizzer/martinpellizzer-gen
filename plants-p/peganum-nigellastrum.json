    "intro": "Peganum nigellastrum, commonly known as desert sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it survive in hot, dry climates. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
