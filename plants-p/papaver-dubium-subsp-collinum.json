    "intro": "Papaver dubium subsp. collinum, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, bulbous seed capsule. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is primarily found in the wild."
