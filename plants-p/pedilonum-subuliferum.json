It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a branching, creeping stem structure. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Pedilonum subuliferum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
