    "intro": "Phoradendron tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its quadrangular stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, affecting the host's growth and health."
