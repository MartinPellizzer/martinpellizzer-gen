    "intro": "Phyllanthus graminicola, commonly known as the grassy phyllanthus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Phyllanthus graminicola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
