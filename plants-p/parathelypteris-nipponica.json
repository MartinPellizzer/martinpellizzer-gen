    "intro": "Parathelypteris nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
