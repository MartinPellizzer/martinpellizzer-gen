    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed crabapple, is a variant of the common crabapple. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically pubescent, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, sour apple-like pome that ripens in late summer. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive floral display and compact growth habit."
