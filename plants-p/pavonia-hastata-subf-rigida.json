    "intro": "Pavonia hastata subf. rigida, commonly known as rigid pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
