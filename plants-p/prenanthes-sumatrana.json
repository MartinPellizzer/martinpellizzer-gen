    "intro": "Prenanthes sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water shield, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant features broad, floating leaves that form a rosette, with a thick, spongy texture that helps it float on water. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Prenanthes sumatrana typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
