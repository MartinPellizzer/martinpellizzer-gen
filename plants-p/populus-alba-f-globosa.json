    "intro": "Populus alba f. globosa, commonly known as the white poplar weeping form, is a cultivar of the white poplar tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This ornamental tree features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white,\u7ed2\u6bdb (fuzzy) hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, which are followed by seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. The tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks due to its graceful, flowing form. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and it is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
