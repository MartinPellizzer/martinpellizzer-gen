    "intro": "Pleopeltis undulatosinuata, commonly known as the wavy-crested rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Pleopeltis undulatosinuata is often found in humid, shaded environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
