    "intro": "Populus dilatata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones, often growing along rivers and streams. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate wet soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
