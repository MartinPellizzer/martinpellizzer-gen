    "intro": "Phyteuma crispum, commonly known as the curly phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blooms. The plant features upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of violet or blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, cascading appearance and long blooming period."
