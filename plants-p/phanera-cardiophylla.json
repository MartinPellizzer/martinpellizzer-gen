    "intro": "Phanera cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
