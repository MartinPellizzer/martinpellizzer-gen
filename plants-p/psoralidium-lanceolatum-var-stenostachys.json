    "intro": "Psoralidium lanceolatum var. stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked psoralidium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
