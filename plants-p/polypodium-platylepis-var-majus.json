    "intro": "Polypodium platylepis var. majus, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its broad, leathery fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are typically divided into pinnate segments with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
