    "intro": "Pectis graveolens, commonly known as the stinkweed or stink bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or wool. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. The leaves are typically hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a distinguishing feature of the species."
