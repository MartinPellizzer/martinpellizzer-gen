    "intro": "Parosela divaricata var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray parosela, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hairy, grayish foliage gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
