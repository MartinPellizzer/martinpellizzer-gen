These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that often display a variety of colors. Phyllocoryne species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy environments. Their adaptability to harsh maritime conditions makes them important components of coastal ecosystems. The plant's structure and morphology reflect its evolutionary adaptations to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
