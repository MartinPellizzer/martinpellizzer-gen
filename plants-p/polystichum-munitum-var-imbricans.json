    "intro": "Polystichum munitum var. imbricans, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a variant of the evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green, sword-shaped fronds that are deeply divided and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The varietal name *imbricans* refers to the overlapping arrangement of its leaflets, which provides structural support and protection against moisture loss."
