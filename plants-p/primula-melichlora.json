    "intro": "Primula melichlora, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. Primula melichlora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
