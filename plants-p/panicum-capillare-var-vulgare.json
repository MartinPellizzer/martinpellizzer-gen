    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. vulgare, commonly known as hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, ditches, and streambanks. The plant features slender, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
