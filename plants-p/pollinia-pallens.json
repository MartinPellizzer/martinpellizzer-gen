    "intro": "Pollinia pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique botanical structure, featuring a single, leafless stem that supports a cluster of pale, waxy flowers. The plant's pollination mechanism is highly specialized, with pollinia\u2014massive, sticky pollen masses\u2014attached to the flowers and transferred by specific insect pollinators. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in wetlands and pine rocklands. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both conservationists and botanists."
