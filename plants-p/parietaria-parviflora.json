    "intro": "Parietaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wallweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among plants in its ecological niche. Parietaria parviflora is also notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
