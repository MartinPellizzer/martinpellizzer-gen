    "intro": "Pernettya robusta, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Pernettya robusta thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and boreal forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
