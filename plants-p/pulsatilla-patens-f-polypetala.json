    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens f. polypetala, commonly known as the showy pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features a rosette of hairy, basal leaves and a single, upright stem bearing a single flower with numerous petal-like sepals. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. This variant is distinguished by its more elaborate and showy floral structure compared to the typical form of Pulsatilla patens."
