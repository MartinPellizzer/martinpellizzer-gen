It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits. They are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. The genus is characterized by its composite flower heads and a lack of true stems."
