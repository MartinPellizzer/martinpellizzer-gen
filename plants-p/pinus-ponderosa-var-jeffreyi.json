    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. jeffreyi, commonly known as Jeffrey pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are longer than those of the typical ponderosa pine. The cones of Jeffrey pine are larger and more elongated, often reaching lengths of up to 12 inches. It produces edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This variant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mixed coniferous forests."
