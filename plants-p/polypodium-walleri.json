    "intro": "Polypodium walleri, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, leathery frond that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with serrated margins and a dark green, glossy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
