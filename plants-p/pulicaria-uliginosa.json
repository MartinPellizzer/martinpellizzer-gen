    "intro": "Pulicaria uliginosa, commonly known as the bog penny-cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help retain moisture. It has a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pulicaria uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supports a variety of insect life."
