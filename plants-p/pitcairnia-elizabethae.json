    "intro": "Pitcairnia elizabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
