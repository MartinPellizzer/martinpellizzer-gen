    "intro": "Passerina grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with prominent, petal-like structures called tepals. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Passerina grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
