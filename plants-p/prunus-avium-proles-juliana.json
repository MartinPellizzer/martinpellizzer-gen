    "intro": "Prunus avium proles juliana, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
