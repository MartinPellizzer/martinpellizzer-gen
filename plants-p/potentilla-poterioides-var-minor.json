    "intro": "Potentilla poterioides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its tidy habit and long bloom period."
