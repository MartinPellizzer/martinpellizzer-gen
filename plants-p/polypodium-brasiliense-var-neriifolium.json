    "intro": "Polypodium brasiliense var. neriifolium, commonly known as the black-leaf huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
