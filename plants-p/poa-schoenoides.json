    "intro": "Poa schoenoides, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Poa schoenoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
