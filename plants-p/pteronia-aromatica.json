    "intro": "Pteronia aromatica, commonly known as the sweet geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from autumn to spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Pteronia aromatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and ease of care."
