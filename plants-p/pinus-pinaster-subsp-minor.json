    "intro": "Pinus pinaster subsp. minor, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical *Pinus pinaster*. The cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in coastal or mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean forests and woodlands."
