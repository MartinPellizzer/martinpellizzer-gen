    "intro": "Pleioblastus distichus f. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clumping bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that are typically no taller than 1 meter, making it ideal for small spaces or rock gardens. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and low-maintenance qualities."
