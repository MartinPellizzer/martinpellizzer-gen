It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
