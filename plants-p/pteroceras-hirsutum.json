    "intro": "Pteroceras hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Pteroceras hirsutum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
