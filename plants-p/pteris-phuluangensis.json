    "intro": "Pteris phuluangensis, commonly known as the Thai water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris phuluangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
