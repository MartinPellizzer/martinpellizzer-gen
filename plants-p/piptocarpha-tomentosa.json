    "intro": "Piptocarpha tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bluebunch grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Piptocarpha tomentosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
