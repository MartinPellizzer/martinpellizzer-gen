It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure supports its role as an epiphytic or terrestrial species, adapting to various moisture conditions."
