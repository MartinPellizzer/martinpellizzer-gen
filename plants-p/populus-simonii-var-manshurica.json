It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is valued for its rapid growth and ornamental qualities in landscaping."
