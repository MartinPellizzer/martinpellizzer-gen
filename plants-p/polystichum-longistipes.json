    "intro": "Polystichum longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with a feathery, lanceolate shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Polystichum longistipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, dense foliage."
