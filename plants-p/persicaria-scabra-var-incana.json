    "intro": "Persicaria scabra var. incana, commonly known as rough knotgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, rough texture. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a wavy margin and a hairy surface, and they often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands."
