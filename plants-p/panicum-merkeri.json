    "intro": "Panicum merkeri, commonly known as the Merker's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-brown flowers. Its growth habit is often clump-forming, and it is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
