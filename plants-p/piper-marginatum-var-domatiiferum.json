    "intro": "Piper marginatum var. domatiiferum, commonly known as the domatiferum pepper plant, is a variant of the black pepper species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive domatium, a small, fleshy structure at the base of the fruit, which serves as a shelter for ants. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a pungent aroma. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in traditional medicine."
