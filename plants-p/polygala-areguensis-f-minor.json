    "intro": "Polygala areguensis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf polygala, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
