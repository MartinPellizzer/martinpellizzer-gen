    "intro": "Polypodium diversum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium diversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
