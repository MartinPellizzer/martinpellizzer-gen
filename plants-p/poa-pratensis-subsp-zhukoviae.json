    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. zhukoviae, commonly known as Zhukov's meadow grass, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the common meadow grass. It is native to specific regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. This grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered plant."
