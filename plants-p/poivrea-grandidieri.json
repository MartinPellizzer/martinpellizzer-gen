    "intro": "Poivrea grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar cinnamon tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
