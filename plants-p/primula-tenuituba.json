    "intro": "Primula tenuituba, commonly known as the slender tube primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, tubular leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Primula tenuituba is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
