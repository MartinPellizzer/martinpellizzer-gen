    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana subsp. silesiaca, commonly known as the Silesian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features small, palmately divided leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions."
