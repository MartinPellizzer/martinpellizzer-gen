    "intro": "Peucedanum watsonii, commonly known as the Chinese cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to regions of China and is often found in moist, temperate habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Peucedanum watsonii is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though further research is needed to validate its efficacy."
