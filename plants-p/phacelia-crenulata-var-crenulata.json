It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a serrated or wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
