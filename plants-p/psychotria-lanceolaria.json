    "intro": "Psychotria lanceolaria, commonly known as the Amazonian evergreen or the yellow psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Psychotria lanceolaria is also noted for its potential pharmacological properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and therapeutic significance."
