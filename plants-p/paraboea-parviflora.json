    "intro": "Paraboea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
