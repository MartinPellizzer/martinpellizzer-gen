    "intro": "Pavetta pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Pavetta pygmaea is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
