    "intro": "Packera millefolium, commonly known as the common rockfoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Packera millefolium is adapted to harsh conditions and is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
