    "intro": "Passiflora keri, commonly known as the Keri passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a mix of blue, purple, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits similar to other passionfruits, though it is less commonly cultivated. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a rough texture. Passiflora keri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
