    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's holly fern, is a hybrid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance that gives it its common name."
