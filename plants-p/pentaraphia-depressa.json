    "intro": "Pentaraphia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees. It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, capsule-like fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth is often restricted to the upper branches of its host, where it forms dense clusters. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken the host tree over time."
