    "intro": "Polypodium sculpturatum, commonly known as the sculptured fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with distinctive, sculpted patterns on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
