    "intro": "Plantago virescens, commonly known as green plantain or narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and healing properties. Botanically, it belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
