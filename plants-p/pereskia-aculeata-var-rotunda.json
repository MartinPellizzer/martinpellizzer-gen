    "intro": "Pereskia aculeata var. rotunda, commonly known as the velvet cactus or round-leaved cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and somewhat woody stems that are covered in a velvety, grayish-green coating. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are rounded and often fall off as the plant matures, giving it a more shrub-like appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
