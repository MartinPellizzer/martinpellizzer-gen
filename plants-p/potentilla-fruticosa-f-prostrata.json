    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in dense white or gray hairs, providing a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in rocky or coastal gardens."
