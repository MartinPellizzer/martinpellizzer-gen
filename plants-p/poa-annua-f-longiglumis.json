    "intro": "Poa annua f. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume annual bluegrass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species. It is characterized by its elongated glumes, which are the bracts at the base of the florets, giving it a distinct appearance. This plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
