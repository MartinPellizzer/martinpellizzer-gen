    "intro": "Polystichum imbricans, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely arranged and shield-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Polystichum imbricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
