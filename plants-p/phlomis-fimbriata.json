    "intro": "Phlomis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a tall, erect stem covered with soft, woolly hairs, and lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for respiratory ailments, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal."
