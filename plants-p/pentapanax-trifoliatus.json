    "intro": "Pentapanax trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved aralia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
