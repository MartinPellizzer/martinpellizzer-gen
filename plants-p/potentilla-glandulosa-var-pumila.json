    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
