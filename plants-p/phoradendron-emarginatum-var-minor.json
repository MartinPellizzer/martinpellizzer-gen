    "intro": "Phoradendron emarginatum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to the host. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is part of a complex ecological relationship with its host, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
