    "intro": "Pteris longifolia var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
