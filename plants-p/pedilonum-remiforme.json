    "intro": "Pedilonum remiforme, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short summer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Pedilonum remiforme is considered a rare and endangered species."
