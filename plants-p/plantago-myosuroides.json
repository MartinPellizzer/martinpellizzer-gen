    "intro": "Plantago myosuroides, commonly known as the mouse-ear plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of heart-shaped, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
