    "intro": "Pilocereus \u00d7 crenatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species resulting from the cross between *Pilocereus gibbsii* and *Schlumbergera truncata*. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful, fleshy top (the \"skirt\") and a green, stem-like base (the \"trunk\") that provides support. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
