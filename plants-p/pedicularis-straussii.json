    "intro": "Pedicularis straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas of Austria, Italy, and Switzerland. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
