    "intro": "Ptelea rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombifoliate sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves and small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
