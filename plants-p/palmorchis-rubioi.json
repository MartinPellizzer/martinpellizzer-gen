    "intro": "Palmorchis rubioi, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers with intricate patterns, often blooming in clusters. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
