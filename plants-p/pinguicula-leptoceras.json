    "intro": "Pinguicula leptoceras, commonly known as the slender-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually white or pink and bloom during the summer months. Pinguicula leptoceras is well adapted to its habitat, using its specialized leaves to supplement its nutrient intake."
