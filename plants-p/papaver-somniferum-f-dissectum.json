    "intro": "Papaver somniferum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected opium poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. This cultivar is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its striking, delicate foliage rather than for its medicinal or narcotic properties. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. However, due to its relation to the opium poppy, it is subject to legal restrictions in many regions."
