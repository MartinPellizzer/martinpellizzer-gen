    "intro": "Parathelypteris nigrescens, commonly known as the blackening shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often develop a reddish or blackish hue when dry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are pinnate with a distinctive, shield-like shape, contributing to its common name."
