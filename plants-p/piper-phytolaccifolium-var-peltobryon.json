It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elliptical, red berries that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. This variant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional cuisine and medicine."
