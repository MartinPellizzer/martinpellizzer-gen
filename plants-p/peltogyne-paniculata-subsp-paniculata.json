    "intro": "Peltogyne paniculata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. This species is important in both ecological and economic contexts due to its timber value and role in forest ecosystems."
