It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
