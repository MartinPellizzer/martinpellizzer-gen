    "intro": "Pelargonium exsul, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has fleshy, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pelargonium exsul is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
