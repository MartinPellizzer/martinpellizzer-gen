    "intro": "Potamogeton acutifolius f. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and lakes."
