    "intro": "Pronephrium peramalense, commonly known as the Peramalense bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are used for gas exchange and buoyancy in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological roles."
