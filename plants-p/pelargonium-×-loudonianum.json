    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 loudonianum, commonly known as the Siam Begonia, is a hybrid plant originating from crosses between Pelargonium hortorum and Pelargonium \u00d7 inerme. It is characterized by its striking, large, and colorful flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive double-petaled structure. The plant has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped and varies in color from deep green to variegated patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
