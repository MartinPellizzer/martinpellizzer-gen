    "intro": "Polypodium hemionitis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium hemionitis is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
