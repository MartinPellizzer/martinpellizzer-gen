    "intro": "Polystichum gymnocarpium, commonly known as the naked-seeded wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's name refers to the absence of a protective covering on its spores, a distinguishing feature in its reproductive biology."
