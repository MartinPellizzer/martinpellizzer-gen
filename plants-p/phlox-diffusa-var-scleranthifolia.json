It features showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats and thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for ornamental landscaping."
