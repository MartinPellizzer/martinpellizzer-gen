    "intro": "Panicum neesii, commonly known as the Nees panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and savannas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-like structures that bear the flowers. Panicum neesii is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
