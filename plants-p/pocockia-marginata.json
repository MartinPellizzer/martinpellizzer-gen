    "intro": "Pocockia marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive margin that is finely toothed or lobed. Pocockia marginata is a relatively small fern, reaching only a few centimeters in height, and is often found in association with other moisture-loving fern species."
