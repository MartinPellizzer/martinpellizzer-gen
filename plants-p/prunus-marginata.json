    "intro": "Prunus marginata, commonly known as the coastal cherry or the pink-flowered cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western coast of the United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it thrives in coastal climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and the fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that ripens in late summer. Prunus marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds."
