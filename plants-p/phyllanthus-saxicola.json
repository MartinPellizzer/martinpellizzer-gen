    "intro": "Phyllanthus saxicola, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically succulent to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Phyllanthus saxicola is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy species often found in rocky or sandy soils."
