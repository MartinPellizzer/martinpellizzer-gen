    "intro": "Prosopis kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Prosopis kuntzei plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat in its native ecosystems."
