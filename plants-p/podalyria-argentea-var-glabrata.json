    "intro": "Podalyria argentea var. glabrata, commonly known as silver-haired podalyria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
