    "intro": "Pitcairnia killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for nourishment. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant purple and red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically broad and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Pitcairnia killipiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
