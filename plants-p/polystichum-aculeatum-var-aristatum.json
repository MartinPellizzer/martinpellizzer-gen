    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features feather-like fronds that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, upright growth habit. The fronds are characterized by their sharply toothed margins and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
