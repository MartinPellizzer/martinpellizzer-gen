    "intro": "Porrum capitatum, commonly known as the globe artichoke, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of broad, spiny leaves that form a dense, shield-like structure around the central stem. The plant produces a large, edible flower head composed of tightly packed, fleshy bracts that resemble leaves. These bracts are harvested before they fully open to ensure optimal flavor and texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool climate for optimal growth."
