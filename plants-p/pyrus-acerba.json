    "intro": "Pyrus acerba, commonly known as the rock pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are typically edible but have a sharp, tart flavor. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Pyrus acerba is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
