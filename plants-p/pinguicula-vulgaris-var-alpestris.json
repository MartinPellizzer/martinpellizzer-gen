    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It produces small, white or greenish flowers during the summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
