    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its striking red-orange petals and a distinctive black, rounded seed capsule. This subspecies is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant is annual, with a short life cycle that includes flowering and seed production within a single growing season. Its morphology and coloration make it easily distinguishable from other papaver species."
