    "intro": "Paris axialis, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Paris axialis is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in temperate regions."
