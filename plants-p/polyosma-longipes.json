    "intro": "Polyosma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed polyosma, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
