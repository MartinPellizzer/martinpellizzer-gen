    "intro": "Premna trichostoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Verbenaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny white or greenish flowers, followed by small, three-lobed berries. Premna trichostoma is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges, and it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
