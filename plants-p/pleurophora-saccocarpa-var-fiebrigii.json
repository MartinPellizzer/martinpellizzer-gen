It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble bladders. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves with a hairy texture.

This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
