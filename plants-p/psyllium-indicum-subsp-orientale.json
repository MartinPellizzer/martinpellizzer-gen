    "intro": "Psyllium indicum subsp. orientale, commonly known as Indian psyllium or isabgol, is a flowering plant in the plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It is native to regions of southern and eastern Asia, including India, Pakistan, and parts of the Middle East. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain fine, mucilaginous seeds, which are widely used in traditional medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement. These seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which can absorb water and form a gel-like substance when mixed with liquid. The botanical features of this species include its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and showy, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer."
