It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades with a bluish-green color. The plant produces inflorescences that are spike-like, with elongated peduncles that give it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along water bodies. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping."
