It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis quaternaria is often found growing epiphytically on trees, contributing to the rich biodiversity of tropical rainforests."
