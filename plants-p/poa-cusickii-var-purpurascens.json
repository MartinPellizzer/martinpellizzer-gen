    "intro": "Poa cusickii var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, slightly reddish stems that often display a purplish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
