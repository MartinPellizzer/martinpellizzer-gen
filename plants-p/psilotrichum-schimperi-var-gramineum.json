    "intro": "Psilotrichum schimperi var. gramineum, commonly known as the slender psilotrichum, is a rare and diminutive fern-like plant native to specific regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, grass-like foliage and lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
