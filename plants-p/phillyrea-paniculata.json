    "intro": "Phillyrea paniculata, commonly known as the common Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Phillyrea paniculata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
