    "intro": "Pharbitis villosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
