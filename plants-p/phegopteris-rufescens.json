    "intro": "Phegopteris rufescens, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces spores in spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the undersides of its leaves. Its leaves are usually dark green with a reddish-brown hue on the underside, giving it its common name. Phegopteris rufescens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
