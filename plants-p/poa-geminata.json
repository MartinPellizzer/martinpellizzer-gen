    "intro": "Poa geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-ranked flowers. Poa geminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in ecological restoration projects."
