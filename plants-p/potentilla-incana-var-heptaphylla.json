    "intro": "Potentilla incana var. heptaphylla, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
