    "intro": "Petrosedum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively low maintenance and suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
