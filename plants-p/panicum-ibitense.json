    "intro": "Panicum ibitense, commonly known as the Ibitense grass, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
