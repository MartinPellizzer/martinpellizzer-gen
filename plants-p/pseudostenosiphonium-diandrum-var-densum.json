    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium diandrum var. densum, commonly known as the dense-flowered stenosiphon, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane or subalpine regions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
