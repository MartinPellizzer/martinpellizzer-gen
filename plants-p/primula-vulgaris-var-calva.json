    "intro": "Primula vulgaris var. calva, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is well adapted to cool, temperate climates. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature that helps in identifying this variety."
