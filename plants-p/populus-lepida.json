    "intro": "Populus lepida, commonly known as the wooly poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Populus lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
