    "intro": "Polygala panamensis, commonly known as the Panama milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind. Polygala panamensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
