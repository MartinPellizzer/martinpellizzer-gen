It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with five leaflets per leaf, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
