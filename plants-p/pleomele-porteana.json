    "intro": "Pleomele porteana, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a striking, architectural appearance. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears a single, cone-like inflorescence, which is typically green or yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists."
