    "intro": "Persica duplex, commonly known as the double peach. This unique plant is a hybrid species combining features of the peach (Prunus persica) and the almond (Prunus dulcis). It is characterized by its double-flowered blooms, which consist of two layers of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical peaches. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
