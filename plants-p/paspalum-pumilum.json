    "intro": "Paspalum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for erosion control in arid regions. Its compact size and hardiness make it a valuable plant for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
