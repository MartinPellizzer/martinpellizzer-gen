    "intro": "Phaulopsis oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaf phaulopsis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with opposite leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
