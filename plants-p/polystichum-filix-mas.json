    "intro": "Polystichum filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The male fern is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
