    "intro": "Prunus insititia convar. italica, commonly known as the Italian blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye, though they are generally toxic when raw."
