    "intro": "Polycarpaea teneriffae var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved Teneriffe polycarpaea, is a rare endemic plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, an adaptation to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
