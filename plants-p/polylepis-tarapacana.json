    "intro": "Polylepis tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a unique species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in southern Peru and northern Chile. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in the arid and cold environments it inhabits. This tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a dense, rounded crown that provides habitat for various bird and mammal species. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, though it is now classified as endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its native region, supporting biodiversity and contributing to soil stability."
