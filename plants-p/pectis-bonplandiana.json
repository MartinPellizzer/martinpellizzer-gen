    "intro": "Pectis bonplandiana, commonly known as the Bonpland's pectis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its arid environment, with reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
