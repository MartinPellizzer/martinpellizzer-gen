    "intro": "Paraboea multiflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in clusters during the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Paraboea multiflora is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
