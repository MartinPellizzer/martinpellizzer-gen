    "intro": "Poinsettia ignescens, commonly known as the flame poinsettia, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble petals, and its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its foliage is typically dark green with a glossy texture, complementing the bold colors of its bracts. Poinsettia ignescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season."
