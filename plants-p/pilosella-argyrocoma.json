    "intro": "Pilosella argyrocoma, commonly known as silverleaf haircup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features dense, silver-white hairs covering its foliage, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the daisy family. Pilosella argyrocoma thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
