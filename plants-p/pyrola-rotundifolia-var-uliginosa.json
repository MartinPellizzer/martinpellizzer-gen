    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog pink or narrow-leaf pyrola, is a flowering plant native to moist, acidic habitats in northern regions. It is characterized by its small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has oval, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in shaded, peaty soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Pyrola rotundifolia."
