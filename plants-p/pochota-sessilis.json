    "intro": "Pochota sessilis, commonly known as the Mexican coffee tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark purple to black berries containing one or two seeds. Pochota sessilis is known for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a substitute for coffee in some regions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
