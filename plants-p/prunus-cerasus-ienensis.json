It is characterized by its small, sweet, and often juicy fruits that are typically consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The Ienensian cherry is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
