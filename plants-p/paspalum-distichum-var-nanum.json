    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
