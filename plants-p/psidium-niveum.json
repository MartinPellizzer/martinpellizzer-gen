    "intro": "Psidium niveum, commonly known as the white guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered together, followed by edible, white, fleshy fruits. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and is primarily found in its native habitat."
