    "intro": "Poa annua var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are shorter than those of the typical Poa annua. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in turfgrass settings."
