    "intro": "Phaeocephalum fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered phaeocephalum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally used in native plant gardens."
