    "intro": "Pedilonum platygastrium, commonly known as the broad-gastric pedilonum, is a rare and specialized flowering plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Pedilonaceae and is characterized by its unique, flattened, leaf-like structures that serve as modified stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth is closely tied to nutrient-rich, well-drained soils in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
