    "intro": "Phlox hoodii var. canescens, commonly known as the gray phlox, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
