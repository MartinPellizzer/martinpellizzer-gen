    "intro": "Piper areolatum, commonly known as the areola pepper or the horned pepper, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. The botanical features of Piper areolatum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ornamental gardening."
