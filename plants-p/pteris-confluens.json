    "intro": "Pteris confluens, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris confluens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
