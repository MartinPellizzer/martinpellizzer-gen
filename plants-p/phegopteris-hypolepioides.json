    "intro": "Phegopteris hypolepioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats."
