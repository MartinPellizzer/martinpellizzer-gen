    "intro": "Polypodium parvum, commonly known as the small fern or the common polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Polypodium parvum is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
