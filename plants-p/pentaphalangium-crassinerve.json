It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent, broad veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are covered in fine hairs and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
