    "intro": "Primula platycrana, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a notable early-flowering species. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is relatively rare in the wild."
