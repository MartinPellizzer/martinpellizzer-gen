    "intro": "Pilosella jodolepis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Pilosella jodolepis has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. It is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
