    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. Pseudognaphalium oxyphyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
