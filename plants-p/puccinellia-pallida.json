    "intro": "Puccinellia pallida, commonly known as slender puccinellia, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in saline and alkaline soils. It is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in coastal areas and inland salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in saline habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
