    "intro": "Phoradendron rehderianum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its life cycle involves both asexual reproduction through vegetative growth and sexual reproduction via seeds. This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, influencing host tree health and supporting wildlife."
