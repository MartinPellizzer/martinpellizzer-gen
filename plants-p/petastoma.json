    "intro": "Petastoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Petastoma is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
