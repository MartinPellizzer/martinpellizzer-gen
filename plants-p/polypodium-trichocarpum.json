    "intro": "Polypodium trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds with a hairy underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones."
