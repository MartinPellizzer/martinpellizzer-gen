    "intro": "Phegopteris divergens, commonly known as the eastern sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 90 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of the fronds. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
