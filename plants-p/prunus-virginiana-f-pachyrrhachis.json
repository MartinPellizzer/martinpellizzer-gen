It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and is native to parts of North America. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
