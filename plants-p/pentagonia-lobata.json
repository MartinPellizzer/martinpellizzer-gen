    "intro": "Pentagonia lobata, commonly known as the five-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and distinctive five-lobed leaves. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. Pentagonia lobata is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to most animals but serves as a defense mechanism. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
