    "intro": "Phegopteris ornata, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize moist, shaded habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Phegopteris ornata thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments where it can access the moisture it requires for growth."
