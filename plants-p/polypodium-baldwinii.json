    "intro": "Polypodium baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure around the plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
