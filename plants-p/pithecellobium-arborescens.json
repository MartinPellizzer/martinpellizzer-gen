    "intro": "Pithecellobium arborescens, commonly known as the tree legume or golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
