    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. oxyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, usually greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy, contributing to its adaptation to arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
