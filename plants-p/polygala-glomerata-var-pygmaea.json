    "intro": "Polygala glomerata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed or pygmy milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the Polygala genus. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique floral structure and compact growth habit make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native plant gardens."
