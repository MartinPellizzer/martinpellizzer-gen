    "intro": "Psilolepus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracteate psilolepus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
