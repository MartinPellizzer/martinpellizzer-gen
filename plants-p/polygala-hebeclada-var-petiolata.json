    "intro": "Polygala hebeclada var. petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
