    "intro": "Polypodium simplex var. esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common polypody fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. It has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
