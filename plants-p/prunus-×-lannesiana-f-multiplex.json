    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. multiplex, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus lannesiana and other Prunus species, leading to its distinctive floral morphology. The plant is known for its profuse, double blooms, which consist of multiple layers of petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with deciduous foliage that turns vibrant shades of red or yellow in autumn. The botanical features of this plant make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and horticultural displays."
