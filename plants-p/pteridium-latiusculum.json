    "intro": "Pteridium latiusculum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its successful propagation and ecological dominance."
