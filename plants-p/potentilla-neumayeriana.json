    "intro": "Potentilla neumayeriana, commonly known as the Neumayer's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
