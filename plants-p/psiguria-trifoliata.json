    "intro": "Psiguria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss. Psiguria trifoliata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
