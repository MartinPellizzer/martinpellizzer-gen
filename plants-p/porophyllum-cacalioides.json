It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with white centers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils and sesquiterpene lactones. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a source of nectar for pollinators and as a component of local ecosystems."
