    "intro": "Pilea maculata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with creamy or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea maculata is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated easily through stem cuttings."
