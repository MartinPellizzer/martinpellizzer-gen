    "intro": "Polytaenium urbani, commonly known as the urban spurge, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in urban environments. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some areas but also has ecological value in supporting local insect populations."
