    "intro": "Peperomia versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that display a striking range of colors, including shades of green, red, and purple, depending on light exposure. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically white or green, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia versicolor is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
