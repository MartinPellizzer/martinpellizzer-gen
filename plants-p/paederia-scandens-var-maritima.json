    "intro": "Paederia scandens var. maritima, commonly known as coastal paederia, is a climbing vine native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy and adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is often found in tidal zones. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
