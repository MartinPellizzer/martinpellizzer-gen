It features dense, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brown, leathery scales. Polystichum speciosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
