    "intro": "Phaca reventa subsp. canbyi, commonly known as the Canby's phaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
