    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata f. alba, commonly known as the white lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
