    "intro": "Polypodium paleaceum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium paleaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
