    "intro": "Pultenaea selaginoides, commonly known as the silver-leaf pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Pultenaea selaginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
