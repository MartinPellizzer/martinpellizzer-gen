    "intro": "Polypodium montense, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Polypodium montense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
