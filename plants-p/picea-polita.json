    "intro": "Picea polita, commonly known as the smooth white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive smooth, white bark that becomes flaky with age. The tree produces small, cone-like seed structures that mature in the second year, releasing winged seeds for wind dispersal. Its needle-like leaves are short, flat, and have a silvery-blue appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Picea polita is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and subarctic regions."
