    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact variety of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its low, cushion-like growth habit, with short, dense branches and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically 2\u20134 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
