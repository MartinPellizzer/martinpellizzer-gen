    "intro": "Prunus virens, commonly known as the green cherry or green almond, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black bark and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in traditional medicine. Prunus virens thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and early blooming habit."
