    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum riparium, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in environments with high humidity. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake, and it is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
