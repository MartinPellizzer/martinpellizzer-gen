    "intro": "Pyrethrum ferulaceum, commonly known as the narrowleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic insecticides. Pyrethrum ferulaceum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and commercial cultivation."
