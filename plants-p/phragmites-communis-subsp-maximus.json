    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. maximus, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, tall stalks that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes at the top of its stems. It is highly adaptable and can grow in a variety of moist soils, including those in marshes, ditches, and lake shores. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
