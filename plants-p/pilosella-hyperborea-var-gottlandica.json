    "intro": "Pilosella hyperborea var. gottlandica, commonly known as the Gottland hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, displaying a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the nominate species."
