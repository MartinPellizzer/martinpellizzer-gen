It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by black, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting this species."
