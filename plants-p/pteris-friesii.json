    "intro": "Pteris friesii, commonly known as the Fries' water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in moist forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris friesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
