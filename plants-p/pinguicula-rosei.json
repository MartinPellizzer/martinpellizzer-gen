    "intro": "Pinguicula rosei, commonly known as the rose leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Pinguicula rosei is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
