    "intro": "Phyllanthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Phyllanthus rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
