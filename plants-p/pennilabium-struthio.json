    "intro": "Pennilabium struthio, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, sweet scent. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Pennilabium struthio is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
