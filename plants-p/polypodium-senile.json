It is characterized by its long, hanging rhizomes that bear clusters of small, bright green fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Polypodium senile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
