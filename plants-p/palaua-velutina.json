    "intro": "Palaua velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Palaua velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
