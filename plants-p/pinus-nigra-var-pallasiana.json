    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. This resilient evergreen is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and charcoal production."
