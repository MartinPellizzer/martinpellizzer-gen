It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
