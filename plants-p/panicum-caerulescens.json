    "intro": "Panicum caerulescens, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced under full sun. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that range in color from silver to blue, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Panicum caerulescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
