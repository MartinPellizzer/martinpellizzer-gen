    "intro": "Pleione diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its unique two-leaf structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip petal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
