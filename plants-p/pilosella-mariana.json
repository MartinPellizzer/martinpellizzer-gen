    "intro": "Pilosella mariana, commonly known as the Canadian mountain bluet, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its small blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella mariana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
