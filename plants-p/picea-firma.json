    "intro": "Picea firma, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea firma thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and paper production."
