    "intro": "Panicum paucifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for other panic grasses. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant plant suitable for native landscapes."
