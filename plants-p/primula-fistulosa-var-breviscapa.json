It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
