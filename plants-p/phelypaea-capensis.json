    "intro": "Phelypaea capensis, commonly known as the Cape liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a unique structure with closely packed leaves that form a cushion-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Phelypaea capensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native range."
