    "intro": "Pontederia maculata, commonly known as the purple rush or water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features striking purple flowers that bloom in dense spikes, often emerging from water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in wetland environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ecological resource and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
