    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. collina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for high-altitude environments. This plant typically thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rugged terrain. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting alpine biodiversity."
