    "intro": "Pilosella austerula, commonly known as the common hawk's beard, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pilosella austerula is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects."
