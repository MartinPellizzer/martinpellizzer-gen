It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
