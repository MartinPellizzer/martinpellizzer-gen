    "intro": "Peperomia polochicana, commonly known as the Polochicana pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that are often green with reddish veins. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Peperomia polochicana prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
