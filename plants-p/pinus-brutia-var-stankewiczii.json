    "intro": "Pinus brutia var. stankewiczii, commonly known as the Stankewicz pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the Aleppo pine. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and conical shape. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that set it apart from other pine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
