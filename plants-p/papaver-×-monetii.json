    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 monetii, commonly known as the Flanders poppy, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas and Papaver acanthocarpum. It is characterized by its striking red petals with a black center, which are typically 5 to 7 cm in diameter. The plant is native to the low-lying areas of the Netherlands and Belgium, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a profusion of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also notable for its historical association with World War I, as it was a common sight in the battlefields of the Western Front."
