    "intro": "Plantago lasiothrix, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The hairy plantain is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
