    "intro": "Polystichum kalambatitrense, commonly known as the Kalambatitre fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
