    "intro": "Phytocrene dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited phytocrene, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruit is unique, being a dry, hairy capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Phytocrene dasycarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
