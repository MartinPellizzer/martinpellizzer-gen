    "intro": "Piptatherum hilariae, commonly known as the Hilaria grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Piptatherum hilariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
