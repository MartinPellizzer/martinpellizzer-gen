It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Psiadia altissima."
