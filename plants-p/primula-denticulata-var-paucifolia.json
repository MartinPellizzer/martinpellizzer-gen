    "intro": "Primula denticulata var. paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, ovate leaves with a distinctive denticulate margin. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
