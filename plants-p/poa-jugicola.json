    "intro": "Poa jugicola, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa jugicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its durability and adaptability."
