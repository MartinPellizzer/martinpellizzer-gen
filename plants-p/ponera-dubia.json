    "intro": "Ponera dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with elongated leaves and a single, pale green or white flower that lacks petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Ponera dubia is considered a conservation concern."
