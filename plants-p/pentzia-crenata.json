    "intro": "Pentzia crenata, commonly known as the coastal pincushion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
