    "intro": "Polygala pterocarya, commonly known as the winged milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has feathery leaves and produces pods that contain seeds with a distinctive wing-like structure. It is well adapted to dry environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Polygala pterocarya is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
