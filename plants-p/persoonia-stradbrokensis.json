    "intro": "Persoonia stradbrokensis, commonly known as the Stradbroke Island Persoonia, is an endemic species native to Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant features small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Persoonia stradbrokensis is valued for its ecological role and is also a subject of botanical study due to its unique adaptations."
