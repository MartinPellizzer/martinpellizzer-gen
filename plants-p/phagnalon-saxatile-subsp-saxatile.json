    "intro": "Phagnalon saxatile subsp. saxatile, commonly known as the saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water in dry soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
