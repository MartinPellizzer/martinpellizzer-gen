It is characterized by its silvery-gray, scale-like leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Phylica stipularis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
