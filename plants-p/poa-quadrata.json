    "intro": "Poa quadrata, commonly known as the squaregrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive square-shaped stem nodes, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Poa quadrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
