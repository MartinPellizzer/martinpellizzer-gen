It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
