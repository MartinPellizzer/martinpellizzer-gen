    "intro": "Prunus lucens, commonly known as the white cherry or Japanese white cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white-pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its fruit is a small, sweet drupe that ripens in late summer. Prunus lucens is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for."
