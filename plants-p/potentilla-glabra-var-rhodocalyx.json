    "intro": "Potentilla glabra var. rhodocalyx, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, arching stems covered in soft, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosted appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
