    "intro": "Pleopeltis curtisii, commonly known as Curtis's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks and rocky surfaces. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its delicate, spore-bearing structures are typically found on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
