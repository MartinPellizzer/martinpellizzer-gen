    "intro": "Pteris heterogena, commonly known as the heterogenous water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to damp soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and potential health benefits."
