    "intro": "Parrya longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited parrya, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Parrya longicarpa is adapted to drought conditions and plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
