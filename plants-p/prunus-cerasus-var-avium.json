It produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. Its fruit is a drupe, typically red to dark red when mature, containing a single seed. The sweet cherry is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
