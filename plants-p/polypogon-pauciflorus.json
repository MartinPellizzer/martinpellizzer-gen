    "intro": "Polypogon pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Polypogon pauciflorus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
