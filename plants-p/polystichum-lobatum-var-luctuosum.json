    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. luctuosum, commonly known as the weeping wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its drooping fronds. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore production. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ornamental value comes from the elegant, cascading appearance of its foliage."
