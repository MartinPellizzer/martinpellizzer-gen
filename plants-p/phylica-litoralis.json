    "intro": "Phylica litoralis, commonly known as the coastal phylica, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that are arranged in dense spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Phylica litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
