    "intro": "Pinus juarezensis, commonly known as the Ju\u00e1rez pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
