    "intro": "Pedicularis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its flowers are usually red or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
