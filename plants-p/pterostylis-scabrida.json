    "intro": "Pterostylis scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leafed greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, erect stem with a few narrow, dark green leaves. Its distinctive flower is green with a hood-like structure, and it has a short, narrow spur. Pterostylis scabrida is pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral morphology."
