It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, lens-shaped seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
