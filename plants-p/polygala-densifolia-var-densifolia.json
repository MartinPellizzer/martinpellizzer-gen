    "intro": "Polygala densifolia var. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Polygala genus. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
