    "intro": "Prunus insititia subsp. turonensis, commonly known as the Turk's turpentine or Turonian cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Central Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red or black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its thin, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The berries are used in traditional medicine and are also a food source for birds and small mammals."
