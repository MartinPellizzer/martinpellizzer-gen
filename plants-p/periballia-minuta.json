It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
