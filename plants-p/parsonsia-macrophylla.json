    "intro": "Parsonsia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf parsonsia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, broad ovate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Parsonsia macrophylla is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
