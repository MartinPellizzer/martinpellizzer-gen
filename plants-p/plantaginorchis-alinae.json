    "intro": "Plantaginorchis alinae, commonly known as the Alina's plantain orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly through its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
