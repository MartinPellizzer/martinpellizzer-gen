    "intro": "Prinos coriaceus, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Prinos coriaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
