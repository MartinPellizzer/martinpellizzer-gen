    "intro": "Poa refracta, commonly known as the refractable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and sterile florets, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Poa refracta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecological systems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
