It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
