    "intro": "Plantago major var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties and ecological benefits."
