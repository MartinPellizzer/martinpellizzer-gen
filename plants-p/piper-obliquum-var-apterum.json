    "intro": "Piper obliquum var. apterum, commonly known as the winged pepper or winged variety of black pepper, is a variant of the black pepper plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on the fruit pedicels, which are absent in the standard variety. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruits, which mature to a dark red or black color, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The botanical features of this variety make it unique within the Piper genus, particularly in its morphological adaptations."
