    "intro": "Polypodium hymenodes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypody that thrives in rocky, humid environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and prefers shaded, moist habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
