    "intro": "Polygonum hastatum, commonly known as the arrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along its square, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist soils along roadsides or in meadows. Polygonum hastatum is known for its adaptability and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
