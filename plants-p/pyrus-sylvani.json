    "intro": "Pyrus sylvani, commonly known as the alpine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Pyrus sylvani is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
