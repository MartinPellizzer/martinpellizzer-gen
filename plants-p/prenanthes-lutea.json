    "intro": "Prenanthes lutea, commonly known as yellow water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in wet, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. However, it is toxic and should be avoided, as all parts of the plant contain harmful compounds."
