    "intro": "Plectranthus albicalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered plectranthus, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant properties. Plectranthus albicalyx is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic uses."
