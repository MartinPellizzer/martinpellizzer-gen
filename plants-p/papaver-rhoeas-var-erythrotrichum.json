    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. erythrotrichum, commonly known as the scarlet poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its vivid red flowers. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces showy, cup-shaped blooms with a central stigma that is often darker in color. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, and it is known for its short growing season. The variety erythrotrichum is distinguished by its dense, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
