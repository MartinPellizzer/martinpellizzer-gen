    "intro": "Pteris aquilina var. pseudocaudata, commonly known as the false cobra fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble the tail of a cobra, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a serrated margin and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage."
