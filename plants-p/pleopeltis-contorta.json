    "intro": "Pleopeltis contorta, commonly known as the twisted pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a twisted or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a layer of fine, root-like structures. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows."
