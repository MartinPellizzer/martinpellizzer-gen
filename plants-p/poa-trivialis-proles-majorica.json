    "intro": "Poa trivialis proles majorica, commonly known as the greater meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
