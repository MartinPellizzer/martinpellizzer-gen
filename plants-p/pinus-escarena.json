    "intro": "Pinus escarena, commonly known as the Escarameia pine, is a species of conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Pinus escarena plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
