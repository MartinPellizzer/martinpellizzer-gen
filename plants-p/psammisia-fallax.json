    "intro": "Psammisia fallax, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Psammisia fallax is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
