    "intro": "Prunus insititia var. spinosa, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The berries are edible when ripe but can be sour and are sometimes used in jams or wines."
