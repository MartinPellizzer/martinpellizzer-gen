It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with a mix of green, white, and sometimes pinkish hues, giving it a striking visual appearance. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
