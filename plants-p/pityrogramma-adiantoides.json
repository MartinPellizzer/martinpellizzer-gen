    "intro": "Pityrogramma adiantoides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Pityrogramma adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures."
