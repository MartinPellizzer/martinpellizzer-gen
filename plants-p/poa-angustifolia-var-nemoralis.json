    "intro": "Poa angustifolia var. nemoralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals."
