    "intro": "Pterisanthes dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie pterisanthes, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features a tall, slender stem topped with a large, waxy, green spathe that encloses a spadix bearing tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered and is rarely seen in cultivation."
