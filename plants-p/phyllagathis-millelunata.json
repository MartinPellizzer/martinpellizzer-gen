It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, moss-like cluster. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in tropical botany and ecological research."
