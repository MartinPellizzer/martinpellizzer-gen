    "intro": "Pseudolmedia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pseudolmedia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that provide resistance to environmental stress. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
