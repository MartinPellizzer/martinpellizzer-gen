    "intro": "Parsonsia laevis, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has smooth, pale green bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy coating. Parsonsia laevis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
