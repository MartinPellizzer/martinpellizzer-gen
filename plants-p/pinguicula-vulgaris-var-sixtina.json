    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. sixtina, commonly known as the Sixtina butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. This variety is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor environment."
