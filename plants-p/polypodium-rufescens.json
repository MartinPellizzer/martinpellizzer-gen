    "intro": "Polypodium rufescens, commonly known as the rusty polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
