    "intro": "Pentagonia, commonly known as the five-angle plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal or five-angled leaves, which give it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble spikes or clusters. Pentagonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and South America. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
