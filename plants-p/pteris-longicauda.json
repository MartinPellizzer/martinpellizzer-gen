    "intro": "Pteris longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, giving it a distinctive, flowing appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. Pteris longicauda is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
