It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble a pleated fabric, giving it its scientific name. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
