    "intro": "Pterophylla henricorum, commonly known as the Henry's pterophylla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
