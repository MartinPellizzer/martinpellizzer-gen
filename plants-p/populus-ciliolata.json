    "intro": "Populus ciliolata, commonly known as the silky poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Populus ciliolata is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems."
