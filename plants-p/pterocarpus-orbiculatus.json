    "intro": "Pterocarpus orbiculatus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by distinctive, flat, pod-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it popular in furniture and musical instrument manufacturing. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
