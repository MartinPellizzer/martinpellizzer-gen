    "intro": "Polygala gagnebiniana, commonly known as the Gagnebin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
