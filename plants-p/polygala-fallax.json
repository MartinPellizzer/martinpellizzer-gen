It features slender, erect stems that bear small, pale green to white flowers clustered in loose spikes. The plant's leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
