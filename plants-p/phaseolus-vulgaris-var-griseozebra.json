    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. griseozebra, commonly known as the gray zebra bean, is a variant of the common bean characterized by its distinctive mottled gray and green stripes on the pod and seeds. This variety originates from Central and South America, where it has been cultivated for generations. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters, with compound leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its seeds are usually small, oblong, and have a mild, nutty flavor, making them suitable for both culinary and agricultural use. The gray zebra bean is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its nutritional content and adaptability to various growing conditions."
