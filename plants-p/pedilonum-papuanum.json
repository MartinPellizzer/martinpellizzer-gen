    "intro": "Pedilonum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan starling vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Papua. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
