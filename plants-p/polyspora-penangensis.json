    "intro": "Polyspora penangensis, commonly known as the Penang polyspora, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of Penang in Malaysia. It belongs to the family Polysporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are clustered at the base of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
