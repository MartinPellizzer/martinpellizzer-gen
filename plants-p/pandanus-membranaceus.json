    "intro": "Pandanus membranaceus, commonly known as the paper pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, woody fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
