    "intro": "Pauridiantha chlorantha, commonly known as the green-flowered pauridiantha, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical structure includes a short stem with clustered leaves and a compact inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
