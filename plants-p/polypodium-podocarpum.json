    "intro": "Polypodium podocarpum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium podocarpum is often found growing on cliffs, walls, or in crevices where it can access moisture and sunlight. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
