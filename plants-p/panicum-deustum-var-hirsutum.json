    "intro": "Panicum deustum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hirsute panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, coarse leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ornamental value is limited due to its rough texture, but it is sometimes used in erosion control."
