    "intro": "Parietaria fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's wall fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Parietaria fernandeziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
