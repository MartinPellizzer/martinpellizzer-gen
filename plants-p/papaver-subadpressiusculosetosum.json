    "intro": "Papaver subadpressiusculosetosum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes many species of poppies known for their showy, often colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, and its hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
