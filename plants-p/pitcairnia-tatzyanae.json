    "intro": "Pitcairnia tatzyanae, commonly known as the Tatziana pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by the plant for hydration. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
