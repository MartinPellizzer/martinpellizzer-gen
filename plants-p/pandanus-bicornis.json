    "intro": "Pandanus bicornis, commonly known as the double-crested pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the plant. Its fruit, called a \"pandanus fruit,\" is edible and has a sweet, fibrous texture. Pandanus bicornis is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
