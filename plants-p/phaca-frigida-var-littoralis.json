    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal phaca, is a hardy, low-growing plant adapted to harsh coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to dune stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
