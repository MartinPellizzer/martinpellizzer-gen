    "intro": "Paliurus solitarius, commonly known as the solitary paliurus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by small, red or orange fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Paliurus solitarius is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
