It is a small annual herb with hairy, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psoralea curtisiae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
