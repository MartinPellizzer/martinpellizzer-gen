    "intro": "Puya lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its distinctive look. Puya lanuginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in high-altitude, sunny environments."
