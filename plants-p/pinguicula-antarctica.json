    "intro": "Pinguicula antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica. It thrives in the cold, nutrient-poor conditions of the continent, using its sticky, glandular leaves to trap and digest small invertebrates. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete digestive enzymes, allowing it to absorb essential nutrients. It is one of the few flowering plants that survive in such harsh, icy climates. Its ability to adapt to extreme cold and limited nutrients makes it a unique example of botanical resilience."
