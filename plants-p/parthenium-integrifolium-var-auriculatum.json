    "intro": "Parthenium integrifolium var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate parthenium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an annual herb that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings."
