    "intro": "Porterandia bruneiensis, commonly known as the Brunei sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to Brunei. It is a small evergreen tree belonging to the family Myrtaceae, characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
