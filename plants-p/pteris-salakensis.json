    "intro": "Pteris salakensis, commonly known as the Salakensis water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically green and feathery in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are dispersed through the air. Pteris salakensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
