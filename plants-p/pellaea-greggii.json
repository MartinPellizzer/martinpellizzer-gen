    "intro": "Pellaea greggii, commonly known as Gregg's maidenhair, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year's growth being sterile. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study. The fronds are usually dark green and curl upwards, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
