    "intro": "Pimela altissima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. Pimela altissima plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
