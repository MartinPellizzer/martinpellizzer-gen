    "intro": "Polypodium alcicorne, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium alcicorne is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
