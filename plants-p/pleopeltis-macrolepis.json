    "intro": "Pleopeltis macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
