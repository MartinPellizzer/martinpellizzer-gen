    "intro": "Polygonum tomentosum var. eciliatum, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
