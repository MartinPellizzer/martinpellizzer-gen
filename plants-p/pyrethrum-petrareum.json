    "intro": "Pyrethrum petrareum, commonly known as the rock pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pyrethrum petrareum is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds in its flowers."
