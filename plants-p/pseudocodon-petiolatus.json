It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
