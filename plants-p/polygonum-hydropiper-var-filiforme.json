    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. filiforme, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or in shallow water. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in spikes, typically in late summer. This plant is adapted to moist or aquatic habitats and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and flooded fields."
