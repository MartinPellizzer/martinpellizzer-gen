    "intro": "Pycnocoma danguyana, commonly known as the Danguy's pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cooler climates. Its leaves are covered in dense, soft hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Pycnocoma danguyana is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
