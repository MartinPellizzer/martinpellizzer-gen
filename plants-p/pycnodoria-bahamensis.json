    "intro": "Pycnodoria bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
