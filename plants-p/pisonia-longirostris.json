    "intro": "Pisonia longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a distinct, often aromatic scent. Pisonia longirostris thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often forming dense thickets in sandy or rocky soils."
