    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 gillotana, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical studies."
