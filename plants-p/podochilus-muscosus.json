    "intro": "Podochilus muscosus, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its roots are often covered in a dense layer of mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is known for its unique floral structure and is often found in low-light conditions."
