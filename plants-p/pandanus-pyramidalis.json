    "intro": "Pandanus pyramidalis, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces striking, reddish-orange flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which are clustered at the apex of the plant. These flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant produces edible, fibrous fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses in various Pacific cultures."
