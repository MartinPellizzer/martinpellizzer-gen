It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance."
