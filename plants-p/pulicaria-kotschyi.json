    "intro": "Pulicaria kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi's cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structure. The plant features narrow, grayish-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Pulicaria kotschyi is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental potential in dry gardens."
