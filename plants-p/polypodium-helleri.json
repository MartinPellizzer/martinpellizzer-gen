    "intro": "Polypodium helleri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocky surfaces. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a feathery appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Polypodium helleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. Its ability to adapt to various substrates makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
