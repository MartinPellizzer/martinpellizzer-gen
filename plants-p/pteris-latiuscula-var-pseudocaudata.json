    "intro": "Pteris latiuscula var. pseudocaudata, commonly known as the false tail fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often arched or curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
