    "intro": "Pinnasa amabilis, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and it blooms during the dry season. Its habitat is limited to specific high-altitude environments, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Pinnasa amabilis is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
