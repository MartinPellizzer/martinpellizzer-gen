    "intro": "Psilocaulon calvinianum, commonly known as the California ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the western United States. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is notable for its unique ecological niche and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
