    "intro": "Polypodium synammia, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
