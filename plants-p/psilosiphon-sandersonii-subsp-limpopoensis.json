It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
