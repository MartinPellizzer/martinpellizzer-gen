    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi false chain fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
