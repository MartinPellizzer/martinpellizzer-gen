    "intro": "Papaver schelkovnikovii, commonly known as Schelkovnikov's poppy, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive, elongated seed pod that develops after flowering. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
