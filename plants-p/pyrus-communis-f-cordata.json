    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped pear, is a unique variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which set it apart from the typical oval leaves of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to regular pears but often smaller. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in temperate climates. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
