    "intro": "Pouteria medicata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nuts. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance includes its role in traditional medicine and its ecological importance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
