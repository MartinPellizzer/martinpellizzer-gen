    "intro": "Protium laxiflorum, commonly known as the Southeast Asian ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered white flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody shell. Due to its slow growth and durable wood, it is valued for timber and traditional uses in local communities."
