    "intro": "Prunus brassii, commonly known as the Mexican plum or desert plum, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Prunus brassii is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in southern regions."
