It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms with a distinctive, sweet scent.

Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
