    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 tuberculatum, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a cultivated species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver bracteatum (Turkestan poppy). It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive, rounded seed pod. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its botanical features include showy, papery petals and a unique, tuberculate (wart-like) surface on the seed capsule. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and historical use in medicine."
