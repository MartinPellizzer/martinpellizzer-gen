    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-green foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to the standard Douglas fir. The leaves are typically shorter and more closely pressed to the shoots, contributing to its dense, compact growth habit. This variety is often found in moist, cool environments, such as along riverbanks and in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
