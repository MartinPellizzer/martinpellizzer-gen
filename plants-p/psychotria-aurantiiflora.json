    "intro": "Psychotria aurantiiflora, commonly known as the \"orange-flowered Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded forest environments. Psychotria aurantiiflora is also notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
