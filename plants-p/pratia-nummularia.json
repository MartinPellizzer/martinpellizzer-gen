    "intro": "Pratia nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
