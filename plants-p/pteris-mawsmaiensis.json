    "intro": "Pteris mawsmaiensis, commonly known as the Mawsmai fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Pteris mawsmaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
