    "intro": "Pedicularis portenschlagii, commonly known as the Portenschlag's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
