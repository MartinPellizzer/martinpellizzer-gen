It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting local insect populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
