    "intro": "Panax angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, elongated leaves and a fleshy, yellowish root system. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, loamy soil to grow optimally. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, containing various bioactive compounds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
