It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Pteris haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
