    "intro": "Phymatosorus biseriatus, commonly known as the two-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have two prominent veins running along their length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a feature that aids in its identification."
