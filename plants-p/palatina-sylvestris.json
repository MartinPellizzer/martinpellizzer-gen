    "intro": "Palatina sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherries that ripen in summer. Its fruits are often used in culinary applications, while its wood is valued for its fine grain and workability. Palatina sylvestris also plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance."
