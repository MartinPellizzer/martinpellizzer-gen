    "intro": "Paullinia arenicola, commonly known as the coastal soursop, is a woody shrub native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, spiny fruits resembling a small, elongated citrus. Its botanical features include a robust root system adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
