    "intro": "Polypodium someyae f. awaense, commonly known as the Awa fern, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
