    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf bistort, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stout, rhizomatous rootstock and rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. Its foliage is often used in herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
