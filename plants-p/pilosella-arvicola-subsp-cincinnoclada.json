    "intro": "Pilosella arvicola subsp. cincinnoclada, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and on mountain slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
