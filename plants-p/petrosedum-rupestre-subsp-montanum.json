    "intro": "Petrosedum rupestre subsp. montanum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its habitat. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in landscaping to enhance dry, rocky landscapes."
