    "intro": "Palicourea goyazensis, commonly known as Brazilian angel's trumpet, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to its mild toxic properties. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Palicourea goyazensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic effects."
