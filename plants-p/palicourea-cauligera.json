    "intro": "Palicourea cauligera, commonly known as the cloud forest mistflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid, montane regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitat. Palicourea cauligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
