    "intro": "Pilosella nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Pilosella nevadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine insects and birds."
