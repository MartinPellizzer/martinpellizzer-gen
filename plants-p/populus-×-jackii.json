    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 jackii, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a cross between Populus nigra and Populus tremula, resulting in a species with characteristics of both parents. The plant has smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. It produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Populus \u00d7 jackii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate."
