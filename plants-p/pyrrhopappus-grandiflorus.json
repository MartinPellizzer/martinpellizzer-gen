    "intro": "Pyrrhopappus grandiflorus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pyrrhopappus grandiflorus is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
