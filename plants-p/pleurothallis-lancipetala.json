    "intro": "Pleurothallis lancipetala, commonly known as the lancipetala orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. This orchid is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it benefits from the moisture and nutrients provided by the canopy."
