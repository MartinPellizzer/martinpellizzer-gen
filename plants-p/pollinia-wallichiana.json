    "intro": "Pollinia wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen that adhere to the insect vectors during pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a complex structure that facilitates specialized pollination. Due to its habitat and rarity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
