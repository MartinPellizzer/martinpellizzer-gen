    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 hokurikuense, commonly known as the Hokuriku fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hirtum. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
