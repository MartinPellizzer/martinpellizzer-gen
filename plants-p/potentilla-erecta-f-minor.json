    "intro": "Potentilla erecta f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
