    "intro": "Pityrogramma ebenea, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Pityrogramma ebenea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
