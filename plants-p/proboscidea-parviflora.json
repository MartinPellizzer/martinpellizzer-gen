    "intro": "Proboscidea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered proboscis plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects due to their shape and color. The leaves are usually ovate and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
