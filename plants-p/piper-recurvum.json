    "intro": "Piper recurvum, commonly known as the curly pipevine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes over 2,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically black when mature. Piper recurvum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting certain species of butterflies."
