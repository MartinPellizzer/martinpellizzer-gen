    "intro": "Piper macgillivrayi var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"glabrum.\" The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves contain alkaloids, making it toxic to livestock and some animals."
