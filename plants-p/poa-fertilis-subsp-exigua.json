It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing several small, two-rowed flowers.
