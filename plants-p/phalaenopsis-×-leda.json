    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 leda, commonly known as the Orchid Hybrid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Phalaenopsis equestris and Phalaenopsis aphrodite. It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting blooms that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a waxy texture. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light. Phalaenopsis \u00d7 leda is popular in horticulture for its beauty and ease of care."
