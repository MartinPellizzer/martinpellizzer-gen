It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Pomaderris parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
