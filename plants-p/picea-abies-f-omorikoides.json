    "intro": "Picea abies f. omorikoides, commonly known as the Omorikoides fir, is a rare and distinctive form of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its unique cone morphology, with elongated and often curved cones that differ from the typical conical shape of the species. The foliage is dense and dark green, with needles that are slightly shorter and more rigid than those of the standard Norway spruce. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological adaptations."
