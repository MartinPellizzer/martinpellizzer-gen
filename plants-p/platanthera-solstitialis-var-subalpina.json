    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and is often found in association with mosses and lichens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
