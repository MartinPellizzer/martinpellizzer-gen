    "intro": "Parosela galbina, commonly known as the Galbina parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Parosela galbina is considered endangered in its native range."
