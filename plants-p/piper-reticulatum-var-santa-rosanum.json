    "intro": "Piper reticulatum var. santa-rosanum, commonly known as the Santa Rosa pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, thin fruits resembling peppers. These fruits turn red when mature and are often used in culinary applications due to their mild, peppery flavor. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
