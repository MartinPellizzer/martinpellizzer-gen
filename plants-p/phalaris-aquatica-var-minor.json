    "intro": "Phalaris aquatica var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are generally narrower than those of the typical *Phalaris aquatica*. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spikes during the summer months. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
