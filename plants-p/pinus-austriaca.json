    "intro": "Pinus austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that mature within one to two years, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, temperate climates. The Austrian pine is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
