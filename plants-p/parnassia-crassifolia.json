    "intro": "Parnassia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved parnassia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, white, cup-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Parnassia crassifolia is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
