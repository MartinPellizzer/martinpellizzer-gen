    "intro": "Premna kunstleri, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Premna kunstleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
