    "intro": "Pyracantha rogersiana f. flava, commonly known as the golden-fruited firethorn, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces orange to red berries in the fall, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fruits and dense, thorny growth habit. This cultivar is often used in hedges and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its hardiness and seasonal color changes."
