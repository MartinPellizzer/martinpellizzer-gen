    "intro": "Parnassia qinghaiensis, commonly known as the Qinghai Parnassia, is a rare alpine plant native to the Qinghai region of China. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that resemble those of the genus Parnassia. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in mountain meadows. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive veining pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
