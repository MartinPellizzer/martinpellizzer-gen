It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal floral display."
