    "intro": "Poa omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Sichuan province, where it grows in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Poa omeiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
