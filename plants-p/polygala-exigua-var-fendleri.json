    "intro": "Polygala exigua var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, often branching stems that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
