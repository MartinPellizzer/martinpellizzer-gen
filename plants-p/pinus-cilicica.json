    "intro": "Pinus cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician pine, is a species of conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The Cilician pine is valued for its timber and plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
