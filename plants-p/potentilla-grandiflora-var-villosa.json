    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features wiry, somewhat hairy stems that give it its varietal name, and its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular plant among horticulturists and gardeners."
