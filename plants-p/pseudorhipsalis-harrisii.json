    "intro": "Pseudorhipsalis harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's false cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. Pseudorhipsalis harrisii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
