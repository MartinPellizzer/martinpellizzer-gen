    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless knotweed, is a variant of the common knotgrass. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its absence of true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wet or marshy areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
