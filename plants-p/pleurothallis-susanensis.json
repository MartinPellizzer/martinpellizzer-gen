    "intro": "Pleurothallis susanensis, commonly known as Susan's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
