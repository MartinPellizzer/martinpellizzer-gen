    "intro": "Persea frigida, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet, mealy flesh that is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit."
