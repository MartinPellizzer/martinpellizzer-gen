    "intro": "Persoonia mollis subsp. ledifolia, commonly known as the silky pear-fruit, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in coastal and heathland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
