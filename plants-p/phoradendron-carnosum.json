    "intro": "Phoradendron carnosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, and it is often found in humid, forested areas. Phoradendron carnosum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the nutrient cycle of its host tree."
