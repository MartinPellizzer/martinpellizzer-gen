    "intro": "Pterostylis ventricosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed hammer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, greenish-yellow flower spike that resembles a hammer, which is a key adaptation for attracting its specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
