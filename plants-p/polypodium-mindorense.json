    "intro": "Polypodium mindorense, commonly known as the Mindoro fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure and delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the environment. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
