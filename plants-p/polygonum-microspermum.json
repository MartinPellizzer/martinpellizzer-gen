    "intro": "Polygonum microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. The small, dark seeds are dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its successful colonization of new areas."
