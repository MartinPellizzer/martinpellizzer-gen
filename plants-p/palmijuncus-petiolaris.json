It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and elongated, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a single trunk and pinnate leaves, which are often used in horticultural settings for ornamental purposes.
