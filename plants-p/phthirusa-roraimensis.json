    "intro": "Phthirusa roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima phthirus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland plateaus, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
