    "intro": "Prosopis spicata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods containing edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife and humans in desert environments. Prosopis spicata is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in low-water environments. It plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in desert ecosystems."
