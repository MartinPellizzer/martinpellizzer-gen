    "intro": "Pitcairnia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking white and pink inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
