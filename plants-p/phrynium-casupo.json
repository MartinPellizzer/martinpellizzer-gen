    "intro": "Phrynium casupo, commonly known as the Casupo arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of yellow or red. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root crop, similar to arrowroot, and it is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses. Phrynium casupo thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
