It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vivid floral display."
