    "intro": "Pectinariella pterophylla, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife. Pectinariella pterophylla is also an important species for ecological restoration projects in coastal habitats."
