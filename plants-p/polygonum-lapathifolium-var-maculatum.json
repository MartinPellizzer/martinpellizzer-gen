It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and heart-shaped, often reddish-veined leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrasting colors of its foliage and flowers."
