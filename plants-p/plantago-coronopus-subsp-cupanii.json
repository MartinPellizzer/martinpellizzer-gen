    "intro": "Plantago coronopus subsp. cupanii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
