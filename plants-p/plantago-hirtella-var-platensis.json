    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. platensis, commonly known as the plains plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and prairies. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. It produces erect, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish flowers. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
