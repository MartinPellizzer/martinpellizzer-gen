    "intro": "Pavonia sessiliflora var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pavonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often bracted, and the leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
