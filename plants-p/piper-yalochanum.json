It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while the small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds."
