    "intro": "Peltiphyllum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that bloom above the water surface. Peltiphyllum species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. Their leaves are usually broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are often bright and colorful, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
