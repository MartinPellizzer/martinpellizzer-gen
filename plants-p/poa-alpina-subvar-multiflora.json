    "intro": "Poa alpina subvar. multiflora, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with multiple flowers per spikelet, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens and as a ground cover in rocky landscapes."
