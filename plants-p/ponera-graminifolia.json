    "intro": "Ponera graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy ponera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, typical of many grass species. Ponera graminifolia is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and grassy slopes."
