    "intro": "Polypodium lachnopodium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called soroses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium lachnopodium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
