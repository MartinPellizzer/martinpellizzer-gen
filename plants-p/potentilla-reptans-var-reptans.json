    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. reptans, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to June. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and dry meadows."
