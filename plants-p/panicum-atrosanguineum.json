It features tall, upright clumps of dark purple to black foliage that contrast beautifully with its silver-green inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles that add movement and texture to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its unique coloration and architectural form make it a popular choice for modern landscaping."
