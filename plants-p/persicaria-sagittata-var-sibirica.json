    "intro": "Persicaria sagittata var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems that are often reddish in color. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a prominent midrib, and are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively in suitable conditions."
