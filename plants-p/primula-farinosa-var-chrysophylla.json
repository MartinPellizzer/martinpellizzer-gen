    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primrose species. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety foliage that exhibits a golden hue, particularly under sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
