    "intro": "Phelypaea robusta, commonly known as the robust water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features dark green, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water environments. Phelypaea robusta is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
