    "intro": "Polygonum hirsutum var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological restoration."
