    "intro": "Phegopteris salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Phegopteris salicifolia plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
