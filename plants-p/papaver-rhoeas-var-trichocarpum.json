    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. trichocarpum, commonly known as the trichocarpum poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its unique floral and structural features. It typically produces smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the standard Papaver rhoeas, with a more intricate arrangement of petals. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of opium alkaloids. The trichocarpum poppy exhibits a shorter growth cycle and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various garden environments."
