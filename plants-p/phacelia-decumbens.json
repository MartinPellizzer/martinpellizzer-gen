    "intro": "Phacelia decumbens, commonly known as creeping phacelia, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite or whorled, with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Creeping phacelia is valued for its role in attracting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
