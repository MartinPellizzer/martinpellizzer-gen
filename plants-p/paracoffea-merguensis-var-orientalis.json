It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, glossy leaves and bears red or yellow flowers, followed by berries containing seeds. It is closely related to the genus Coffea, though it is not used for commercial coffee production. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
