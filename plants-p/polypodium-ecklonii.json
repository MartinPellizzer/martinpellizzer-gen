    "intro": "Polypodium ecklonii, commonly known as the African cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows on rock faces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a robust rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Polypodium ecklonii is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
