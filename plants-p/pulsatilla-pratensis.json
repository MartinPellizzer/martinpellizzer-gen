It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The fruit is a follicle that releases tiny seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
