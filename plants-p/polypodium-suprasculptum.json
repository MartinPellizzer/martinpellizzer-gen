    "intro": "Polypodium suprasculptum, commonly known as the sculpted polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, sculpted patterns on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The intricate leaf structure of Polypodium suprasculptum makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
