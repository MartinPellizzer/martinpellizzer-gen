    "intro": "Phegopteris maximowiczii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's morphology and habitat make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
