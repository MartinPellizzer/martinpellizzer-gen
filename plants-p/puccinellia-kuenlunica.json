    "intro": "Puccinellia kuenlunica, commonly known as the Kuenlun grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Puccinellia kuenlunica is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
