    "intro": "Pavetta hispida, commonly known as the rough pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Pavetta hispida is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands."
