    "intro": "Pandanus augustianus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces branched inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its robust root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. The plant is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatch in many island communities."
