It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
