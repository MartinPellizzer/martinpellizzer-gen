It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves, which distinguish it from the typical bean plant. This variety is often cultivated for its edible pods, which contain small, tender beans. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both traditional and modern agricultural practices."
