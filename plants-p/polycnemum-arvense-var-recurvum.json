    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. recurvum, commonly known as the curly knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has slender, slightly hairy stems that often curve upward. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface and a slightly toothed margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
