    "intro": "Pterocelastrus marginatus, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are usually green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its thorny structure, it is often used as a hedge or for erosion control in its native habitat."
