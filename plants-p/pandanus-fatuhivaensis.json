    "intro": "Pandanus fatuhivaensis, commonly known as the Hiva pandanus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiky structure, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
