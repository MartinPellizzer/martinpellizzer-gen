    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. viridescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a distinct green hue, distinguishing it from other varieties of Potentilla. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are finely toothed along the edges. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens and natural landscapes."
