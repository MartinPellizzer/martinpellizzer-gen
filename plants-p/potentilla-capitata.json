    "intro": "Potentilla capitata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Potentilla capitata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
