    "intro": "Phoradendron degenianum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it also obtains carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
