    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. heterolepis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their foliage year-round, which adds to the plant's ornamental value in gardens."
