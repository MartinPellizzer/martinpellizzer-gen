    "intro": "Pueraria tuberosa, commonly known as Kwao Krua, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or white flowers. The plant produces tuberous roots that are rich in compounds such as puerarin, which have been studied for their medicinal properties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Pueraria tuberosa is valued both for its traditional uses in herbal medicine and as an ornamental plant."
