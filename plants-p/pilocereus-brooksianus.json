It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of small, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus brooksianus is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
