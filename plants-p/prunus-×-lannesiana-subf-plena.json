    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana subf. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid plant resulting from crosses between Prunus lannesiana and other Prunus species. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. The plant typically produces white or pink flowers, which are often more showy and longer-lasting than those of its parent species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The subsp. plena is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
