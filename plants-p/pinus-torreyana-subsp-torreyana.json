    "intro": "Pinus torreyana subsp. torreyana, commonly known as Torrey pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 1.5 to 2.5 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with dark brown scales. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered one of the rarest pines in the world."
