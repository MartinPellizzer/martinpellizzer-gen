    "intro": "Primula acaulis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates."
