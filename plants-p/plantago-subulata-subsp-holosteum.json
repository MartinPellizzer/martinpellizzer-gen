    "intro": "Plantago subulata subsp. holosteum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
