    "intro": "Psychotria oiapoquensis, commonly known as the Oiapoque Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found growing in the understory of dense tropical forests, where it thrives in the shade and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
