    "intro": "Prunus formosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is celebrated for its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Prunus formosa is also valued for its use in traditional Japanese culture, particularly in the practice of hanami, or flower viewing."
