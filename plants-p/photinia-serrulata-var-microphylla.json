It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are glossy dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by red berries in autumn.

Its dense growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant."
