    "intro": "Phlomoides ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Fergana Valley. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
