    "intro": "Phthirusa ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phthirusa ovata is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
