    "intro": "Prunus cyclamina, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, hairy fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a slightly serrated edge. Prunus cyclamina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
