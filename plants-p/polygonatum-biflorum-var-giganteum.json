    "intro": "Polygonatum biflorum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant Solomon's seal, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pendulous, white or pale green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that mature in autumn. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, contributing to its vigorous growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
