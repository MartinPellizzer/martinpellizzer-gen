    "intro": "Pycnocomon uralense, commonly known as the Ural bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Ural Mountains region. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in raceme-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
