    "intro": "Panicum sciurotis, commonly known as the squirrel-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive blue-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Panicum sciurotis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
