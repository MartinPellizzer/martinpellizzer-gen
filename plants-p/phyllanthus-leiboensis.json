    "intro": "Phyllanthus leiboensis, commonly known as the Leibo's spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, with a compact and bushy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllanthus leiboensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
