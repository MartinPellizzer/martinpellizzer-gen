    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. repressa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact, slow-growing conifer native to the Andes Mountains. It typically reaches a height of only 1 to 2 meters, forming dense, cushion-like growth patterns. Its foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a unique visual texture. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that release seeds in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is well adapted to rocky soils."
