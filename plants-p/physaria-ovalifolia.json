It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces inflated, seed-containing pods that resemble bladders, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Physaria ovalifolia is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
