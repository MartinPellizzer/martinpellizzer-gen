    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. commutata, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils, and it is often used in native plant gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
