    "intro": "Pimpinella diversifolia var. sarmentifera, commonly known as the creeping cowparsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, and are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
