    "intro": "Planchonella gamblei, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a thick, waxy coating. The fruit matures to a dark purple color and contains a single, hard, brown seed. Planchonella gamblei is valued for its timber and has cultural significance in Hawaiian traditions."
