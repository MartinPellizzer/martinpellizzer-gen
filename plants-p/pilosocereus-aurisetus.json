    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurisetus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines and are often adorned with yellowish to golden tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
