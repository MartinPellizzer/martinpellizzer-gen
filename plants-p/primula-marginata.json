    "intro": "Primula marginata, commonly known as the purple primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters and prefers cool, moist environments. It is often found in woodland areas and rocky slopes, where it thrives in partial shade. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
