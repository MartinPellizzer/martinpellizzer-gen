    "intro": "Prunus spinosa subsp. moravica, commonly known as the Moravian blackthorn, is a shrub native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are used in traditional culinary practices. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
