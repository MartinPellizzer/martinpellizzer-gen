    "intro": "Potentilla ornithopoda var. impexa, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
