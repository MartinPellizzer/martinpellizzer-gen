    "intro": "Polypodium patelliferum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium patelliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
