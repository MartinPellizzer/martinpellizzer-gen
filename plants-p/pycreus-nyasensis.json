    "intro": "Pycreus nyasensis, commonly known as the Nyasae's pycreus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
