    "intro": "Palicourea urceolata, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped\" or \"cupule\" plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often glandular-stemmed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruiting bodies that resemble small cups, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
