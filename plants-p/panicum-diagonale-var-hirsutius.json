It is characterized by its coarse, hairy texture and tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their aesthetic appeal. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is drought-tolerant and often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
