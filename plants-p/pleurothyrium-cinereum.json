It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
