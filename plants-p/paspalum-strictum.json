It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Paspalum strictum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
