    "intro": "Pleurandra riparia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by three-lobed, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its aquatic adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
