    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Parietaria officinalis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
