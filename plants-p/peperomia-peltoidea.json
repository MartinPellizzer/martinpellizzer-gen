    "intro": "Peperomia peltoidea, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia peltoidea is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and ornamental appeal."
