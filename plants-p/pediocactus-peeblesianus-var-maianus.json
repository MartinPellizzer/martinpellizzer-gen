    "intro": "Pediocactus peeblesianus var. maianus, commonly known as the Maianus prickly pear, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
