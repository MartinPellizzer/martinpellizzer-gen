    "intro": "Plinia povedae, commonly known as the Poveda's guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow when ripe, and it is edible, though not as widely cultivated as other guava species."
