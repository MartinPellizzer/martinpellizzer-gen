    "intro": "Platystyliparis dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's flame, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystyliparis dryadum is considered a vulnerable species."
