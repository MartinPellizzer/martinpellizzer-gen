It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its aromatic, somewhat bitter scent. Peucedanum coriaceum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
