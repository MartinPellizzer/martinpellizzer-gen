    "intro": "Phegopteris oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow venation pattern that distinguishes it from similar species."
