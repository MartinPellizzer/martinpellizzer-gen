    "intro": "Pleurothallis echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny-fruit orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth. The fruit is a follicle that matures into a spiny capsule, dispersing seeds through wind."
