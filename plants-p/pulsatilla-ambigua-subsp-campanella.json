    "intro": "Pulsatilla ambigua subsp. campanella, commonly known as the campanula larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, fibrous root system and produces a rosette of basal, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, white down. The plant's most distinctive feature is its showy, campanulate (bell-shaped) flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats."
