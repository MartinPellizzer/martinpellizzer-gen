    "intro": "Piper suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species, and is characterized by its aromatic, small, and often spiny leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark blue or black berries, which are edible but have a mild pepper-like flavor. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for ground cover or as a living fence in humid, shaded environments. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
