    "intro": "Pentapanax tomentellus var. distinctus, commonly known as the woolly five-leaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage and its ability to produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is known for its slow growth and preference for shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its morphological uniqueness. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
