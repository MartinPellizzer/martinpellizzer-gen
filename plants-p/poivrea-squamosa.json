    "intro": "Poivrea squamosa, commonly known as the scaly honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like glands, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange, containing a single seed, and are an important food source for birds. Poivrea squamosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
