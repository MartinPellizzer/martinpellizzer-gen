    "intro": "Pogonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and bog habitats in North America. It features a slender, rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is its showy, pinkish-purple flowers with intricate patterns resembling eyes or faces. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
