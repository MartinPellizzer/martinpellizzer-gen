It features small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
