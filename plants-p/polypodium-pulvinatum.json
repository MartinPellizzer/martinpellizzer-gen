    "intro": "Polypodium pulvinatum, commonly known as the pulvinate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pulvinate (swollen) base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Polypodium pulvinatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
