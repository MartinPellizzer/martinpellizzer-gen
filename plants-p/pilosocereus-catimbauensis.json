    "intro": "Pilosocereus catimbauensis, commonly known as the Catimbaua cactus, is a species native to Brazil, particularly found in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring spiny stems and a grayish-green color. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
