    "intro": "Polylepis, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is often covered in a waxy, white coating. These trees can grow to significant heights, with some species reaching over 30 meters in elevation. Polylepis species are adapted to high-altitude environments, often thriving in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing habitat for various endemic species."
