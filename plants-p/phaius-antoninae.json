It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in a cluster at the top of the plant. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are usually arranged in a fan shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Phaius antoninae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
