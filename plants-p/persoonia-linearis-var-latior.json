    "intro": "Persoonia linearis var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved pear-leaf, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are broader than the typical variety, often reaching up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment."
