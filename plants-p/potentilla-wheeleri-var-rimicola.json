    "intro": "Potentilla wheeleri var. rimicola, commonly known as Wheeler's potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact form, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to drought conditions."
