    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. globosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or some varieties as the globe cherry, is a compact, ornamental form of the Japanese flowering cherry. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and public spaces. Its leaves are oval and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to the delicate blossoms. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental beauty and is a symbol of the fleeting nature of life in Japanese culture."
