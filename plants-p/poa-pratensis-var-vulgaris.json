It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
