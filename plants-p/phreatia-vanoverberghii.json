The plant produces striking, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found growing on the forest floor or in low vegetation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
