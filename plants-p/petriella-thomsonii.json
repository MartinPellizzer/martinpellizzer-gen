    "intro": "Petriella thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's petriella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Petriella thomsonii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
