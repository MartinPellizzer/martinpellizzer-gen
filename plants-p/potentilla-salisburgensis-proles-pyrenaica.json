    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It features small, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
