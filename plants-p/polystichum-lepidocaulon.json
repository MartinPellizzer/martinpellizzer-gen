    "intro": "Polystichum lepidocaulon, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum lepidocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
