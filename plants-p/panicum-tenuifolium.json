It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn golden in the fall. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Little bluestem is also an important component of prairie ecosystems."
