    "intro": "Pavonia speciosa, commonly known as the showy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pavonia speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
