It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
