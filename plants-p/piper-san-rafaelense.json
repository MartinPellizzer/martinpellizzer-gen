    "intro": "Piper san-rafaelense, commonly known as San Rafael pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Belize. The plant is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and the presence of small, heart-shaped leaves. Its fruits are typically small, green berries that turn red when mature, and they are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal research."
