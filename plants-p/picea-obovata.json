    "intro": "Picea obovata, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and gray-blue foliage that turns a striking silver-white in winter. The tree has short, stout cones that hang downward, and its bark is smooth and pale when young, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Picea obovata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
