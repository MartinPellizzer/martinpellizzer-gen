It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits resembling pineapples. These fruits are often consumed raw or used in local cuisines. The Kivi pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
