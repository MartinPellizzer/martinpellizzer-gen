It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. The silky wattle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
