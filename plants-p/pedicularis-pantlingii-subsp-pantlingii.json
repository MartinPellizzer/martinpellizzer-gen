    "intro": "Pedicularis pantlingii subsp. pantlingii, commonly known as the Pantling's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
