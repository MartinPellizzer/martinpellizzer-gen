    "intro": "Pernettya parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Pernettya parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
