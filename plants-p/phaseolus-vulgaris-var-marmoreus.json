    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. marmoreus, commonly known as the marble bean, is a striking variety of common bean characterized by its ornamental, mottled leaves and vibrant flowers. This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Its foliage displays a unique marbled pattern of green and white, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant produces edible pods that contain small, round beans, though it is primarily cultivated for its visual appeal rather than its yield. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
