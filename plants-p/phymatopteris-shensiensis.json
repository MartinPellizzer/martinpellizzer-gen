    "intro": "Phymatopteris shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in nutrient absorption and propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns."
