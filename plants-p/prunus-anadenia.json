    "intro": "Prunus anadenia, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It typically grows to a height of about 4\u20136 meters and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a dark green color during the growing season. The fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in summer, though it is not typically edible for humans. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
