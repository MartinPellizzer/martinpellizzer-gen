    "intro": "Pityrocarpa inaequalis, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
