    "intro": "Panicum kochii, commonly known as Koch's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
