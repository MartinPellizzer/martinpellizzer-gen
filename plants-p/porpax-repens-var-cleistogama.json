    "intro": "Porpax repens var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous prostrate porpax, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances seed production in less favorable conditions. The plant typically features small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its unique reproductive adaptations and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
