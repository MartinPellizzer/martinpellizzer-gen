    "intro": "Polypodium semipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
