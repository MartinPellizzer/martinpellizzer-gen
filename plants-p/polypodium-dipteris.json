    "intro": "Polypodium dipteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous areas. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
