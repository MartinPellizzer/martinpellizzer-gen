    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. campestre, commonly known as red rice grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairlike leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a reddish color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its striking red flowers that appear in late summer to early fall."
