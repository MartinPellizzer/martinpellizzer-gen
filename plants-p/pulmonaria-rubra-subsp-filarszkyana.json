    "intro": "Pulmonaria rubra subsp. filarszkyana, commonly known as the Filarszky's lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive basal rosette of leaves with silver-white markings. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between its hairy, spotted leaves and delicate floral display."
