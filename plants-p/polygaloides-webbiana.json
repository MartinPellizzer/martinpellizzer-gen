    "intro": "Polygaloides webbiana, commonly known as the Natal spiderflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
