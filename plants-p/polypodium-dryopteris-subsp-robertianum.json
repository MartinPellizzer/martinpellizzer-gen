    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris subsp. robertianum, commonly known as the Robert's wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
