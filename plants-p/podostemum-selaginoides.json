    "intro": "Podostemum selaginoides, commonly known as the water primrose, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of streams and ponds, with its roots anchored in submerged substrates. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged, while its flowers are borne on short stalks above the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial environments, facilitating pollination by insects. Podostemum selaginoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
