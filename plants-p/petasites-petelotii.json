    "intro": "Petasites petelotii, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can dominate certain ecosystems. Petasites petelotii is also notable for its edible tubers, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
