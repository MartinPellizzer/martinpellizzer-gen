    "intro": "Parthenium lobatum, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Parthenium lobatum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats."
