It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruits."
