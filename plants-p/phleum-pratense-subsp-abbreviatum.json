    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to the typical tall oatgrass. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
