    "intro": "Panax ginseng var. repens, commonly known as red ginseng, is a variant of the ginseng plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea, China, and Russia. It is characterized by its distinctive red roots, which are typically harvested after a longer growth period than the regular ginseng. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is known for its adaptogenic properties. Its leaves are alternate, palmately compound, and have a serrated edge. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by the formation of red berries."
