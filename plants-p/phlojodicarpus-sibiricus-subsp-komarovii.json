    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus sibiricus subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
