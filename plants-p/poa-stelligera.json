    "intro": "Poa stelligera, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine tundras and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers. Poa stelligera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
