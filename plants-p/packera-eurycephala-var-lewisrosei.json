    "intro": "Packera eurycephala var. lewisrosei, commonly known as Lewis's roseleaf, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf bases compared to other packera species, contributing to its unique ecological niche."
