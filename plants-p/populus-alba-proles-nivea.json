    "intro": "Populus alba proles nivea, commonly known as the white poplar or European white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its white bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, and its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate pollution, making it a common urban tree."
