The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in hue, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Pennisetum orientale is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as birds and butterflies."
