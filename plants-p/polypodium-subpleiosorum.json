    "intro": "Polypodium subpleiosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
