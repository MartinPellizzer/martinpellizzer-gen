    "intro": "Potentilla hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features dense, sprawling stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red or orange berries. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a slightly serrated edge. Potentilla hansenii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
