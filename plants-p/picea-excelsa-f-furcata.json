    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. furcata, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species that thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bark is thin and scaly, and it produces small, cylindrical cones that contain winged seeds. This subspecies is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in alpine ecosystems where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
