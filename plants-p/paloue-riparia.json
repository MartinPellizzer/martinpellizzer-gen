    "intro": "Paloue riparia, commonly known as the riverbank paloue, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow, slow-moving water. Paloue riparia is often used in traditional medicine and is also a popular ornamental plant in water gardens."
