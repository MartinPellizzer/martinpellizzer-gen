    "intro": "Penstemon incanus, commonly known as the hairy penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon incanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
