    "intro": "Panicum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are adapted to dispersal by wind. Its deep root system allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Panicum calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
