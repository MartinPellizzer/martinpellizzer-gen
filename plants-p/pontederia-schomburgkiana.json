    "intro": "Pontederia schomburgkiana, commonly known as the purple rush or Schomburgk's water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a dense network of veins. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats."
