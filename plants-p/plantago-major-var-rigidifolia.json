    "intro": "Plantago major var. rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its stiff, upright leaves. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
