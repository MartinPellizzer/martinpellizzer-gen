    "intro": "Piptanthocereus stenogonus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's structure and flowering habits reflect its evolutionary response to its native habitat's challenging conditions."
