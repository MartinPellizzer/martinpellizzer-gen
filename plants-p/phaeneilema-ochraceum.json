    "intro": "Phaeneilema ochraceum, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with elongated petals and a distinctive yellowish-orange coloration. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
