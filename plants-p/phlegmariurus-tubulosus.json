    "intro": "Phlegmariurus tubulosus, commonly known as the tubular staghorn fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy structure, with a central stem covered in dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Phlegmariurus tubulosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
