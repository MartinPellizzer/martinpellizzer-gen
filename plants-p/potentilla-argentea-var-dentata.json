    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. dentata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-white, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are typically lobed or toothed, as indicated by the variety name *dentata*. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
