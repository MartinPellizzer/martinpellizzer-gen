    "intro": "Polypodium brasiliense var. pleiosorum, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
