    "intro": "Potentilla oweriniana var. elata, commonly known as the tall potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or alpine displays. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates with moderate moisture."
