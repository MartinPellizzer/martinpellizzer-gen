    "intro": "Petrorhagia dianthoides, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Petrorhagia dianthoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
