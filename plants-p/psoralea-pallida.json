    "intro": "Psoralea pallida, commonly known as the pale psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small, pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain small, rounded seeds. Psoralea pallida is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
