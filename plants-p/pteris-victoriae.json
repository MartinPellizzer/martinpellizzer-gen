    "intro": "Pteris victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it an effective ground cover. Pteris victoriae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
