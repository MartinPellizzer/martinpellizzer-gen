    "intro": "Pulicaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its flowers are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. Pulicaria congesta thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
