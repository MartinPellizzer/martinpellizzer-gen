    "intro": "Paranephelium acanthocarpum, commonly known as the spiny-fruited fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with numerous fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover. The plant's unique spiny fruits and delicate foliage make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
