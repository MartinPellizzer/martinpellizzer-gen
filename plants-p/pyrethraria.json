    "intro": "Pyrethraria, commonly known as the pyrethrum plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Asia, Africa, and Australia, with species such as Pyrethraria thomsonii being particularly notable. The plant is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers. Pyrethraria species are known for their natural pyrethrin content, which makes them effective botanical insecticides. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and for the extraction of insecticidal compounds."
