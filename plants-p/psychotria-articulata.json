    "intro": "Psychotria articulata, commonly known as the \"arrow poison plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly the toxic compound curare, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting."
