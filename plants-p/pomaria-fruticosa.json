    "intro": "Pomaria fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Pomaria fruticosa is adapted to salt spray and is an important plant for stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
