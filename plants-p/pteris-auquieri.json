    "intro": "Pteris auquieri, commonly known as the Auquier's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
