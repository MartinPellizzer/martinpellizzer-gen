    "intro": "Panicum stoloniferum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Due to its low maintenance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ornamental ground cover."
