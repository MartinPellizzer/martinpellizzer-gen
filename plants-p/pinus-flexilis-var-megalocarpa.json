It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire. The cones of this species are large and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters, containing numerous seeds.

This variety is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high elevation."
