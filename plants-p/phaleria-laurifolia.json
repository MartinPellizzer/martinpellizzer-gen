It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are arranged in a compact, almost circular pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.
