    "intro": "Pinus squamata, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed cones that release seeds in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
