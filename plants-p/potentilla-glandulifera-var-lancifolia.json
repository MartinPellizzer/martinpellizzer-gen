    "intro": "Potentilla glandulifera var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a rough texture and contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
