    "intro": "Phloeophila magnifica, commonly known as the golden bark tree, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, smooth, and golden-colored bark, which peels in thin layers as the tree matures. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a deep green color with a slight waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
