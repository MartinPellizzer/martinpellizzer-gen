    "intro": "Polypodium xantholepis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Polypodium xantholepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
