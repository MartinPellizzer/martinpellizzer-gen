It produces elongated, edible pods that are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. The plant has compound leaves with palmate lobes and produces yellow flowers that develop into the bean pods. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The seeds within the pods are rich in nutrients and are an important food source in indigenous communities."
