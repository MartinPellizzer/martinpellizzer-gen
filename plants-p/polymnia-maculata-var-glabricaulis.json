    "intro": "Polymnia maculata var. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed polymnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, glabrous stems that are typically reddish in color and often branching near the base. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, with a basal rosette formation. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Polymnia maculata."
