    "intro": "Paludorchis palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, boggy environments and is often found in swampy areas along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently. Paludorchis palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insect species."
