    "intro": "Paris caojianensis, commonly known as the Caojian mountain adder's mouth, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble the mouth of an adder. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments at high elevations. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
