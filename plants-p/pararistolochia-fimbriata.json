    "intro": "Pararistolochia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed pipevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a slender, elongated capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores and a potential hazard to livestock."
