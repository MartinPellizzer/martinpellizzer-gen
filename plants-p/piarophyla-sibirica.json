    "intro": "Piarophyla sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features a short, upright stem covered in dense, woolly hairs that help insulate it against harsh winter conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to low-nutrient, well-drained soils. Piarophyla sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
