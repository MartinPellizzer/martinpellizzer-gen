It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Pearsonia marginata is a key component of the coastal vegetation in New Zealand, providing habitat and stabilizing dunes."
