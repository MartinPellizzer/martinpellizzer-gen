    "intro": "Polygonum mollifolium, commonly known as soft-leaved smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late summer to early autumn. Polygonum mollifolium is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
