    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, often white or pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Primulaceae family."
