    "intro": "Ponera subquadrilabia, commonly known as the four-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
