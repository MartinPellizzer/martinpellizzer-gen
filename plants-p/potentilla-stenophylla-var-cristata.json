    "intro": "Potentilla stenophylla var. cristata, commonly known as the crested cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The varietal form 'cristata' is distinguished by its distinctive, crest-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance."
