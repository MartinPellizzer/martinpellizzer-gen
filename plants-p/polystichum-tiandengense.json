    "intro": "Polystichum tiandengense, commonly known as the Tiandeng fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
