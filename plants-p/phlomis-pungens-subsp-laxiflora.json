    "intro": "Phlomis pungens subsp. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower phlomis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. This subspecies is closely related to other Phlomis species, but it is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flower heads."
