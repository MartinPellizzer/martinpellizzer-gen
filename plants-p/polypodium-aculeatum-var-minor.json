    "intro": "Polypodium aculeatum var. minor, commonly known as the small holly fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, contributing to its ability to spread slowly. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, hairy structures called indusia."
