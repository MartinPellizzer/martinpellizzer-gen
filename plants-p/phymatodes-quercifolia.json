    "intro": "Phymatodes quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble those of the oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Phymatodes quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
