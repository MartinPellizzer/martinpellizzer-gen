    "intro": "Ponerorchis pathakiana, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, adapting to its nutrient-poor mountainous environment. Its leaves are slender and often clustered at the base, supporting the plant's growth in harsh conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ponerorchis pathakiana is considered a conservation concern."
