    "intro": "Packera resedifolia, commonly known as the showy aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Packera resedifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its blooming season."
