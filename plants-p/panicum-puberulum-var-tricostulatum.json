    "intro": "Panicum puberulum var. tricostulatum, commonly known as the tricostulate panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, with a distinctive pubescent (hairy) texture. The variety tricostulatum is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins and a unique arrangement of vascular bundles."
