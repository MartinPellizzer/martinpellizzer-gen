    "intro": "Petastoma malmei, commonly known as the Malme's petasite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and tall, branched flowering stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are surrounded by specialized bracts, a feature typical of the genus Petasites. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
