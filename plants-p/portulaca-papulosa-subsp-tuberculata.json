    "intro": "Portulaca papulosa subsp. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with warm climates."
