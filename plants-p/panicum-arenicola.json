    "intro": "Panicum arenicola, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland sand plains. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
