    "intro": "Pseudocedrela cylindrica, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its durable wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
