    "intro": "Padus virginiana var. salicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf black cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the plant. It produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open woods or along stream banks."
