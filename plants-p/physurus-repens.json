It is a sprawling vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that contain seeds with a hard, dark coat. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas."
