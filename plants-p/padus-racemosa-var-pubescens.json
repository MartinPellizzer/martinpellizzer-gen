    "intro": "Padus racemosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy white crabsapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) bark and leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, tart berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
