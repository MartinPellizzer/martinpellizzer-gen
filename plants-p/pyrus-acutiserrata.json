    "intro": "Pyrus acutiserrata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling small pears. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally grown in gardens and orchards."
