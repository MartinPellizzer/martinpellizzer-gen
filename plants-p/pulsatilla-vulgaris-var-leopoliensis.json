It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers with prominent, rounded sepals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.
