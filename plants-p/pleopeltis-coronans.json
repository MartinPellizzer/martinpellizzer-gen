    "intro": "Pleopeltis coronans, commonly known as the crowned rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a dark green coloration and a distinctive crown-like appearance at the base. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
