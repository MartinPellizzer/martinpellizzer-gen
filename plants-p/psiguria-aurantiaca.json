It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red inflorescences that resemble torches, which bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spiky clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
