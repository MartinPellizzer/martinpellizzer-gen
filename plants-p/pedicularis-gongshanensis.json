    "intro": "Pedicularis gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it relies on host plants for some of its nutrients. Its flowers are usually reddish or orange in color, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
