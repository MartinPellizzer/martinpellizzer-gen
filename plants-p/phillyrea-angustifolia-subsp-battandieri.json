It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) in texture. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Phillyrea angustifolia."
