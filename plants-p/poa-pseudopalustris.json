    "intro": "Poa pseudopalustris, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as dunes, salt marshes, and coastal meadows. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa pseudopalustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
