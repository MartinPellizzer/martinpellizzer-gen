    "intro": "Pilocereus strausii var. fricii, commonly known as the Frici's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming pattern, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xeriscaping."
