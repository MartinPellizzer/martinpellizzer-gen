    "intro": "Phoradendron engelmannii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and contributing to the nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
