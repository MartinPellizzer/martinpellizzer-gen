    "intro": "Plantago krajinae, commonly known as the Krajina plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky and nutrient-poor soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
