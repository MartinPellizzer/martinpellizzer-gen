    "intro": "Psychotria fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in the rainforests of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, typically in the understorey of dense forests. Psychotria fosbergii is notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
