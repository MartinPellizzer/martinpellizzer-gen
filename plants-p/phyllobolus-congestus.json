It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body and a coloration that typically ranges from brown to reddish-brown. The plant it inhabits is often a host for its larvae, which feed on the leaves, causing visible damage. This beetle is found in various parts of Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. Its life cycle includes several developmental stages, with adults emerging from the soil to feed on foliage."
