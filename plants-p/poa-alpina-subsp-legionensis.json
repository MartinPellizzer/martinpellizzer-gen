    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. legionensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
