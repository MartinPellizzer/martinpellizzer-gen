    "intro": "Pimpinella dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, and it produces small, dry fruits that are used for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
