    "intro": "Pandanus pistikos, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a shrub-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring a woody stem and a dense crown of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a fragrant aroma, which is often used in traditional cooking and crafts. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, fragrant flowers, which eventually develop into fibrous fruits. The plant is well adapted to coastal and humid environments, making it a common sight in island ecosystems."
