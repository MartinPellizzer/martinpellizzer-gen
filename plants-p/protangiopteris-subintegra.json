    "intro": "Protangiopteris subintegra, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Equisetinales. It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are remnants of its ancient evolutionary lineage. This plant thrived during the Carboniferous period and is considered a key component of the coal-forming forests of that era. Its structure suggests it was a vascular plant with specialized tissues for water transport. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the ecological systems of its time."
