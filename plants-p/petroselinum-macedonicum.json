    "intro": "Petroselinum macedonicum, commonly known as Macedonian parsley, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
