    "intro": "Paulownia viscosa, commonly known as the common paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree is known for its rapid growth and lightweight, porous wood, which is often used in musical instruments and furniture. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Paulownia viscosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
