    "intro": "Pisonia subcapitata, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
