    "intro": "Phymatodes powellii, commonly known as the Powell's phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots can form extensive networks, which help it survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone conditions. Phymatodes powellii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
