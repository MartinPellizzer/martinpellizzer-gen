    "intro": "Pleione arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, often fragrant flower with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a common feature among orchids. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
