    "intro": "Pleopeltis smithii, commonly known as the Smith's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
