    "intro": "Panicum hillmanii, commonly known as Hillman\u2019s panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle made up of small, two-lobed spikelets. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
