    "intro": "Platanthera kuenkelei, commonly known as the Kuenkele's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. It is notable for its lack of showy petals and its reliance on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
