    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 adscendens, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, and the plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Potentilla \u00d7 adscendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
