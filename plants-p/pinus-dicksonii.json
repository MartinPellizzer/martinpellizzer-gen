    "intro": "Pinus dicksonii, commonly known as the Dickson's pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for years. The bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and environmental stress. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
