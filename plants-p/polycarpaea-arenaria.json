    "intro": "Polycarpaea arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It produces multiple flower clusters along the stems, which attract various pollinators. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
