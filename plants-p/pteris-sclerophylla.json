    "intro": "Pteris sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often recurved and have a distinctive, compact appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris sclerophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
