    "intro": "Pyrus micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, subacid berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Pyrus micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
