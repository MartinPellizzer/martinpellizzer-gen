    "intro": "Psychotria oligotricha, commonly known as the \"Coca plant\" or \"Yareta,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, cold environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have been historically associated with the production of cocaine. However, due to its ecological importance and conservation status, it is now protected in many regions."
