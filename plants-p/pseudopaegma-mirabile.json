It is native to the high elevations of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers that range from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Pseudopaegma mirabile is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
