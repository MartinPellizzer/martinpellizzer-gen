    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus subsp. sacer, commonly known as the crimson sacred orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid red petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of darker hues. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowering period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
