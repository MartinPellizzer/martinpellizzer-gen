It is characterized by its thick, ribbed trunk and sparse, often spiny foliage. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its unique morphology makes it a striking and recognizable species within the Pachypodium genus."
