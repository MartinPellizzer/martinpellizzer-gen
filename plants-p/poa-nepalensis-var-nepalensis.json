    "intro": "Poa nepalensis var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
