    "intro": "Poa fluitans, commonly known as floating bentgrass, is a herbaceous plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are adapted to float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. Its roots are typically submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Poa fluitans is often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
