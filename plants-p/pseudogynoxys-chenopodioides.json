    "intro": "Pseudogynoxys chenopodioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Pseudogynoxys chenopodioides is well-suited to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
