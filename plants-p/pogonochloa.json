These plants are characterized by their distinctive hairy or bearded appearance, particularly on the leaf blades and inflorescences. Pogonochloa species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. They have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
