It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as cliffs and slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
