    "intro": "Plantago argentea subsp. argentea, commonly known as silver plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white, velvety leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
