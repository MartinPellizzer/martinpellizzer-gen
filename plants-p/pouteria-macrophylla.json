    "intro": "Pouteria macrophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard, three-chambered capsule. This species plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest."
