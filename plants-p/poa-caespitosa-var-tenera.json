    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. tenera, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a variant of the tufted grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit, forming compact clumps or tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
