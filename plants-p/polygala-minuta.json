    "intro": "Polygala minuta, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygala minuta is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role."
