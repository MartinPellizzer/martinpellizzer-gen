    "intro": "Pseudencyclia hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a distinctive member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and its pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
