It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
