    "intro": "Prunus tartarea, commonly known as the Tartarian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus tartarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
