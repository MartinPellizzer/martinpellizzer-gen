    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subpedata, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has thin, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks."
