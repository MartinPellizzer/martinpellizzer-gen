    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub pine, is a compact, dwarf form of the Scots pine. It exhibits a dense, bushy growth habit with short, stiff needles and small, clustered cones. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, such as rocky soils and high altitudes, due to its slow growth and cold tolerance. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces aromatic resin, typical of the pine family. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
