    "intro": "Piper dubium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
