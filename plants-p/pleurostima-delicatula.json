    "intro": "Pleurostima delicatula, commonly known as the delicate pleurostima, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
