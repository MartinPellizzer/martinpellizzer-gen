    "intro": "Primula nanobella, commonly known as the miniature primrose, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact foliage and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It is often cultivated as a rock garden or alpine plant due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to shaded garden spaces."
