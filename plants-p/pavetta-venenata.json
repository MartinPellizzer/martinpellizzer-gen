    "intro": "Pavetta venenata, commonly known as poison pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves and berries contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
