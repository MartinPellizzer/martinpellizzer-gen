    "intro": "Podostigma, commonly known as a type of specialized plant structure, is a small, often rounded or oval-shaped appendage found on the stigma of certain flowering plants. It is typically located at the base of the stigma and plays a role in pollen reception. The podostigma is usually covered with a thin layer of cuticle and may have a slightly raised or lobed surface. It is most commonly observed in plants of the family Polygonaceae, such as the buckwheat genus. This structure aids in the efficient capture and retention of pollen grains during pollination."
