    "intro": "Pelexia trachyglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pelexia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue to violet flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Pelexia trachyglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
