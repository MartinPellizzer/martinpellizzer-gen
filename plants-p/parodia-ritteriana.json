    "intro": "Parodia ritteriana, commonly known as the Ritter's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Argentina. It is a low-growing, spherical plant with a thick, ribbed stem that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Parodia ritteriana is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
