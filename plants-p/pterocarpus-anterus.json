    "intro": "Pterocarpus anterus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
