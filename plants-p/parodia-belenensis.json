It is a compact, globular cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of long, white, woolly spines that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and attractive choice for succulent enthusiasts."
