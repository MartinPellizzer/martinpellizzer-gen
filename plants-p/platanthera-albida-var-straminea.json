    "intro": "Platanthera albida var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its photosynthetic stems. It is native to parts of North America and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
