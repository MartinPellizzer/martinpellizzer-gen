    "intro": "Phyllobolus humilis, commonly known as the lowland phyllobolus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
