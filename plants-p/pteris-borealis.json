    "intro": "Pteris borealis, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
