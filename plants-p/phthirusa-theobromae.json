    "intro": "Phthirusa theobromae, commonly known as the cocoa mealybug, is a small, sap-sucking insect that primarily infests cacao plants. It belongs to the family Pseudococcidae and is characterized by its fluffy, waxy secretions that cover its body. The plant's botanical aspects are most relevant in its role as a host for this pest, particularly in tropical regions where cacao is cultivated. The mealybug feeds on the plant's sap, causing stunted growth and reduced yields. Its presence can also lead to the spread of plant pathogens, making it a significant concern for agricultural sustainability."
