    "intro": "Pyrus spinosa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed spindle tree, is a variant of the spindle tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Pyrus spinosa. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are typically sour. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
