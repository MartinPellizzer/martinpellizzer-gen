It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Pteris cretica and Pteris vittata, resulting in a distinctive morphology. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. Pteris \u00d7 wangii is also valued for its ability to purify water, making it useful in aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects."
