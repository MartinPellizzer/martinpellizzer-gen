    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. debilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its delicate appearance. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature and more fragile growth compared to the typical form of Potentilla verna."
