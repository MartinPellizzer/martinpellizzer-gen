    "intro": "Pholidophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that resemble the appearance of ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Pholidophyllum is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately preserved species in its natural ecosystem."
