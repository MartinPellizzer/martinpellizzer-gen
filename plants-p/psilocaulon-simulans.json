    "intro": "Psilocaulon simulans, commonly known as the false psilocybe, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Psilocybiaceae. It is characterized by its small, club-shaped fruiting bodies that typically range from 1 to 3 centimeters in height. The cap is usually smooth and ranges in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, while the stem is slender and often has a slight bulbous base. It is often found in association with certain trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its similar appearance to other psychoactive mushrooms, it is sometimes confused with species containing hallucinogenic compounds."
