    "intro": "Pityrogramma mira, commonly known as the golden water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Pityrogramma mira is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
