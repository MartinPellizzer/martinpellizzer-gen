It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a white lip and yellow-green sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
