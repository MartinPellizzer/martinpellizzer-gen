    "intro": "Pyrus deflexa, commonly known as the flexible crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often arching branches and small, oval leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellow or red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
