    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. leucum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for opium production. The plant produces small, rounded capsules that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a food source for birds. Its flowers are typically less showy than those of the common opium poppy, with a more subdued color palette. The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and pharmacological research."
