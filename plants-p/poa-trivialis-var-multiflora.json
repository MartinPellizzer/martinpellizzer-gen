    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. multiflora, commonly known as the common meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as lawns, roadsides, and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and supporting local insect populations."
