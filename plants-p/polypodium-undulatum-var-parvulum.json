    "intro": "Polypodium undulatum var. parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is often found growing on soil or along rocky surfaces, preferring cool and humid conditions."
