    "intro": "Panicum tennesseense, commonly known as Tennessee dropseed, is a native grass species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for dandelion fluff. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for native gardens and restoration projects. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Tennessee dropseed is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
