    "intro": "Populus pubescens f. vaillantiana, commonly known as the Vaillantiana poplar, is a shrub-like variant of the poplar genus native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its finely hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for early pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin, papery layers. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its compact form and seasonal interest."
