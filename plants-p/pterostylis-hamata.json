    "intro": "Pterostylis hamata, commonly known as the common spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, hairy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a single, elongated flower. The orchid's flower is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance with a prominent, hooded labellum. It is pollinated by specific insects, particularly thynnine wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral structure."
