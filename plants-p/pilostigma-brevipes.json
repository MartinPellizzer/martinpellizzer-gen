The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Pilostigma brevipes is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
