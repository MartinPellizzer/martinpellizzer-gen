    "intro": "Pyrus pashia var. semiaquatica, commonly known as the swamp white pear, is a variant of the white pear tree native to the wetlands and riparian zones of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy areas near rivers and lakes. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
