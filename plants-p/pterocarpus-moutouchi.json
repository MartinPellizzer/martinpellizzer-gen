    "intro": "Pterocarpus moutouchi, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pterocarpus moutouchi is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
