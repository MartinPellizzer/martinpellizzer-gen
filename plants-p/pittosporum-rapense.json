    "intro": "Pittosporum rapense, commonly known as the New Zealand pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the autumn, adding seasonal visual interest. The plant produces fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates. Pittosporum rapense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
