    "intro": "Plutarchia rigida, commonly known as the rigid plume, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and clusters of delicate, feathery flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Plutarchia rigida is considered a vulnerable species."
