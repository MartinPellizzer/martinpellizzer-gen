    "intro": "Polygala nicaeensis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf milkweed, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which varies significantly between individuals, giving it the name \"heterophylla.\" The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
