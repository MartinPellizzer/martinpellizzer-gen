    "intro": "Perotis clarksonii, commonly known as the Clark's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus. Perotis clarksonii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in arid regions."
