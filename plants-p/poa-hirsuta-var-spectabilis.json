    "intro": "Poa hirsuta var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, silver-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced during the flowering season. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to violet flowers, which are often clustered in a distinctive, showy arrangement. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and ecological benefits."
