    "intro": "Procris strigosa, commonly known as the rough procris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Procris strigosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its drought tolerance."
