    "intro": "Parnassia filchneri, commonly known as the Filchner's parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes buttercups and other related genera. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Parnassia filchneri is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is considered an indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
