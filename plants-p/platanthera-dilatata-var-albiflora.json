    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat."
