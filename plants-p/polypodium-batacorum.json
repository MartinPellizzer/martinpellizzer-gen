    "intro": "Polypodium batacorum, commonly known as the Batacorum wall-r Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that grow on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ability to capture moisture from the air. Polypodium batacorum is often found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in the understory with indirect light."
