    "intro": "Polystichum dissectum, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fern\u2019s foliage remains green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
