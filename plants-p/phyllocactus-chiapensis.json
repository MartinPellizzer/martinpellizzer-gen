    "intro": "Phyllocactus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It is distinguished by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil efficiently. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a rare example of a cactus adapted to a tropical rainforest setting."
