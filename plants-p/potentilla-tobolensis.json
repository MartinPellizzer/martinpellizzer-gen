    "intro": "Potentilla tobolensis, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Potentilla tobolensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, temperate conditions."
