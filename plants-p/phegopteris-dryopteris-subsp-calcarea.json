    "intro": "Phegopteris dryopteris subsp. calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This subspecies is distinguished by its calcareous (lime-rich) soil preference, which influences its growth and distribution."
