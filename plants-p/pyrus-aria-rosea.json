    "intro": "Pyrus aria rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered pear. This ornamental tree is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white blossoms that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a glossy green surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant is relatively low maintenance and can grow to a height of 8 to 12 feet, providing both aesthetic value and a habitat for pollinators."
