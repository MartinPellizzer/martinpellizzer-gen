    "intro": "Poa podolica, commonly known as the Podolic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, often disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to cool and moist conditions, often thriving in areas with moderate to heavy rainfall. Poa podolica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
