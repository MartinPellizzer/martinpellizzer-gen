    "intro": "Polystichum braunii subsp. kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschatka wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas near the coast. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
