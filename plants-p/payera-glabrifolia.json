    "intro": "Payera glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved payera, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
