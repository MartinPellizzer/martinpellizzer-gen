    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens lusus rosea, commonly known as the roseate pasqueflower, is a rare and striking variant of the pasqueflower. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant features showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, white down. This botanical curiosity is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
