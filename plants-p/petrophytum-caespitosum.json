    "intro": "Petrophytum caespitosum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Petrophytum caespitosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems."
