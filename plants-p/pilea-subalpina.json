    "intro": "Pilea subalpina, commonly known as the alpine pilea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense, rounded foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Pilea subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
