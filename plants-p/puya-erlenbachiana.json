    "intro": "Puya erlenbachiana, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 6 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red, orange, and yellow bracts. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
