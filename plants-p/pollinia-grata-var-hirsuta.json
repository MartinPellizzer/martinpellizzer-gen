    "intro": "Pollinia grata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pollinia, is a variant of the pollinia genus characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on the pollinia. This plant is a type of orchid, specifically belonging to the Orchidaceae family, and is native to certain regions in Southeast Asia. The hairy structure of its pollinia aids in the efficient transfer of pollen to the stigma of compatible flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
