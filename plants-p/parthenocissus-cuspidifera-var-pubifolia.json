    "intro": "Parthenocissus cuspidifera var. pubifolia, commonly known as the pubescent ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, fences, and trellises. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
