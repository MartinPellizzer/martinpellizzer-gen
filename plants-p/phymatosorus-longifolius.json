    "intro": "Phymatosorus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaf cliff brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
