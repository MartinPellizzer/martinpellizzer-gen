    "intro": "Phlebocarya, commonly known as the swamp saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically found in moist or wetland environments, often near streams or in marshy areas. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Phlebocarya species are herbaceous perennials, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific hydrological conditions."
