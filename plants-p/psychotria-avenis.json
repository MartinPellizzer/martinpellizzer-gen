    "intro": "Psychotria avenis, commonly known as the \"arrow poison plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers. It contains alkaloids, including the potent neurotoxin curare, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting. Psychotria avenis plays a significant role in both traditional medicine and ecological studies due to its unique chemical composition."
