    "intro": "Polystichum variiforme, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of dark brown to black pinnae that contrast with the lighter green rachises. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings."
