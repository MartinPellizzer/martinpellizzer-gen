    "intro": "Phylica tysonii, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, white or pale pink flower heads that resemble snowflakes. The plant produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Phylica tysonii is often used in ornamental gardening for its frost-resistant foliage and seasonal floral display."
