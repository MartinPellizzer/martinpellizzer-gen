    "intro": "Prosthechea fusca, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and striking blackish-purple flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Prosthechea fusca typically blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant, showy inflorescences. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
