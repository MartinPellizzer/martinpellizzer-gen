    "intro": "Pentacrostigma nyctanthum, commonly known as the night-flower climbing plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody vines and showy, nocturnal flowers. The plant produces large, fragrant blooms that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through a mechanism involving the explosive dehiscence of its valves."
