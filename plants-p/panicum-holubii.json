    "intro": "Panicum holubii, commonly known as Holub's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in disturbed soils."
