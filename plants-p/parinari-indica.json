    "intro": "Parinari indica, commonly known as the Indian parinari, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
