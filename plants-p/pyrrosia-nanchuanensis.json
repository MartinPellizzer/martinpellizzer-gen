It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to specific ecological niches. Its fronds are usually divided into segments, forming a rosette-like structure that helps in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
