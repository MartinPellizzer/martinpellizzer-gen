    "intro": "Parodia capillitaensis, commonly known as the Woolly Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
