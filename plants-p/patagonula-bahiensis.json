    "intro": "Patagonula bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia Patagonula, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in a humid subtropical climate. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, bract-like structures that aid in wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
