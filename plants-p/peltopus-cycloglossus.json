    "intro": "Peltopus cycloglossus, commonly known as the cycloglossus cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, providing shade and habitat for various organisms. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are either male or female, with the female cones producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, Peltopus cycloglossus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
