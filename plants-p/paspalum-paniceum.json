    "intro": "Paspalum paniceum, commonly known as panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Paspalum paniceum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
