    "intro": "Prunus turonensis, commonly known as the Turkish cherry or Turonian cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features smooth, grey bark with a distinctive flaky texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Prunus turonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and is also valued for its fruit in local cuisines."
