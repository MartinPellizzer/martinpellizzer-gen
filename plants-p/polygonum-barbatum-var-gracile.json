It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
