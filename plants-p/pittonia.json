    "intro": "Pittonia, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of two species, Pittonia mollis and Pittonia obconica, both native to South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Pittonia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in humid, tropical environments. They have simple, alternate leaves and produce capsules as their fruit, containing numerous small seeds."
