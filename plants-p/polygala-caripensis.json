    "intro": "Polygala caripensis, commonly known as the Carip\u00e9 polygala, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which includes a variety of herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its delicate, sparsely hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala caripensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
