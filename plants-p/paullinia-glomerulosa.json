    "intro": "Paullinia glomerulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, red or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in humid forests and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
