    "intro": "Pedicularis bella f. holophylla, commonly known as the white lady's mantle, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, though this particular species is not fully parasitic. The plant features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
