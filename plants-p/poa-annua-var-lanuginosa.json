    "intro": "Poa annua var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the fuzzy annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This variety is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed soils due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It produces small, blue-green seed heads that are distinctive in appearance. While it is a common weed in turfgrass, it also has ornamental value in certain garden settings."
