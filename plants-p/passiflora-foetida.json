    "intro": "Passiflora foetida, commonly known as the stinking passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, complex flowers that feature a unique arrangement of petals, sepals, and a crown-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Passiflora foetida is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable in its flowers."
