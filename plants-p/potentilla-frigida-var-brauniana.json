    "intro": "Potentilla frigida var. brauniana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
