    "intro": "Polystachya undulata, commonly known as the undulating sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that are often undulating in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polystachya undulata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
