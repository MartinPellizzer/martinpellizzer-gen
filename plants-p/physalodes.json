It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons, which are a key feature in its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and alternate along the stems, while the flowers are usually trumpet-shaped and can be white, pink, or purple. Physalodes species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and ability to climb or trail."
