    "intro": "Phyllarthron arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils, typically found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology allows it to retain moisture in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species. Due to its limited habitat, Phyllarthron arenicola is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
