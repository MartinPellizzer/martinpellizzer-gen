    "intro": "Panicum extensum, commonly known as broad panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loose, feathery inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it often forms dense stands in wet environments. Panicum extensum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
