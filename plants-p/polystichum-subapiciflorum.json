    "intro": "Polystichum subapiciflorum, commonly known as the subapiciflorous woodfern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a slightly serrated margin. This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight."
