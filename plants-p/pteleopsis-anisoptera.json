    "intro": "Pteleopsis anisoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteleopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, often woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
