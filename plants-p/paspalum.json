    "intro": "Paspalum, commonly known as carpet grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, sandy soils. Many species of paspalum are used in turfgrass applications due to their durability and adaptability. The plants typically have narrow leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are also valued in ecological restoration projects for their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
