    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens proles salisii, commonly known as the salt marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
