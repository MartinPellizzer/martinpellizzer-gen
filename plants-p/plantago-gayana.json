    "intro": "Plantago gayana, commonly known as the African plantain or broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and healing properties."
