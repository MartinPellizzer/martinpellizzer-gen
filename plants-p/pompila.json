    "intro": "Pompila, commonly known as the common wasp, is a type of wasp that belongs to the family Vespidae. It is a solitary wasp, meaning it does not live in colonies like social wasps. The plant name \"Pompila\" is actually a misnomer, as it refers to the wasp rather than a botanical species. The confusion may arise from the similarity in name between the wasp and certain flowering plants. In botany, the term \"Pompila\" is not used to describe any known plant species."
