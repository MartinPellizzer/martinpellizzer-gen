    "intro": "Pouteria velutinicarpa, commonly known as the velvet-leafed soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that give way to large, spiky fruits resembling those of the soursop. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet, creamy pulp that is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
