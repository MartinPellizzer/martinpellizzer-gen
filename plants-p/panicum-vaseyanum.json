It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, feathery appearance and drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
