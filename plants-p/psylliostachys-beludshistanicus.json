    "intro": "Psylliostachys beludshistanicus, commonly known as the Beludshistan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
