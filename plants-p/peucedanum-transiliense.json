    "intro": "Peucedanum transiliense, commonly known as the Transilvanian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in meadows and woodland edges, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It produces small white to greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its range."
