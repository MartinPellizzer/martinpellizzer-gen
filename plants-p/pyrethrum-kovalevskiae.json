    "intro": "Pyrethrum kovalevskiae, commonly known as the Kovalevskaya pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow petals and a central disc. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has potential uses in natural pest control due to its pyrethrin content."
