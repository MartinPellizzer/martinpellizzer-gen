    "intro": "Polystachya fusiformis, commonly known as the fusiform bamboo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with erect, slender stems that often bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Polystachya fusiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
