    "intro": "Pilea micromeriifolia, commonly known as the miniature leaf pilea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely packed on short, sturdy stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. Its foliage is characterized by a smooth, waxy texture and a deep green color. Pilea micromeriifolia is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
