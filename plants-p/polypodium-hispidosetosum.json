    "intro": "Polypodium hispidosetosum, commonly known as the hairy-stalked polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a visually appealing addition to shaded garden settings."
