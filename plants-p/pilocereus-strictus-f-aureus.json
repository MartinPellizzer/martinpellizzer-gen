    "intro": "Pilocereus strictus f. aureus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It features a compact, branching structure with ribbed, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are predominantly yellow or golden in hue, which bloom during the warmer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The f. aureus form is distinguished by its more vibrant and extensive flowering compared to the typical species."
