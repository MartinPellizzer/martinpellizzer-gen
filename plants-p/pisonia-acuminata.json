    "intro": "Pisonia acuminata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red or orange bract clusters that resemble coral, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Pisonia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
