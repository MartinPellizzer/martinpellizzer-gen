    "intro": "Panicum ischnocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches, characteristic of the grass family. Panicum ischnocaulon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
