    "intro": "Polylepis australis var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often broader than those of other polylepis species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late winter or early spring. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for endemic wildlife."
