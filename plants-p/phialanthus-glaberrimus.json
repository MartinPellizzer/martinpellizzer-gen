    "intro": "Phialanthus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth phialanthus, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically small, leathery, and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
