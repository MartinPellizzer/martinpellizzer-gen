    "intro": "Prunus mespilifolia, commonly known as the white serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in the summer, often used in jams and pies. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and it has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Prunus mespilifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
