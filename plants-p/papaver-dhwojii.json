    "intro": "Papaver dhwojii, commonly known as the Kashmiri poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that resemble those of the opium poppy, though it does not produce the same alkaloids. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and has a short growing season, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other poppies, with a diameter of about 2 to 3 inches. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
