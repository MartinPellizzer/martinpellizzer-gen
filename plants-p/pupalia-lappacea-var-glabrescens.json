It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
