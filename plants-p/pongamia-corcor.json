    "intro": "Pongamia corcor, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, flat, pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. Pongamia corcor is known for its ability to thrive in dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for reforestation efforts. The seeds are often used for oil extraction, which has various industrial and agricultural applications."
