    "intro": "Palaquium, commonly known as the wax apple or yellow apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It includes over 150 species, most of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. Many species produce fruits that are small, round, and have a waxy, yellow or orange skin. These fruits are edible and are sometimes used in traditional medicine or as a source of natural dyes."
