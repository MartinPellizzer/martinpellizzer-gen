    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 pseudotomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and moist woodlands. Its fast growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental and reforestation purposes."
