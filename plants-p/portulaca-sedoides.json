    "intro": "Portulaca sedoides, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil. Portulaca sedoides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some areas."
