    "intro": "Paepalanthus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky pear or viscous pear, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in a thick, sticky substance that helps in trapping insects, which in turn provide nutrients to the plant. Paepalanthus viscosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
