    "intro": "Pleurothallis homalanthoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
