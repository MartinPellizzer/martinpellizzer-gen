    "intro": "Parosela wrightii, commonly known as Wright's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
