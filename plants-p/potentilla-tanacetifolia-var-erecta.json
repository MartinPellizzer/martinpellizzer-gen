    "intro": "Potentilla tanacetifolia var. erecta, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period."
