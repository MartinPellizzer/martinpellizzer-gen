    "intro": "Pelexia setacea, commonly known as the hairy pelexia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in moist environments. Pelexia setacea is typically found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions."
