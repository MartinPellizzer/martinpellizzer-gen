    "intro": "Pisophaca elongata, commonly known as the slender grass-vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pisophaca elongata is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
