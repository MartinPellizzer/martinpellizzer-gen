    "intro": "Pedicularis thamnophila, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes several parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. The plant's leaves are small and often clustered at the base, adapting to the cold, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat."
