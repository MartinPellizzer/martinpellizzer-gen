    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis f. subglabrescens, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to rocky and barren soils. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
