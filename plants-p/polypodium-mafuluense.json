    "intro": "Polypodium mafuluense, commonly known as the Mafulu polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinct, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. Polypodium mafuluense thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
