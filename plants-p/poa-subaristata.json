    "intro": "Poa subaristata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa subaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
