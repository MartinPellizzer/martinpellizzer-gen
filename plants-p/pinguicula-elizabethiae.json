    "intro": "Pinguicula elizabethiae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's butterwort, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
