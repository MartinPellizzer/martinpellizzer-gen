    "intro": "Pleurosoriopsis makinoi, commonly known as the Japanese moss fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to eastern Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
