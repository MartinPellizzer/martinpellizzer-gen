    "intro": "Pinus strobus f. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a cultivar of the eastern white pine characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with a conical shape and dense, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical eastern white pine. The cones are slender and reddish-brown, maturing within 18 to 20 months. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and as a Christmas tree. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
