    "intro": "Prosaptia venulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to regions in Africa and parts of Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
