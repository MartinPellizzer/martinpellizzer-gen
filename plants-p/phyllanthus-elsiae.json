    "intro": "Phyllanthus elsiae, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Phyllanthus elsiae is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse species with unique morphological features. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not extensively studied in modern scientific contexts."
