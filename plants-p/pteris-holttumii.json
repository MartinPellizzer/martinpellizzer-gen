    "intro": "Pteris holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris holttumii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
