    "intro": "Paspalum polo, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine texture, dense growth habit, and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it popular for lawns and turfgrass applications. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
