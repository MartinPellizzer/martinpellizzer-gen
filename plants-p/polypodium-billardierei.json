    "intro": "Polypodium billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium billardierei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
