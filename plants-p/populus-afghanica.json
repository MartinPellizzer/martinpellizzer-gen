    "intro": "Populus afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and along watercourses. Populus afghanica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
