    "intro": "Primula sikkimensis var. pseudosikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim primrose, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It features rosettes of basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cool, temperate gardens."
