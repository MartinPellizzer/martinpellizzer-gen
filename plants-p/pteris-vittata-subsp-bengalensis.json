    "intro": "Pteris vittata subsp. bengalensis, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of rapid growth, allowing it to spread easily in suitable conditions. The species is also noted for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
