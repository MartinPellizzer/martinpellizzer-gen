    "intro": "Poa rigidula, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
