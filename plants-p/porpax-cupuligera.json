    "intro": "Porpax cupuligera, commonly known as the cupuliferous liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its leafy shoots and small, cup-like structures called peristomes. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central stem and leaf-like lobes arranged in a spiral. It reproduces through spores released from the cup-like structures at the tips of its shoots. Porpax cupuligera is often found in rocky or forested areas where high humidity supports its growth."
