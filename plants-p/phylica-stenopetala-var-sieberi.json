It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity."
