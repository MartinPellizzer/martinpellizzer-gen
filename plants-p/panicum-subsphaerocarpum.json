    "intro": "Panicum subsphaerocarpum, commonly known as the spherical panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Panicum subsphaerocarpum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
