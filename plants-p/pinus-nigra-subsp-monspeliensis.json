    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. monspeliensis, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of other pine species. The cones of this plant are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. This subspecies is valued for its timber and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability."
