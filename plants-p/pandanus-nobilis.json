    "intro": "Pandanus nobilis, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette around the trunk, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to grow in coastal and saline environments. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many Pacific Island communities."
