    "intro": "Pleurothallis cardiothallis, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a unique heart-shaped lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
