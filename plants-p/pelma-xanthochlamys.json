    "intro": "Pelma xanthochlamys, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pelma, is a species of flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves, attracting various pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
