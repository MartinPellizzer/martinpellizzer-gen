    "intro": "Portulaca filifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf moss rose, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
