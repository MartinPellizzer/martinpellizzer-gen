It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green but may turn reddish in certain conditions. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. Its botanical characteristics make it an important part of the ecological interactions within its habitat."
