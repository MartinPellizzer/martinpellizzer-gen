    "intro": "Polycarpaea teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Island polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
