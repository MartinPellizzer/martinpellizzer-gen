    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heath and tundra habitats. Prunella vulgaris var. aleutica is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
