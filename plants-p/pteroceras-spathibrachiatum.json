    "intro": "Pteroceras spathibrachiatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
