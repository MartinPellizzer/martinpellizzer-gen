    "intro": "Pritchardia martii, commonly known as the Hawaiian silver sword, is a rare cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant is adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. It plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Pritchardia martii is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
