    "intro": "Phaeomeria speciosa, commonly known as the showy phaeomeria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its bright red or orange flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
