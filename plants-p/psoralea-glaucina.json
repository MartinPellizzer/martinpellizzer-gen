    "intro": "Psoralea glaucina, commonly known as the blue psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea glaucina is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in its native environment."
