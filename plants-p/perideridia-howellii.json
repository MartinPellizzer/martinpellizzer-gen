    "intro": "Perideridia howellii, commonly known as Howell's biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and can form a dense mat, which helps stabilize soil in its native range. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
