    "intro": "Panicum konaense, commonly known as Kona grass, is a native Hawaiian plant that thrives in coastal and lowland areas. It is a perennial grass with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of the Kona coast and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
