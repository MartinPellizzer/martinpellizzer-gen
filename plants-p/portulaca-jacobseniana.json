    "intro": "Portulaca jacobseniana, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday. Portulaca jacobseniana is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
