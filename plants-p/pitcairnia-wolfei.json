    "intro": "Pitcairnia wolfei, commonly known as the Woolly Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of trichomes on its leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Flowering occurs in the spring, producing vibrant red or orange inflorescences that attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
