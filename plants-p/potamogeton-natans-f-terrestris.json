    "intro": "Potamogeton natans f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial pondweed, is a variant of the aquatic plant Potamogeton natans. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical aquatic form. This subspecies often grows in shallow, still water or even in moist soil along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
