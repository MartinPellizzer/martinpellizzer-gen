It features a tall, narrow stem that bears a single, showy yellow or orange flower with a distinctive violet or purple center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a cluster of small, white, fragrant flowers at the base of the stem. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Pancratium tenuiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
