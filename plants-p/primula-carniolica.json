    "intro": "Primula carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture. Primula carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
