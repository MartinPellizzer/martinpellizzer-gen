    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent. This trait allows it to spread efficiently in suitable habitats. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences."
