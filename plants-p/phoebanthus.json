    "intro": "Phoebanthus, commonly known as the whitebeard bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. These plants are native to regions of Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Phoebanthus species often grow in woodland or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
