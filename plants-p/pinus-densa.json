    "intro": "Pinus densa, commonly known as the dense pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that are often elongated and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The bark of Pinus densa is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions."
