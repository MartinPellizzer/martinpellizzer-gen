    "intro": "Poa nemoralis proles glauca, commonly known as the glaucous wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. This coating, known as glaucous, helps to reduce water loss in arid or exposed environments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects."
