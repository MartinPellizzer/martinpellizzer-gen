It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
