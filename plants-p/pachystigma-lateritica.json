It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help store water, and its flowers are typically small and clustered. It produces showy, often colorful blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
