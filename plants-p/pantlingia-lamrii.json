    "intro": "Pantlingia lamrii, commonly known as the Lamrii's pantling, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pantlingia lamrii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
