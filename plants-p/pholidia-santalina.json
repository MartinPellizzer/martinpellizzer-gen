    "intro": "Pholidia santalina, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly fragrant aroma. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered in its natural habitat."
