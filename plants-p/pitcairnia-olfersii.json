    "intro": "Pitcairnia olfersii, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its fibrous roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. Pitcairnia olfersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
