    "intro": "Pitcairnia manabiana, commonly known as the Manab\u00ed pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in the wild."
