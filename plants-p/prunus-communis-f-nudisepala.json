    "intro": "Prunus communis f. nudisepala, commonly known as the naked-sepaled cherry, is a botanical variant of the common cherry. It is characterized by its lack of sepals, which are typically present in other Prunus species. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries. It is often found in woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its unique floral structure makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
