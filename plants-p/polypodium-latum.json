    "intro": "Polypodium latum, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks, tree trunks, or in shaded forest floors, thriving in humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium latum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in many botanical gardens."
