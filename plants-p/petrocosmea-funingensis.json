    "intro": "Petrocosmea funingensis, commonly known as the Funing petrocosmea, is a species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are usually ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
