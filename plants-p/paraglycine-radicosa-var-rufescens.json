    "intro": "Paraglycine radicosa var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed paraglycine, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand dry conditions."
