    "intro": "Padus ssiori, commonly known as the lesser whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow or red in the autumn. Padus ssiori is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
