    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pseudognaphalium domingense is adapted to tropical climates and exhibits drought-resistant features."
