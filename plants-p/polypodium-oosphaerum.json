    "intro": "Polypodium oosphaerum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium oosphaerum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
