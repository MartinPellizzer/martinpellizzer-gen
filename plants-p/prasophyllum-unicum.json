    "intro": "Prasophyllum unicum, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a single, slender, leafless stem that produces a single flower. The plant is characterized by its pale green to white, almost translucent flowers, which are often mistaken for ghostly apparitions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
