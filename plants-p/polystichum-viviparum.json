    "intro": "Polystichum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are typically released during the spring and summer months. One unique feature of this fern is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through the growth of plantlets on the rhizomes, a process known as viviparity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories."
