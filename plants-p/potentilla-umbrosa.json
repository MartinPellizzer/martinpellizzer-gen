    "intro": "Potentilla umbrosa, commonly known as shadow cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its stems are often reddish-brown and covered with fine, soft hairs. Potentilla umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability."
