    "intro": "Phaseolus macrorhynchus, commonly known as the large-seeded bean or the Andean runner bean, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean region, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several large, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in warm, tropical climates. Phaseolus macrorhynchus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
