    "intro": "Pedicularis gyroflexa subsp. gyroflexa, commonly known as the spiral monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped flowers that resemble a monkey's face, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
