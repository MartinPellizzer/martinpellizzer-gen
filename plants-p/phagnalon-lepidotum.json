    "intro": "Phagnalon lepidotum, commonly known as the woolly phagnalon, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain grassland ecosystems."
