    "intro": "Palmijuncus tenuis, commonly known as the slender palm, is a rare and endangered species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, low-growing palm characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clustered, spiny fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
