    "intro": "Pedicularis neolatituba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
