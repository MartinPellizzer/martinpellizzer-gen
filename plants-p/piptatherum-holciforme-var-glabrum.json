    "intro": "Piptatherum holciforme var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth meadowgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its smooth, glabrous appearance distinguishes it from other varieties within the Piptatherum genus."
