    "intro": "Parascopolia, commonly known as the sacred vine or ghost vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Parascopolia species are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are climbing plants that often grow along trees or shrubs, using their tendrils for support. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for traditional medicinal uses."
