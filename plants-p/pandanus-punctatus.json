    "intro": "Pandanus punctatus, commonly known as the spiked pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in small, white tubercles. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its fruits are edible and used in local cuisines. The species is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a common sight in mangrove and beach ecosystems."
