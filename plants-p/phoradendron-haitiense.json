    "intro": "Phoradendron haitiense, commonly known as Haitian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also contributing to the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even mortality."
