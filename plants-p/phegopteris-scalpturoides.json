    "intro": "Phegopteris scalpturoides, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The fronds are typically green and have a distinctive, veined appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
