    "intro": "Pavonia intermixta, commonly known as the mixed false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring sprawling stems and clusters of pink to red bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts, which are often the main attraction. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. Pavonia intermixta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
