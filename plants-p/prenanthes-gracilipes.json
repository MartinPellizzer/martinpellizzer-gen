    "intro": "Prenanthes gracilipes, commonly known as slender swampweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom in late summer. Prenanthes gracilipes plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
