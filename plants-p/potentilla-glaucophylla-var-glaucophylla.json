    "intro": "Potentilla glaucophylla var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucous cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
