It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments."
