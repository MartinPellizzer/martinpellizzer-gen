    "intro": "Polygala arabica, commonly known as the Arabian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Polygala arabica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
