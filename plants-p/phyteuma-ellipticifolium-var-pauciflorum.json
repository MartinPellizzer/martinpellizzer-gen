    "intro": "Phyteuma ellipticifolium var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
