    "intro": "Packera musiniensis, commonly known as the Sitka mountain aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads. Packera musiniensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
