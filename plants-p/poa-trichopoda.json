    "intro": "Poa trichopoda, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa trichopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
