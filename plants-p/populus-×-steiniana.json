    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 steiniana, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Populus deltoides and Populus tremuloides. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Populus \u00d7 steiniana is valued for its rapid growth and is used in reforestation and phytoremediation efforts."
