    "intro": "Polypodium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
