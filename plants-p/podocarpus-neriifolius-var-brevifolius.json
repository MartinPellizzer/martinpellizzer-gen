    "intro": "Podocarpus neriifolius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Christmas tree, is a species of evergreen coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones containing edible, fleshy seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. This variety is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its use in traditional medicine."
