    "intro": "Phreatia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower phreatia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy layer of the forest. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is usually pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter, which is crucial for its survival in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
