    "intro": "Potentilla simulatrix var. grossidens, commonly known as the broad-leaved potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are often larger than those of the typical variety. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens and landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
