    "intro": "Pleopeltis munchii, commonly known as the Munch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in moist, tropical climates."
