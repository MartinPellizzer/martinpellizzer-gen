It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in saline or coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and is often used for erosion control in coastal areas. Puccinellia poacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
