    "intro": "Pinus montana var. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray needles and conical shape, which make it a popular ornamental tree. The foliage retains its color throughout the year, giving it a distinct appearance in both winter and summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in high-altitude environments. This variety is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
