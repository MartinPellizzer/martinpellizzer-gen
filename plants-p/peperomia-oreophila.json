    "intro": "Peperomia oreophila, commonly known as the cloud forest peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and silver, which help it thrive in low-light, humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, followed by tiny, round berries. It is well adapted to shaded, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia oreophila is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
