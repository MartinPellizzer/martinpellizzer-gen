    "intro": "Pitcairnia pseudopungens, commonly known as the sword fern pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries like Ecuador and Peru. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a waxy, silver-green appearance. It produces striking orange or red flowers that emerge from the leaf rosette, often in late summer or early autumn."
