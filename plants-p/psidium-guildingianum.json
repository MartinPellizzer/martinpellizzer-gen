    "intro": "Psidium guildingianum, commonly known as the Chinese starfruit or golden carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which turns yellow when ripe, and its dense, glossy evergreen foliage. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It produces small, white flowers that give way to the edible, five-lobed fruit. Psidium guildingianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its flavorful, acidic fruit."
