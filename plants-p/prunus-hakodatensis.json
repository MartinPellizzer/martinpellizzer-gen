    "intro": "Prunus hakodatensis, commonly known as the Hakodate cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual display to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native region. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and turn a vibrant red in the fall. The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use."
