    "intro": "Pitcairnia schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
