    "intro": "Perityle halimifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf perityle, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branching and can form dense, compact shrubs that provide habitat for small animals. Perityle halimifolia is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
