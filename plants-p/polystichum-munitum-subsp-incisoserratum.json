    "intro": "Polystichum munitum subsp. incisoserratum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a compact, upright growth habit with lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a silvery underside. The fronds are characterized by their finely toothed margins, which give the plant its subspecies name, incisoserratum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to form dense, spreading colonies."
