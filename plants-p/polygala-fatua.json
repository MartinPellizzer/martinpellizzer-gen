    "intro": "Polygala fatua, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and parts of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Polygala fatua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
