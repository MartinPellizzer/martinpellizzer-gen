    "intro": "Psilotum complanatum, commonly known as the spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead possessing root-like structures called rhizomes and stem-like structures known as stolons. The plant has small, scale-like structures called sporophylls that bear sporangia, which produce spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Psilotum complanatum is considered a relic of early plant evolution, showcasing features similar to its ancient ancestors."
