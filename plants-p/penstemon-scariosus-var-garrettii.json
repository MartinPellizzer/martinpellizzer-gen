    "intro": "Penstemon scariosus var. garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to native gardens."
