    "intro": "Plantago alpina var. incana, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
