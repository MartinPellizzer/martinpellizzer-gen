    "intro": "Primula matthioli subsp. discolor, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom in early spring. This subspecies is characterized by its pale discoloration in the center of the flower, which distinguishes it from other Primula species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows."
