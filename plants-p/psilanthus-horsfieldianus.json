    "intro": "Psilanthus horsfieldianus, commonly known as the Horsfield's psilanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in small clusters, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
