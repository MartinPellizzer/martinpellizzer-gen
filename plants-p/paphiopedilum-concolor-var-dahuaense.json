    "intro": "Paphiopedilum concolor var. dahuaense, commonly known as the Dahua butterfly orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like petals and a distinctive, modified lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
