    "intro": "Polystichum acanthophyllum var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It features dark green, leathery, and serrated fronds that are typically arched or semi-upright. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded garden areas."
