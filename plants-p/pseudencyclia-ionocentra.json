    "intro": "Pseudencyclia ionocentra, commonly known as the Ionocentra cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudencyclia ionocentra is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
