    "intro": "Primula incisa subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a distinctive serrated margin that gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
