    "intro": "Phaeopappus dagestanicus, commonly known as the Dagestani brown pappus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and papery bracts. The plant features a short, woody stem with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive brownish pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
