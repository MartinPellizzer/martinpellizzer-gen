    "intro": "Polypodium viridulum, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Polypodium viridulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
