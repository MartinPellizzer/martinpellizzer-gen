    "intro": "Pteris desmedtii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a water lily, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water sources such as streams or marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats. Pteris desmedtii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in humid climates."
