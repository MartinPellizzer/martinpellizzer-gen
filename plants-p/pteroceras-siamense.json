    "intro": "Pteroceras siamense, commonly known as the Siam horned orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sensitive species in botanical conservation efforts."
