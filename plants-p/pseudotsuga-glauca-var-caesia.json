    "intro": "Pseudotsuga glauca var. caesia, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the white fir that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and blue-gray foliage, which results from a waxy cuticle and tightly packed leaves. The needles are short, stiff, and have a distinctive blue-green coloration due to a high concentration of flavonoids. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of coniferous species. This variety is native to specific regions of the western United States and thrives in cooler, moist environments."
