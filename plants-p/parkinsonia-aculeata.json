    "intro": "Parkinsonia aculeata, commonly known as the screwbean, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in dry landscapes across its range. Parkinsonia aculeata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility."
