    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 mariorika, commonly known as the Mariorika spruce, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between Picea abies (Norway spruce) and Picea omorika (Serbian spruce). It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and dense, pyramidal shape, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The cones are typically pendulous, with elongated scales, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, it thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
