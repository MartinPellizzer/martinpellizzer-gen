    "intro": "Parietaria caespitosa, commonly known as the common wall-rocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Parietaria caespitosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
