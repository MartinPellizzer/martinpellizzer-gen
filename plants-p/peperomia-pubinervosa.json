It features glossy, dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch, with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
