    "intro": "Pyrus platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that ripen in late summer. Its fruit is typically small to medium in size with a sweet, aromatic flavor. Pyrus platyphylla is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its edible fruit in its native habitat."
