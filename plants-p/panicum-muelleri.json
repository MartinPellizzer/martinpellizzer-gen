    "intro": "Panicum muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
