    "intro": "Pimpinella araucana, commonly known as the Andean cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year producing flowers and seeds. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy, triangular capsule, which aids in seed dispersal."
