    "intro": "Platanthera fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like leaves and a long, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. The species is also notable for its fragrant blooms, which attract various pollinators."
