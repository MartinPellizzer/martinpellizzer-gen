    "intro": "Psidium emilhasslerianum, commonly known as the Emilio Hassler guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to guavas, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is sometimes grown in gardens and conservation areas."
