    "intro": "Pouzolzia ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy pouzolzia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Pouzolzia ramosissima is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
