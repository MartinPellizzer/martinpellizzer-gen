    "intro": "Phanera posthumi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Phanera posthumi is critically endangered and highly sought after in conservation efforts."
