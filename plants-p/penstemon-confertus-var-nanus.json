It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
