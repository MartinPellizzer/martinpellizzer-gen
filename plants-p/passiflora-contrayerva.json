    "intro": "Passiflora contrayerva, commonly known as the Yaruca passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces bright orange or yellow berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in small, hooked spines. Passiflora contrayerva is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
