    "intro": "Phymatodes myriocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Phymatodes myriocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
