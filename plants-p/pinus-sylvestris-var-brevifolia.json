    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The needles are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Scots pine, giving it a distinct appearance. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions. This variant is often found in forests and mountainous regions, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological balance."
