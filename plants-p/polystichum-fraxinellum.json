    "intro": "Polystichum fraxinellum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are rich in golden-yellow spores, which are released in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Polystichum fraxinellum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
