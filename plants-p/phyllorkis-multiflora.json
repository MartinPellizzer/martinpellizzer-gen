    "intro": "Phyllorkis multiflora, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought. Phyllorkis multiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
