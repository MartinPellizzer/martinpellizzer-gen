    "intro": "Psychotria petiolosa, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by berries that turn red when mature. Psychotria petiolosa is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it is important to note that some species within the Psychotria genus contain toxic compounds, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
