It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and profuse displays of white or pale pink blossoms in spring. The plant features small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The compact form makes it suitable for smaller spaces while maintaining the beauty of its floral display."
