    "intro": "Polypodium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved wall fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, ovate, and slightly toothed leaves that are usually arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Polypodium obtusifolium reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds."
