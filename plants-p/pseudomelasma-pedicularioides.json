    "intro": "Pseudomelasma pedicularioides, commonly known as the false melasma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
