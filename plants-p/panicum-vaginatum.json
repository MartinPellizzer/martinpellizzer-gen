    "intro": "Panicum vaginatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Panicum vaginatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
