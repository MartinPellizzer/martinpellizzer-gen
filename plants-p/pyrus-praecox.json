It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Pyrus praecox is valued for its ornamental value and its use in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
