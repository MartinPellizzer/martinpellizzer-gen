    "intro": "Phlebodium pseudoaureum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tree-like structure with a central caudex and multiple fronds that radiate outward. Its leaves are typically leathery and can have a golden or variegated appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
