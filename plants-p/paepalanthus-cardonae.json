    "intro": "Paepalanthus cardonae, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of the Canary Islands. It is a tall, columnar cactus that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It has adapted to its harsh environment through its thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaves. Paepalanthus cardonae is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a striking feature of its native desert landscapes."
