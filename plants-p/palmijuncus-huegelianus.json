It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. It is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid climates."
