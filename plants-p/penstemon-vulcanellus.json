    "intro": "Penstemon vulcanellus, commonly known as the volcanic penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Penstemon vulcanellus is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
