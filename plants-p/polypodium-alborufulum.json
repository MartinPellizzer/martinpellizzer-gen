    "intro": "Polypodium alborufulum, commonly known as the white-brown fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to pale brown in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually over time. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
