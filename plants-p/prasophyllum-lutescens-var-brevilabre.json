It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland and heathland. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of yellow-green flowers. Its flowers are small and have a distinctive, spurred lip. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
