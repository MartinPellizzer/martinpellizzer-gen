    "intro": "Phyllocactus cartagensis var. refractus, commonly known as the Cartagena reflex cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
