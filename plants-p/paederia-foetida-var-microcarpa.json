    "intro": "Paederia foetida var. microcarpa, commonly known as the stink vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a notable species in ecological studies."
