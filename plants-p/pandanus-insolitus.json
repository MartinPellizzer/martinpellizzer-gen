    "intro": "Pandanus insolitus, commonly known as the rare or uncommon pandanus, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their durability and fibrous texture. The species is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
