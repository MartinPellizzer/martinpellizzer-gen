    "intro": "Picris crepioides, commonly known as common cudweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, with a serrated edge, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
