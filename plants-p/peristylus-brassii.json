    "intro": "Peristylus brassii, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling small bells. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peristylus brassii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
