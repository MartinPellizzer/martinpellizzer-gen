    "intro": "Planchonella reticulata, commonly known as the rough-leaved hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
