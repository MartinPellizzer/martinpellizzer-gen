    "intro": "Plectronia obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf plectronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
