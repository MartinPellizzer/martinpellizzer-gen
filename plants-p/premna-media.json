    "intro": "Premna media, commonly known as Chinese nettle or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
