It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause vomiting and has led to its common name. It is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
