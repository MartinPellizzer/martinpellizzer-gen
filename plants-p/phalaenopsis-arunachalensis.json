    "intro": "Phalaenopsis arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and erect, leafy stems that bear clusters of flowers. The plant produces showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
