    "intro": "Physodia capitata, commonly known as the yellow evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, black seeds that are dispersed by wind. Physodia capitata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
