    "intro": "Pleomele viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered pleomele, is a striking member of the Agavaceae family native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of greenish-white flowers that are highly visible against the foliage, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
