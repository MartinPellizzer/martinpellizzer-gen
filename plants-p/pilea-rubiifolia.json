    "intro": "Pilea rubiifolia, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a striking houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent red veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by pale green, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea rubiifolia is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
