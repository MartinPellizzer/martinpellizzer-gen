    "intro": "Phlomis brunneogaleata, commonly known as the brownish-hairy phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in sunny grasslands or open woodlands. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers during the summer months. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
