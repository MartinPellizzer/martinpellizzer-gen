    "intro": "Pristiglottis integra, commonly known as the slender thread fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has a compact, creeping growth habit with slender, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for study in botany and horticulture."
