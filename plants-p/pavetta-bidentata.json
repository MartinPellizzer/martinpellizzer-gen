    "intro": "Pavetta bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed pavetta, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with two small teeth at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often accompanied by a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds. Pavetta bidentata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
