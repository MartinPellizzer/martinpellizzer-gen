    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid globose cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense, spiny exterior with short, thick ribs that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is prized for its unique shape and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
