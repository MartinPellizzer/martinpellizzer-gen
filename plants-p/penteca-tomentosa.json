    "intro": "Penteca tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly penteca, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, leaves and stems, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
