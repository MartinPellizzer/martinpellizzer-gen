    "intro": "Pentacalia ricoensis, commonly known as the Rico's pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. It has hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss, and its structure is compact to withstand strong sea breezes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
