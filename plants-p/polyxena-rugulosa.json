    "intro": "Polyxena rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
