    "intro": "Pandanus misimaensis, commonly known as the Misima pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the island of Misima in Papua New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the plant. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
