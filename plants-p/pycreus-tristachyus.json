    "intro": "Pycreus tristachyus, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
