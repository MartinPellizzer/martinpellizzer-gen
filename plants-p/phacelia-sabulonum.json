    "intro": "Phacelia sabulonum, commonly known as sand phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and open grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Phacelia sabulonum is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
