    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf snowbank rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in harsh, cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in colder regions."
