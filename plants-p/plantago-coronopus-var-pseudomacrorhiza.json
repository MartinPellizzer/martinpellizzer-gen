    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. pseudomacrorhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This variant is notable for its slightly larger leaves compared to the typical form of Plantago coronopus."
