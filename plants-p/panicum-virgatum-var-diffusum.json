    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. diffusum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species valued for its ecological and agricultural benefits. It is a warm-season perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces tall, upright stems with feathery plumes that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it effective for erosion control and wildlife habitat. The foliage is typically bluish-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
