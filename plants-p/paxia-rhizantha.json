    "intro": "Paxia rhizantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often resembling the shape of a ghostly figure. Its unique growth habit and striking appearance make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paxia rhizantha is listed as an endangered species."
