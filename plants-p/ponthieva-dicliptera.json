    "intro": "Ponthieva dicliptera, commonly known as the African button fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, button-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form compact clumps. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Ponthieva dicliptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
