    "intro": "Pleione nitida, commonly known as the silver-veined pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
