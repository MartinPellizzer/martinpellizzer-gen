    "intro": "Polygala rugosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Its scientific name reflects its rugged appearance, with \"rugosa\" referring to the rough, hairy texture of its stems and leaves. Polygala rugosa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
