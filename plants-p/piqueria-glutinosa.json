    "intro": "Piqueria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky piqueria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous secretions that coat its leaves and stems, a feature that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are surrounded by pale green bracts. Piqueria glutinosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water environments."
