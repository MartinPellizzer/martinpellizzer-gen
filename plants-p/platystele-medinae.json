    "intro": "Platystele medinae, commonly known as the Medina's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a single, fragrant flower. Native to the cloud forests of Colombia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele medinae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
