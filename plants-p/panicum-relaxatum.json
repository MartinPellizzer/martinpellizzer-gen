    "intro": "Panicum relaxatum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, arching stems with narrow, silky-textured leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-brown flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which appear in late summer to early fall. Panicum relaxatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
