    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. farinosa, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps insulate the plant in cold environments. This variety is particularly adapted to alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its frost-resistant nature and early blooming period make it a notable component of high-altitude flora."
