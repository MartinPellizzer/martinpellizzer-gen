It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies adds to its ecological value."
