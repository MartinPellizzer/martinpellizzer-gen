    "intro": "Pyrus rivularis, commonly known as the river pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, yellowish-green fruits that are similar in appearance to pears but are typically smaller and more acidic. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus rivularis is often found in moist, riparian habitats and is adapted to thrive in wetland environments."
