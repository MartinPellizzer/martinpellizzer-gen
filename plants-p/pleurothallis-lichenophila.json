    "intro": "Pleurothallis lichenophila, commonly known as the lichen-like orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, often clustered stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
