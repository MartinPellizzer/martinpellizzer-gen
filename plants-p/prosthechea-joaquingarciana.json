    "intro": "Prosthechea joaquingarciana, commonly known as the Joaquim Garc\u00edan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant's leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Prosthechea joaquingarciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
