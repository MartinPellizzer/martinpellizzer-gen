    "intro": "Pancratium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican yellow bulbous, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a tall, narrow stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and a bulbous base that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Pancratium mexicanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
