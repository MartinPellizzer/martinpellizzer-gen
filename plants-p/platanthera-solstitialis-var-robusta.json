    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink floral spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, loose raceme and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This variety is closely related to other members of the Platanthera genus and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
