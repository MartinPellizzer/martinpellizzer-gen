    "intro": "Poa pumilio, commonly known as the \"snow grass,\" is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Poa pumilio plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
