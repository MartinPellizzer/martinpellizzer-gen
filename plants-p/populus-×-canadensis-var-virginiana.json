    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. virginiana, commonly known as the American poplar, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with vertical fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures. This species is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
