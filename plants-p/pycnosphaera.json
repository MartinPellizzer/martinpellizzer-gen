    "intro": "Pycnosphaera, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, clustered inflorescences that resemble coral, hence their common name. Pycnosphaera species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They produce small, often showy flowers that can be white, yellow, or red, and they are known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
