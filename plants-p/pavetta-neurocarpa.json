    "intro": "Pavetta neurocarpa, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Pavetta neurocarpa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
