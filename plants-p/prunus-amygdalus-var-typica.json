    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. typica, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of drupes containing the edible almond seeds. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, gray bark with a pleasant almond scent. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with a serrated margin. The fruit is harvested when the outer hull splits open, revealing the hard, brown shell enclosing the kernel."
