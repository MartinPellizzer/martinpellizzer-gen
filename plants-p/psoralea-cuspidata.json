    "intro": "Psoralea cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a pubescent surface, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Psoralea cuspidata is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
