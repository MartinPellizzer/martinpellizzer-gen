    "intro": "Pulmonaria \u00d7 norica, commonly known as the European lungwort, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble the texture of lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pulmonaria \u00d7 norica is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
