    "intro": "Pleuremidis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pleuremidis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
