    "intro": "Psoralea lanceolata var. stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked psoralea, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. This species is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
