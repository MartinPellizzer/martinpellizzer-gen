    "intro": "Pellaea mucronata subsp. mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green and glossy. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
