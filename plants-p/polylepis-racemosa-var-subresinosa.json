    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. subresinosa, commonly known as the resinous polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, resinous bark, which gives it its common name and provides some resistance to pests and diseases. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various endemic species."
