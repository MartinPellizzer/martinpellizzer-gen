    "intro": "Phellopterus macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted phellopterus, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its fibrous root system and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
