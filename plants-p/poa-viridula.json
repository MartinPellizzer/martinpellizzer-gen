    "intro": "Poa viridula, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Poa viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand foot traffic."
