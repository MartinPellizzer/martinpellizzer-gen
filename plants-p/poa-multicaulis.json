    "intro": "Poa multicaulis, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per branch. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Poa multicaulis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
