    "intro": "Pilosella glomerata subsp. calomelana, commonly known as the clustered hairvetch, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small yellow flowers that are followed by rounded, greenish-brown fruits. Pilosella glomerata subsp. calomelana is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can sometimes become invasive."
