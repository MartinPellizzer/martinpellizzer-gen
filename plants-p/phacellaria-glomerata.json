    "intro": "Phacellaria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating shoots that bear small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in dense clusters, giving the plant its common name. Phacellaria glomerata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms."
