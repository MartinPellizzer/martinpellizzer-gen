It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa unioloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
