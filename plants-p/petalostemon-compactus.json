    "intro": "Petalostemon compactus, commonly known as the dwarf petalostemon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Botanically, it belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms."
