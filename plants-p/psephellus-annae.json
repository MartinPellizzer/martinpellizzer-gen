    "intro": "Psephellus annae, commonly known as the Annas' rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Psephellus annae is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh habitat."
