    "intro": "Pinosia ortegioides, commonly known as the Ortegui's pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of the Pinaceae family. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinosia ortegioides is considered a rare and endangered species."
