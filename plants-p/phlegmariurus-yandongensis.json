    "intro": "Phlegmariurus yandongensis, commonly known as the Yandong clubmoss, is a rare species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant is native to China, specifically found in the Yandong region of Yunnan Province, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Phlegmariurus yandongensis reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
