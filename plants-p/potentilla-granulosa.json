    "intro": "Potentilla granulosa, commonly known as the granulate cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense, upright growth habit. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered with a fine, granular texture that gives it its common name. Potentilla granulosa is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
