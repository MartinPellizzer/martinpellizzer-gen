    "intro": "Persea carolinensis f. pubescens, commonly known as the Florida persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth-leaved form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to reddish fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and have a rough, textured surface. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is often used in culinary applications."
