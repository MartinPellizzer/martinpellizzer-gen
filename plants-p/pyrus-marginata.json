It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Pyrus marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its attractive foliage and winter interest."
