    "intro": "Peucedanum karataviense, commonly known as Karatavi wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to yellowish flowers. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
