    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 subhirtella var. stellata, commonly known as the stellate cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is prized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rounded form, making it suitable for small gardens or containers. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy surface and turn red in the fall. The fruit is a small, edible cherry that ripens in late summer, though it is often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption."
