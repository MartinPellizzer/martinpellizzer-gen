    "intro": "Pongamia mitis var. xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert pongam, is a variant of the pongam tree native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its seeds produce a dark, oily pulp that is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
