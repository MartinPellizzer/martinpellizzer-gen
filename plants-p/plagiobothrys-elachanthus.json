    "intro": "Plagiobothrys elachanthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
