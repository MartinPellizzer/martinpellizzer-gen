    "intro": "Phragmotheca siderosa subsp. siderosa, commonly known as the ironbark phragmotheca, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears iron-gray, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
