    "intro": "Poa sharpii, commonly known as the Sharp's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa sharpii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
