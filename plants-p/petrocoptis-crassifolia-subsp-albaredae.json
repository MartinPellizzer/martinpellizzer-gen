    "intro": "Petrocoptis crassifolia subsp. albaredae, commonly known as the white-flowered rock-cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecific name, *albaredae*, refers to the pale coloration of its flowers. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh mountain environments."
