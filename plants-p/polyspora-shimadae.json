    "intro": "Polyspora shimadae, commonly known as the Shimada's polypore, is a rare fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, sponge-like porous structure on its cap, which is a key feature of polypores. This fungus typically grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate forest ecosystems. Its spore-producing surface is usually pale yellow to brown, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
