    "intro": "Pleopeltis tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air. The leaves are usually light green and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
