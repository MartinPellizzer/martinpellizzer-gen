    "intro": "Polypodium hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium hancockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
