It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The plant features slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
