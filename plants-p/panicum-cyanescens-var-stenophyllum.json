    "intro": "Panicum cyanescens var. stenophyllum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of blue-gray florets that turn reddish-brown as they mature. The plant typically grows in open areas, including roadsides and disturbed soils, and is well adapted to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced under stress. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
