    "intro": "Pleopeltis buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are often leathery and covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Pleopeltis buchananii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
