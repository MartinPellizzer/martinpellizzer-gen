    "intro": "Psychotria alata, commonly known as the devil's vine or cohoba, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by black, egg-shaped berries. It contains various alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has psychoactive properties. Due to its toxic nature and hallucinogenic compounds, it is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests and is used in traditional spiritual practices."
