    "intro": "Prunus tomentosa, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit with grayish-white pubescent bark that becomes smoother with age. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. Prunus tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
