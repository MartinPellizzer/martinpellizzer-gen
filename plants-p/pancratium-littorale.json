    "intro": "Pancratium littorale, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. Pancratium littorale thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its resilience to salt and wind makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
