    "intro": "Pavetta luzonica, commonly known as the Malayan pavetta, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, elliptic leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes and bloom during the rainy season. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the natural habitat."
