    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cowparsnip, is a compact, herbaceous plant characterized by its small stature and clustered growth habit. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. This subspecies is notable for its reduced size compared to the typical form, making it an attractive and distinctive addition to gardens and natural habitats."
