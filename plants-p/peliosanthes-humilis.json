    "intro": "Peliosanthes humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil and is protected in its native habitat."
