    "intro": "Pedicularis lanata subsp. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Yukon and Northwest Territories in Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Yukon beardtongue is an important plant for pollinators, particularly bumblebees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
