    "intro": "Prunus ilicifolia, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, cherry-like fruits that are edible but generally not considered highly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions. Prunus ilicifolia is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
