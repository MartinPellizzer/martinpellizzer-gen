    "intro": "Paspalum laticulmum, commonly known as broad-ribbed paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Paspalum laticulmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
