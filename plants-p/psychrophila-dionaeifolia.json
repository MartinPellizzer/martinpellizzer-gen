    "intro": "Psychrophila dionaeifolia, commonly known as the frostleaf, is a rare flowering plant adapted to cold environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine and subarctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
