    "intro": "Petasites ovatus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and its yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and alpine meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Petasites ovatus is notable for its ability to tolerate cold climates and is often found in areas with high humidity."
