    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the spherical fruit pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched and bear small, oval leaves. The plant produces distinctive spherical, yellowish fruits that are adapted for floating and dispersal. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft, muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its dense growth, it can form dense vegetation mats that provide habitat for aquatic life but may also impact water flow and clarity."
