    "intro": "Plantago ignota, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
