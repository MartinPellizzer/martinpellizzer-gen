    "intro": "Pyrus meridionalis proles baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii pear, is a rare subspecies of the European pear native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped fruits that ripen to a yellowish-green color. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, white flowers in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
