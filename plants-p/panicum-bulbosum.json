    "intro": "Panicum bulbosum, commonly known as bulbous panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Panicum bulbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
