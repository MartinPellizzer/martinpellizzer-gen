It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
