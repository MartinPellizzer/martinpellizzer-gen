It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
