It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory habitats within tropical rainforests. Psychotria eickii is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
