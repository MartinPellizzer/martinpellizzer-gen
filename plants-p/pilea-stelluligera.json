    "intro": "Pilea stelluligera, commonly known as the star-shaped pilea, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea stelluligera is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
