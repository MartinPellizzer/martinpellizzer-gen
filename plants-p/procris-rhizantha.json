    "intro": "Procris rhizantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Procris rhizantha is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
