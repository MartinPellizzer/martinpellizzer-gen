    "intro": "Phaca decumbens, commonly known as the creeping phaca, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs. Phaca decumbens is often found in sandy or rocky soils in grasslands and open woodlands."
