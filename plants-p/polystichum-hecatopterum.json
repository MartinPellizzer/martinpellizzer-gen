    "intro": "Polystichum hecatopterum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking silver-white fronds, which are covered in a fine, powdery bloom called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and developing into mature leaves over the course of a year. The botanical structure of Polystichum hecatopterum includes a rhizomatous root system and a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules."
