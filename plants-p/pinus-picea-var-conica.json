    "intro": "Pinus picea var. conica, commonly known as the dwarf Alberta spruce, is a compact, coniferous evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small garden spaces and rock gardens."
