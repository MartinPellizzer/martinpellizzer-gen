    "intro": "Pisophaca, commonly known as the false thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs with rough, often spiny leaves. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads, and they are usually yellow or pale green in color. Pisophaca species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed or marginal habitats."
