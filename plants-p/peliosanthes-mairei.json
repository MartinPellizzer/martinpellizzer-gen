    "intro": "Peliosanthes mairei, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
