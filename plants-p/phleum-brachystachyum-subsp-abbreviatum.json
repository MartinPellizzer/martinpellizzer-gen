It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
