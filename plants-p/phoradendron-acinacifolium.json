    "intro": "Phoradendron acinacifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces small, white, waxy flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other animals. The species is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate high salinity and windy conditions."
