    "intro": "Pinalia aporoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense, white, sponge-like tissue. Its flowers are small, white, and resemble those of the orchid family, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
