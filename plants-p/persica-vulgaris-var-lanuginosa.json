    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its dense, fuzzy hair covering its stems and leaves. This variety is native to regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a rough texture due to the fine pubescence. The flowers are usually pink to white, and the fruits are similar to common peaches but often have a more pronounced woolly coating. It is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild, sweet fruit."
