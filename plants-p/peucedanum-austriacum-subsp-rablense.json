It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The subspecies rablense is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the main species."
