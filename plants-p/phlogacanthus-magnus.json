    "intro": "Phlogacanthus magnus, commonly known as the giant flameleaf, is a strikingly large herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep red or orange color, especially when exposed to full sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can grow quite deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its size and vibrant foliage, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
