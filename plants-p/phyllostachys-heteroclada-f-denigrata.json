    "intro": "Phyllostachys heteroclada f. denigrata, commonly known as the dark-stemmed bamboo, is a variant of the bamboo species Phyllostachys heteroclada. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its lighter green leaves. This plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It grows as a clump-forming bamboo, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. The dark pigmentation of its stems is due to a higher concentration of tannins, making it a unique ornamental plant in horticulture."
