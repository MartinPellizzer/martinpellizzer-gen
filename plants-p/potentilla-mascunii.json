    "intro": "Potentilla mascunii, commonly known as the Tibetan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Potentilla mascunii is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
