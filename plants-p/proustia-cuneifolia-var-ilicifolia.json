It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates."
