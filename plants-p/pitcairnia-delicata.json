    "intro": "Pitcairnia delicata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a velvety, silver-green coating, giving the plant its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. This species is well adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in humid, well-draining environments."
