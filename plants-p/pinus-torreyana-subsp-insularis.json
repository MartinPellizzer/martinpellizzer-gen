    "intro": "Pinus torreyana subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz Island pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves and a distinctive cone structure. The plant thrives in coastal habitats, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of conservation interest. The subspecies plays a vital role in the unique ecosystems of its native islands."
