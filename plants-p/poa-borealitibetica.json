    "intro": "Poa borealitibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan boreal grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern China. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Poa borealitibetica plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
