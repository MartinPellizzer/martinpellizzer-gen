    "intro": "Pandanus pseudolais, commonly known as the false pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its fibrous leaves are valued for their strength and durability, making them useful in weaving and construction. Pandanus pseudolais thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
