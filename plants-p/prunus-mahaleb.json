    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in landscaping due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Prunus mahaleb is also notable for its ability to thrive in urban environments."
