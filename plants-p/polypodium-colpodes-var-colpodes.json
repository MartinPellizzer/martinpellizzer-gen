    "intro": "Polypodium colpodes var. colpodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, with the upper portion being more deeply lobed than the lower. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
