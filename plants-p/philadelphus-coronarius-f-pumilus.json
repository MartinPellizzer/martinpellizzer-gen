    "intro": "Philadelphus coronarius f. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf goldbloom, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant, white to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its growth habit is more compact compared to the typical Philadelphus coronarius. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
