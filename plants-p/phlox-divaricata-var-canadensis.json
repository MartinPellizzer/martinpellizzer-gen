It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
