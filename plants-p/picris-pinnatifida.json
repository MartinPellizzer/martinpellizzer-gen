    "intro": "Picris pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender sow-thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Picris pinnatifida is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
