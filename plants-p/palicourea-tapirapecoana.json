    "intro": "Palicourea tapirapecoana, commonly known as the Brazilian moonseed, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Palicourea tapirapecoana is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
