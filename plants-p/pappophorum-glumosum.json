It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are equipped with a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
