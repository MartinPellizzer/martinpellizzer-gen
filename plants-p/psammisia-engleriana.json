    "intro": "Psammisia engleriana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas. Psammisia engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
