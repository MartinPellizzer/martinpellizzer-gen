It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various habitats."
