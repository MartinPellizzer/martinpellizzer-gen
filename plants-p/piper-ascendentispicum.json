It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with elongated stems that ascend through a system of aerial roots. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a glossy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and the plant produces tiny, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and local cuisine."
