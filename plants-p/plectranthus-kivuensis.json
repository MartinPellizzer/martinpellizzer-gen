    "intro": "Plectranthus kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu plectranthus, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
