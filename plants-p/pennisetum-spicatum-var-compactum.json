    "intro": "Pennisetum spicatum var. compactum, commonly known as purple muhly, is a compact, ornamental grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features upright, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a striking purple hue in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale pink to white flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
