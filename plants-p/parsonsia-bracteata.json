It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in clusters during the holiday season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Parsonsia bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
