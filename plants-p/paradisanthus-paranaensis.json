    "intro": "Paradisanthus paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana river orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for tropical greenhouses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
