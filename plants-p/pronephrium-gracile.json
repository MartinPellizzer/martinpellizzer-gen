    "intro": "Pronephrium gracile, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pronephrium gracile thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
