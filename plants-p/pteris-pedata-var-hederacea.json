    "intro": "Pteris pedata var. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a compact, low-growing fern that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant features rhombic to ovate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance, and its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded garden areas. The varietal form, hederacea, is distinguished by its broader fronds compared to the typical species."
