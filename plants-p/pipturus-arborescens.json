It is characterized by its opposite branching pattern and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
