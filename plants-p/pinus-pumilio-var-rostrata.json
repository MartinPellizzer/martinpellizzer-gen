    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated cones and small, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree grows in harsh, alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. Its cones mature in the second year and release seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in mountain ecosystems. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in association with other high-altitude conifers."
