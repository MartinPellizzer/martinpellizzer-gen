    "intro": "Polypodium savaiense, commonly known as the Savai\\'s fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the island of Savai\\'i in Samoa. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and spore-bearing structures. Polypodium savaiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
