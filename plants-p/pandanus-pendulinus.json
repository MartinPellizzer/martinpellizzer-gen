    "intro": "Pandanus pendulinus, commonly known as the hanging pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like leaves that hang from the plant's stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions."
