    "intro": "Pedilonum cochleatum, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive spiral growth pattern. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate. The lichen's morphology includes a complex arrangement of lobes and areolae, contributing to its intricate appearance. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Due to its specialized growth form and ecological role, Pedilonum cochleatum is an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions."
