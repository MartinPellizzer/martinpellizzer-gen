    "intro": "Phyllorkis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which typically feature a combination of white and pink or purple hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each growth producing a cluster of leaves and a flowering spike. Its flowers are small to medium in size and are often arranged in a loose inflorescence. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
