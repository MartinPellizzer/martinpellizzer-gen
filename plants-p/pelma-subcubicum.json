    "intro": "Pelma subcubicum, commonly known as the diamond leaf plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive diamond-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
