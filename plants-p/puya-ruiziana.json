    "intro": "Puya ruiziana, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom for only a few weeks, making it a rare and short-lived spectacle. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure. Puya ruiziana is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
