The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
