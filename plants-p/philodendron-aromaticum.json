It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with light green and white patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aromatic leaves give it the common name, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
