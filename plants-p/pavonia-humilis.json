    "intro": "Pavonia humilis, commonly known as the common pavonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, hairy leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Pavonia humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
