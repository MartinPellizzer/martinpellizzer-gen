    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf moth orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, rounded leaves that give it its name. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with showy, moth-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its long-lasting blooms. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
