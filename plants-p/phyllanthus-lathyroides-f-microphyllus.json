    "intro": "Phyllanthus lathyroides f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved wood rose, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are characterized by a dense, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The botanical structure of this plant reflects adaptations to its native environment, making it a resilient species in diverse ecological settings."
