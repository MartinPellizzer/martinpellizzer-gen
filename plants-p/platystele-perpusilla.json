    "intro": "Platystele perpusilla, commonly known as the miniature ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Platystele perpusilla is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
