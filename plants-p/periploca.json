    "intro": "Periploca, commonly known as the silver vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing or shrub-like growth habit and is native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a silvery or glaucous appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are usually small, clustered in umbels, and can be white, pink, or yellow, depending on the species. Periploca species are often used in traditional medicine and have some ornamental value in horticulture."
