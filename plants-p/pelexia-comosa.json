    "intro": "Pelexia comosa, commonly known as the woolly pelexia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pelexia comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
