    "intro": "Primula uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It produces a single, showy flower that is typically pink or white, with a distinctive spurred petal at the base. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
