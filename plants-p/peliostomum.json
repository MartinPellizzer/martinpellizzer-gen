    "intro": "Peliostomum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Peliostomum species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, playing a role in both ecological and ornamental value."
