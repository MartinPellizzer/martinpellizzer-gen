    "intro": "Pentadiplandra brazzeana var. brazzeana, commonly known as the African violet or the African violet tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and Western Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a tree-like structure with a smooth, grayish bark and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are elliptical and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
