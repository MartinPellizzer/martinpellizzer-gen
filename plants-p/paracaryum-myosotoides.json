    "intro": "Paracaryum myosotoides, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Paracaryum myosotoides is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
