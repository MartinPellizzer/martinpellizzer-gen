    "intro": "Pouteria tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis sapodilla, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its fruit, similar to a sapodilla, is edible and has a sweet, creamy texture when ripe. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
