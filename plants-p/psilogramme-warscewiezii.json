    "intro": "Psilogramme warscewiezii, commonly known as the Warshaw's psilogramme, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
