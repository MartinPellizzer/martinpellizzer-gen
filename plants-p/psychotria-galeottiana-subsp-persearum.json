    "intro": "Psychotria galeottiana subsp. persearum, commonly known as the \"Peruvian Psychotria,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests. It is notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, similar to those found in other members of the Psychotria genus. Its botanical significance is partly due to its role in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
