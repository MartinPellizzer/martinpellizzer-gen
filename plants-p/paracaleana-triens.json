It is native to Australia and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
