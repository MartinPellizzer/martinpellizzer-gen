    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. magyarica, commonly known as the Hungarian silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
