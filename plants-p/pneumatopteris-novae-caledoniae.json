    "intro": "Pneumatopteris novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia moonlight fern, is a unique fern species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically pale green to silvery in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pneumatopteris novae-caledoniae is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and distinctive morphology."
