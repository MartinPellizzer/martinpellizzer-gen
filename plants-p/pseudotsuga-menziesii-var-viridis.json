It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically light green and slightly twisted. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires. This variety is known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological and economic value."
