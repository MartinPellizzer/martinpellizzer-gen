    "intro": "Primula parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a compact rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
