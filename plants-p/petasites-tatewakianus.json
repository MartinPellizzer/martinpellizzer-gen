    "intro": "Petasites tatewakianus, commonly known as the Japanese buttercup fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
