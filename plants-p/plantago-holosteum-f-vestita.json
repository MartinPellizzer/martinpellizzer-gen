    "intro": "Plantago holosteum f. vestita, commonly known as the velvet plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its dense, soft pubescence on the leaves. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, velvety hairs, which give the plant its distinctive texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, and the seeds are enclosed in a capsule. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on skin irritations."
