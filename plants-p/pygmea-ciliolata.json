    "intro": "Pygmea ciliolata, commonly known as the slender ciliate grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, linear leaves that have fine, ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
