    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. viminalis, commonly known as the Douglas fir var. viminalis, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are needle-like, typically dark green on top and whitish underneath, and they are arranged spirally along the shoots. The cones are cone-shaped, with prickly bracts, and they mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and evergreen foliage."
