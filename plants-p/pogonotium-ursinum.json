It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, reddish stems that resemble a bear's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along streambanks. Pogonotium ursinum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
