It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its finely serrated, needle-like leaves that are typically white or grayish-white underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a dark brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
