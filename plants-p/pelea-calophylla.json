    "intro": "Pelea calophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf pelea, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. Pelea calophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and resilience."
