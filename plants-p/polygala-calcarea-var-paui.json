    "intro": "Polygala calcarea var. paui, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to white, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
