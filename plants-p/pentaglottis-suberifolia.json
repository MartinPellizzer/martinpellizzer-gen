    "intro": "Pentaglottis suberifolia, commonly known as the woolly pentaglottis, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
