    "intro": "Parietaria velutina, commonly known as velvet ground ivy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early spring. Parietaria velutina is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
