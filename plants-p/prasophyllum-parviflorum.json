    "intro": "Prasophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered leek orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
