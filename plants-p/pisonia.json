These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. They are typically shrubs or small trees with showy, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough or hairy texture. The fruits are capsules that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
