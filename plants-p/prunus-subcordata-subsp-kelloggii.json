    "intro": "Prunus subcordata subsp. kelloggii, commonly known as the Kellogg\u2019s cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cherry varieties."
