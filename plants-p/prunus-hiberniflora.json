    "intro": "Prunus hiberniflora, commonly known as the winter-flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red or black berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for colder climates. Its unique flowering period makes it a valuable addition to gardens seeking early-season color."
