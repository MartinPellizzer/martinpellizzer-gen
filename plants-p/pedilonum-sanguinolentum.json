    "intro": "Pedilonum sanguinolentum, commonly known as the crimson-footed vine, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vivid red stems and heart-shaped leaves. Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires careful handling due to its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
