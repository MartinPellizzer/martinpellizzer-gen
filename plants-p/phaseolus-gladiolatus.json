    "intro": "Phaseolus gladiolatus, commonly known as the scarlet runner bean, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, hairy stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers, followed by pods containing edible beans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the seeds are typically yellow or brown. This species is valued both for its ornamental flowers and its edible beans, which are cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions."
