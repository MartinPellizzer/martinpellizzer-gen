    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. obovoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its elongated, obovate needles that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its cones are usually small and often remain attached to the branches for a prolonged period. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
