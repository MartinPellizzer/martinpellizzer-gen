    "intro": "Polypodium anisomeron var. abortivum, commonly known as the aborted polypody, is a variant of the polypody fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, lanceolate shape and is characterized by its compact growth habit. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in specific microhabitats within tropical rainforests."
