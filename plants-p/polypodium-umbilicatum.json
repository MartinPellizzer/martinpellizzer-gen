    "intro": "Polypodium umbilicatum, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium umbilicatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
