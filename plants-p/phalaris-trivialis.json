    "intro": "Phalaris trivialis, commonly known as common barnyard grass, is an annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
