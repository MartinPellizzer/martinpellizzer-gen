    "intro": "Pimpinella taurica, commonly known as the Crimean cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and shrublands. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Pimpinella taurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
