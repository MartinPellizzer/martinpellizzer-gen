    "intro": "Peperomia reflexa var. emarginata, commonly known as the notched peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
