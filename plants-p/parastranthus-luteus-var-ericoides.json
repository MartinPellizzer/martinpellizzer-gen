It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
