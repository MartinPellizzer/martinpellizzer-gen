    "intro": "Pellaea limitanea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Mexico. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich environments, often growing on cliff faces or in crevices where moisture is retained. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
