    "intro": "Plantago densiflora, commonly known as denseflower plantain, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are typical of the Plantaginaceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
