    "intro": "Pilea peploides var. major, commonly known as the velvet pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, velvety foliage with a rich green hue, giving it a lush, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a slight waxy coating that enhances its visual appeal. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal maintenance requirements."
