    "intro": "Polygonum maritimum var. roseum, commonly known as the pink knotweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and along the shores of tidal flats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
