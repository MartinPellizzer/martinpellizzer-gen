It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
