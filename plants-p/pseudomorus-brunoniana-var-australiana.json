    "intro": "Pseudomorus brunoniana var. australiana, commonly known as the southern sandalwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. This variety is valued for its essential oils and has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
