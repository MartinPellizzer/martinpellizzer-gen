    "intro": "Pholidota caduca, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, fragrant foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
