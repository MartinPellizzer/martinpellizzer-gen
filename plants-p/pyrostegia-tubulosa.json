    "intro": "Pyrostegia tubulosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Pyrostegia tubulosa is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets in suitable conditions."
