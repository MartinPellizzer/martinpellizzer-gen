    "intro": "Phyllodes flexuosa, commonly known as the warty phyllodinea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the genus Phyllodes, which is part of the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant is characterized by its unique, flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. These phyllodes are typically narrow and curling, adapting to the harsh, dry environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds."
