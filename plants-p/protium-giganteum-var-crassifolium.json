It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, fragrant fruits. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a resin that has been historically used in various traditional applications. This variant is distinguished by its robust foliage and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
