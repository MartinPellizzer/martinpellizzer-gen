    "intro": "Phaca elongata var. minor, commonly known as the slender phaca, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers make it a distinctive yet understated addition to gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
