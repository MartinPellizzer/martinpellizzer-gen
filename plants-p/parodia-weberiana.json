    "intro": "Parodia weberiana, commonly known as the Weber's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
