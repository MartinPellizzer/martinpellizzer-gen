    "intro": "Paspalum glabratum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinators. Paspalum glabratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
