    "intro": "Pneumatopteris incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are typically bright green and can develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss in shallow waters."
