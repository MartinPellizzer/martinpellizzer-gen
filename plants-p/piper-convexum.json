    "intro": "Piper convexum, commonly known as the convexum pepper or the mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Andes Mountains. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a distinctive aromatic scent. The small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature."
