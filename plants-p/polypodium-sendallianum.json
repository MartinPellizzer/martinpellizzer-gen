    "intro": "Polypodium sendallianum, commonly known as the Sendall's water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
