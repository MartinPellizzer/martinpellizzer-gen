    "intro": "Phyllanthus maguirei, commonly known as the Hawaiian billy goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats across the islands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Phyllanthus maguirei is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment, with a deep root system to access water. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native insects and birds."
