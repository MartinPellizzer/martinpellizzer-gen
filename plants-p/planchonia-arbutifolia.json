    "intro": "Planchonia arbutifolia, commonly known as the Australian heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is adapted to sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in coastal environments. Planchonia arbutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
