    "intro": "Pteris comans, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically divided into segments that form a dense, overlapping pattern, giving the plant a lush appearance. Pteris comans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
