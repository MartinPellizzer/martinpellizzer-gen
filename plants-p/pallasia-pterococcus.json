    "intro": "Pallasia pterococcus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many countries."
