    "intro": "Piper miniatum var. hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy little pepper, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
