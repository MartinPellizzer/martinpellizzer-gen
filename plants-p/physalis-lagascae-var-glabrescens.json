It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous calyx that encloses the small, yellow-orange berries. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The fruit matures to a bright red color, resembling a small tomato, and is often used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
