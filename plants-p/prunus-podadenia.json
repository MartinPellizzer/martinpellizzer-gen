    "intro": "Prunus podadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Prunus podadenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
