    "intro": "Petrophile filifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Petrophile filifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
