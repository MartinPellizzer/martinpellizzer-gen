    "intro": "Pitcairnia andreana, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
