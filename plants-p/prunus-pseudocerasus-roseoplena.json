    "intro": "Prunus pseudocerasus roseoplena, commonly known as the double-flowering Chinese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its ornamental, double-flowered blossoms that appear in early spring, adding a striking visual display. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn, contributing to its seasonal appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. The fruit, though edible, is not as prominent as the showy flowers, which are the main attraction of this plant."
