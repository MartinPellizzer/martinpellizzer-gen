    "intro": "Philodendron arborescens, commonly known as the climbing philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant has aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to supports, making it ideal for trellises or hanging baskets. Its stems are thick and can grow quite long, sometimes reaching several meters in height. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
