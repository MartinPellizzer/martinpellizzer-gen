    "intro": "Pteroglossaspis ecristata f. flava, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pteroglossaspis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its unique yellow floral coloration, which distinguishes it from other members of the species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane regions. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetric, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
