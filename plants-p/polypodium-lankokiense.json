    "intro": "Polypodium lankokiense, commonly known as the Lankatilaka fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
