    "intro": "Polycnemum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive forked leaves that split into two equal parts, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
