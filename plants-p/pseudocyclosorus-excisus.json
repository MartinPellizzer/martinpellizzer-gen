    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus excisus, commonly known as the excised cyclosorus, is a rare fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
