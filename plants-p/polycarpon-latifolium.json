    "intro": "Polycarpon latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf sandparsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a taproot system and produces basal leaves that are typically broad and lobed. The plant blooms with small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
