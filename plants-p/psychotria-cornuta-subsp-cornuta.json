    "intro": "Psychotria cornuta subsp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin. The plant is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped bracts that enclose the flowers, giving it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphytic shrub, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, and the plant produces small, dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals."
