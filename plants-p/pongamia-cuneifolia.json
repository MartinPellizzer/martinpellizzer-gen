    "intro": "Pongamia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pongam, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oblong, woody pods containing several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Pongamia cuneifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
