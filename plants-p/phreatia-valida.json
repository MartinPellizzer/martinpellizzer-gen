    "intro": "Phreatia valida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white or pale pink flowers. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Phreatia valida is considered endangered in many regions."
