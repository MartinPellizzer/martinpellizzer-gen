    "intro": "Polypodium insigne, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored powder, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium insigne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
