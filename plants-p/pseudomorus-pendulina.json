    "intro": "Pseudomorus pendulina, commonly known as the hanging false morus, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescences. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, though it does not produce true fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
