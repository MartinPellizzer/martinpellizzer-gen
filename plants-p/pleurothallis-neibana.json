    "intro": "Pleurothallis neibana, commonly known as the Neibana orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
