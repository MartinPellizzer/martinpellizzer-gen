    "intro": "Poa pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower structures. Poa pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
