    "intro": "Polystichum underwoodii, commonly known as the Underwood's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Polystichum underwoodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its dense, foliage."
