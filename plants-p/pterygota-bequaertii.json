    "intro": "Pterygota bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's pteridium, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive pattern of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Pterygota bequaertii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying fern biodiversity."
