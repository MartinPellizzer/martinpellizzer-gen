    "intro": "Pinus rigida subsp. serotina, commonly known as the Appalachian pine, is a subspecies native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 4 to 6 inches long. The cones of this subspecies are usually retained on the tree for several years before opening, a trait known as serotiny. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This resilient tree plays an important role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native range."
