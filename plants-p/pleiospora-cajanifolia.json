    "intro": "Pleiospora cajanifolia, commonly known as the coffee leaf rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects coffee plants. It belongs to the fungal family Mycosphaerellaceae and is characterized by its ability to produce rust-like lesions on the leaves of its host. The disease is caused by the infection of the fungal spores, which spread through wind and rain, leading to significant yield losses in coffee crops. The plant's botanical features are less relevant, as it is not a plant but a pathogen. It thrives in warm and humid climates, making it a major threat to coffee production in tropical regions."
