    "intro": "Phyllodes brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features narrow, elongated phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified stems. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Phyllodes brevipes is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the inland regions of Australia."
