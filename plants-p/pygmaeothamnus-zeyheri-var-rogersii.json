    "intro": "Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri var. rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' pygmy thamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. This variety is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens."
