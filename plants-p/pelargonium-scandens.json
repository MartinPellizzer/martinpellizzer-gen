    "intro": "Pelargonium scandens, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble ivy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Pelargonium scandens is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to cascade attractively."
