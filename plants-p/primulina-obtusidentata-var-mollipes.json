It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
