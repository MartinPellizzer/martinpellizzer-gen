    "intro": "Poa fauriei, commonly known as Faurie's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Poa fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, attractive lawns."
