    "intro": "Pedilanthus myrtifolius, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of its leaves. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for various health purposes."
