    "intro": "Pavetta crassipes, commonly known as broad-leaved pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Pavetta crassipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
