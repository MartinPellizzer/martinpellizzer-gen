    "intro": "Prasium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy prasium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, preferring cooler and more humid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles."
