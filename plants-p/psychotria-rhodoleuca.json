    "intro": "Psychotria rhodoleuca, commonly known as the red-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its striking red leaves, which contrast with its small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Psychotria rhodoleuca is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
