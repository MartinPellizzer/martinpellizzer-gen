    "intro": "Phytoxis acidissima, commonly known as the fiery thorn, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and vibrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its unique chemical composition includes a high concentration of alkaloids, which contribute to its toxic properties and medicinal significance. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is protected in several conservation areas."
