    "intro": "Pteris presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. Pteris presliana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
