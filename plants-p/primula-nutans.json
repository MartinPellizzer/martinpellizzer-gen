    "intro": "Primula nutans, commonly known as the drooping primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Primula nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
