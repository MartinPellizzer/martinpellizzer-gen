    "intro": "Primula pinnatifida subsp. apoclita, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy, and often reddish leaves that form a dense basal layer. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
