    "intro": "Pityrogramma flexilis, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pityrogramma flexilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
