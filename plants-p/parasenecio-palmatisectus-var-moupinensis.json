    "intro": "Parasenecio palmatisectus var. moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin's palmleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
