    "intro": "Polygonum molle var. rude, commonly known as red root or red stem smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright, branched stems that are typically reddish in color, especially when mature. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. This plant is often found in wet or disturbed soils, such as along stream banks or in fields."
