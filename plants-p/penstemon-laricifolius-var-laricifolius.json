    "intro": "Penstemon laricifolius var. laricifolius, commonly known as the white penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, resembling those of a fir tree, which gives it its species name. It is a valuable plant for pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
