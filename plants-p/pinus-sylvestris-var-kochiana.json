    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. kochiana, commonly known as the Scots pine variety Kochiana, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are usually small and have a distinctive shape, with scales that open to release seeds. This variety thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
