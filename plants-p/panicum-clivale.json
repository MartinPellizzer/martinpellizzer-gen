    "intro": "Panicum clivale, commonly known as cliff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of spikelets, giving it its scientific name. Panicum clivale is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
