    "intro": "Phoradendron trinervium var. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. This species is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic and other parts of the Greater Antilles."
