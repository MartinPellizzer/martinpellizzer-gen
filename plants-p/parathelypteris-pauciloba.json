    "intro": "Parathelypteris pauciloba, commonly known as the few-leaved water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, lance-shaped outline and a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
