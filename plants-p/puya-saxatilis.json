    "intro": "Puya saxatilis, commonly known as the Andean rock fern, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya saxatilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
