    "intro": "Polycycnis annectans, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade for aquatic life and help regulate water temperature. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Polycycnis annectans plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
