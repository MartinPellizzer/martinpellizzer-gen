    "intro": "Pleurothallis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and its intricate, spiraling inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with three distinct lobes on each petal, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pleurothallis trilobata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
