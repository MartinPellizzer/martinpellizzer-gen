    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black pine, is a subspecies of the laricio pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The cones are usually small and have a distinctive shape, with scales that open to release the seeds. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the Mediterranean forest ecosystems."
