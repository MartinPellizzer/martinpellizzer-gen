    "intro": "Parkinsonia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey acacia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for ferns due to their delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in xeriscaping and native landscaping."
