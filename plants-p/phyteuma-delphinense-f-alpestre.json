    "intro": "Phyteuma delphinense f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
