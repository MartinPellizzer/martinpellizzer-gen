    "intro": "Panicum harleyi, commonly known as the Harley panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
