    "intro": "Pinguicula bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps in water retention and enhances its ability to capture prey. It blooms with small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months. Pinguicula bakeriana is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it an efficient predator in its native habitat."
