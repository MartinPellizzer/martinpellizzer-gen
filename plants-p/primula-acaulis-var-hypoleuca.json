    "intro": "Primula acaulis var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-leaved primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, pale green to white leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The variety is characterized by its reduced floral coloration compared to other Primula species, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
