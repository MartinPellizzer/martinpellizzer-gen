    "intro": "Polypodium atrovirens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
