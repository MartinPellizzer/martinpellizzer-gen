    "intro": "Pinguicula moranensis, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
