    "intro": "Prozetia, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is native to regions of North America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Prozetia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
