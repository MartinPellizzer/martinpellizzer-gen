    "intro": "Peperomia piperorum, commonly known as the pepper plant or pepper shrub, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly pubescent, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
