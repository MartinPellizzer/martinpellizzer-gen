    "intro": "Pescatoria coelestis, commonly known as the celestial seaflower, is a rare aquatic plant found in shallow coastal waters. It possesses delicate, translucent blue petals that shimmer under sunlight, giving it its celestial name. The plant thrives in brackish environments, where it absorbs nutrients from both freshwater and saltwater. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes the sediment and supports marine life. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is considered a keystone species in its habitat."
