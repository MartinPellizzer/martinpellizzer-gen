    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. glauciphyllum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a variant of switchgrass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually appealing in landscapes. The plant is a warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy seeds that mature in late summer. This variety is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
