    "intro": "Pombalia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled pombalia, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its long, slender stamens, which can extend several centimeters beyond the petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists studying pollination mechanisms in tropical flora."
