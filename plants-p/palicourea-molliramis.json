It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking violet to blue berries that appear in clusters, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Palicourea molliramis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
