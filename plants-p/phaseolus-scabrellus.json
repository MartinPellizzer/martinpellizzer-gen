    "intro": "Phaseolus scabrellus, commonly known as the rough-phaseolus, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, often branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
