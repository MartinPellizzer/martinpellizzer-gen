It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, grayish-green leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
