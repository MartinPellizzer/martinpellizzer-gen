    "intro": "Polypodium macrum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
