    "intro": "Platanthera holmboei, commonly known as the Holmboe's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and elongated, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
