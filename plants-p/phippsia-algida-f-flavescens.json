    "intro": "Phippsia algida f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered form of the alpine phippsia, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
