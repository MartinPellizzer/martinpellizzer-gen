    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 illyricum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or upright, depending on the cultivar. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are a distinctive feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and visual interest to shaded garden spaces."
