    "intro": "Platymitra, commonly known as the \"star lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. Platymitra species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. They are herbaceous perennials that often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the flowers are borne on tall, slender stems."
