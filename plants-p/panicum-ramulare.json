    "intro": "Panicum ramulare, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale blue to silver flowers, which are often mistaken for cotton due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Panicum ramulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
