    "intro": "Pisonia mollis, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, white, silky flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting birds and insects. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. Pisonia mollis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
