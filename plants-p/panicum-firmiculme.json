    "intro": "Panicum firmiculme, commonly known as the stiff panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow,\u575a\u97e7 (stiff) leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
