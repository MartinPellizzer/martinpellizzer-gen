    "intro": "Pteris cuspigera, commonly known as the serrate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Pteris cuspigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
