    "intro": "Pteris mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris mauritiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
