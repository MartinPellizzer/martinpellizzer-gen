    "intro": "Pilea simplex, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to China. It features rosettes of glossy, rounded, dark green leaves that are slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by pale green berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular indoor plant. Pilea simplex is easy to care for and is often propagated through stem cuttings."
