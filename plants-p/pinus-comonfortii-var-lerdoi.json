    "intro": "Pinus comonfortii var. lerdoi, commonly known as the Lerdo pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
