    "intro": "Palisota micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Palisota micrantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
