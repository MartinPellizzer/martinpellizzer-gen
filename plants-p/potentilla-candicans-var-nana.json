    "intro": "Potentilla candicans var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in harsh, well-drained soils. The botanical name reflects its close relationship to the species *Potentilla candicans*, with the varietal name *nana* referring to its dwarf stature."
