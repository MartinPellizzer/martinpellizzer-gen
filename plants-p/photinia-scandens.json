    "intro": "Photinia scandens, commonly known as the red tip photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red at the tips during the growing season. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia scandens is relatively low maintenance but can be susceptible to certain pests and diseases if not properly cared for."
