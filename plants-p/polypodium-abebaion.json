    "intro": "Polypodium abebaion, commonly known as the African cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, wiry rhizome. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Polypodium abebaion is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
