It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, producing tiny, three-lobed berries. Polygonum imberbe is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions."
