    "intro": "Petunia heterophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf petunia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Petunia heterophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
