    "intro": "Pyrus albicans, commonly known as the white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically pale green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish-green pomes that ripen in late summer. Pyrus albicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
