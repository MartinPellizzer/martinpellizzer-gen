    "intro": "Populus simonii var. griseoalba, commonly known as the gray-white poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and landscape gardening."
