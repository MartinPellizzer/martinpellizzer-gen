    "intro": "Papaver exile, commonly known as the rare Himalayan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Papaver exile is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known species like the opium poppy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
