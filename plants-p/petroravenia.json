    "intro": "Petroravenia, commonly known as the rock raspberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Petroravenia lanata, which is native to the southern United States and Mexico. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, thorny stems, and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered with a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The fruit is a small, red, berry-like structure that ripens in the fall and is often used in local cuisine or traditional medicine."
