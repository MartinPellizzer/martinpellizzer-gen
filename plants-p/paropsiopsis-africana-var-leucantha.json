    "intro": "Paropsiopsis africana var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered paropsiopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
