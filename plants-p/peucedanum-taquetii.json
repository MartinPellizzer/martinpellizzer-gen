    "intro": "Peucedanum taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant features tall, slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
