    "intro": "Polylepis tomentella subsp. nana, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a shrub-like species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather and herbivory. This subspecies plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat, supporting a variety of endemic flora and fauna."
