    "intro": "Psilostrophe gnaphalodes var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful, wind-swaying foliage."
