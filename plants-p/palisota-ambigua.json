    "intro": "Palisota ambigua, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in disturbed areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with climbing or trailing growth habits."
