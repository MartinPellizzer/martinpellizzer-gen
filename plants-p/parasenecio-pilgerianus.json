    "intro": "Parasenecio pilgerianus, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Parasenecio pilgerianus is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
