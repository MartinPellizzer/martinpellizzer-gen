    "intro": "Palmorchis silvicola, commonly known as the forest palm orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, stout rhizome and a single, upright stem topped with a dense cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, often growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
