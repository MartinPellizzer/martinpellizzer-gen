    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. dentata, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found along shorelines, dunes, and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This hardy species is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
