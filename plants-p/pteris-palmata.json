    "intro": "Pteris palmata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris palmata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
