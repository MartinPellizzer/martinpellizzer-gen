    "intro": "Pteris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan water fern, is a species of fern native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Pteris hainanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
