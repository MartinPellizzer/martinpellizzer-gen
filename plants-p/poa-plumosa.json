    "intro": "Poa plumosa, commonly known as the feathery bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, Poa plumosa is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
