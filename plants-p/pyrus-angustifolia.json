    "intro": "Pyrus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 feet and features slender, upright branches with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The narrowleaf pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
