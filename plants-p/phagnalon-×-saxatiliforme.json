    "intro": "Phagnalon \u00d7 saxatiliforme, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming in the summer months. It is native to regions with Mediterranean climates and is often found on limestone or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
