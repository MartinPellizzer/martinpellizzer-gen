    "intro": "Parodia otuyensis, commonly known as the Otuyense Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
