    "intro": "Pentaspadon, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Pentaspadon species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. They are sometimes considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
