    "intro": "Pseudo-gunnera, commonly known as the \"false gunnera,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, broad leaves that can reach several feet in diameter, often with a waxy surface. They are native to South America and are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Pseudo-gunnera species are perennial, with a stout, woody stem that supports their massive foliage. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often green or reddish in color, and appear in late spring or early summer."
