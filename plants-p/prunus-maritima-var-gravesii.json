    "intro": "Prunus maritima var. gravesii, commonly known as the coastal cherry or beach cherry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. The plant has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
