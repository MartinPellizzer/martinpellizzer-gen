    "intro": "Pedicularis hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the appearance of lice, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, typically at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
