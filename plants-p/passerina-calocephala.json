It is characterized by its distinctive red head and throat, contrasting with its gray body. The species is typically found in open woodland and savanna habitats, where it forages for insects. Its diet consists mainly of small invertebrates, which it captures by gleaning from branches and foliage. The bird's vocalizations are complex and varied, often used for territorial defense and mate attraction."
