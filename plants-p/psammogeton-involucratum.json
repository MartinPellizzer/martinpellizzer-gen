    "intro": "Psammogeton involucratum, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass with a fibrous root system adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Psammogeton involucratum is often found in dunes and coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
