    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. subobliqua, commonly known as the suboblique white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the standard white spruce. The cones of this form are often pendulous, hanging downward from the branches, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in mountainous or alpine regions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
