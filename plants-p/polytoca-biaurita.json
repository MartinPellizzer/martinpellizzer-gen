    "intro": "Polytoca biaurita, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure with two prominent, horn-like projections. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction, Polytoca biaurita is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
