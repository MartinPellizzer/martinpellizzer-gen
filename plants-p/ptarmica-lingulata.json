    "intro": "Ptarmica lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters. Ptarmica lingulata thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a key component of alpine ecosystems."
