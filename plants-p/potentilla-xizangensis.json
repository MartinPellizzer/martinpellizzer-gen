It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing yellow or white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
