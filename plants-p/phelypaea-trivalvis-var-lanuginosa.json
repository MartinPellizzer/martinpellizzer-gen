    "intro": "Phelypaea trivalvis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
