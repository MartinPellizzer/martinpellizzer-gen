    "intro": "Polypodium microchasmum, commonly known as the narrow-crested wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Polypodium microchasmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
