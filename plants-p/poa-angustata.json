    "intro": "Poa angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Poa angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
