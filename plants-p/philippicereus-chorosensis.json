It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, fleshy stems. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
