    "intro": "Planchonella serpentina, commonly known as the serpent tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its potential use in traditional medicine."
