    "intro": "Peristylus aliformis, commonly known as the winged grass, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, wing-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often concealed within the foliage. Peristylus aliformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
