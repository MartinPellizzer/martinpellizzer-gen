    "intro": "Pitcairnia micheliana, commonly known as the Michel's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its cloud forest habitat. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection from herbivores. Pitcairnia micheliana is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
