It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Psidium ovalifolium is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
