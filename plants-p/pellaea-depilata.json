    "intro": "Pellaea depilata, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of hair, though the name \"naked\" may refer to the absence of spore-bearing structures on the fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. Pellaea depilata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
