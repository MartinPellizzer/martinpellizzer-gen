    "intro": "Pedicularis aequinoctialis, commonly known as the summer snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes spurred petals that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant's ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils is due to its hemiparasitic nature, allowing it to draw nutrients from nearby host plants."
