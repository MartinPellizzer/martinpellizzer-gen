    "intro": "Pteroceras fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rosette-like structure with closely packed, fleshy leaves that are often green or reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and contain spores. Pteroceras fasciculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
