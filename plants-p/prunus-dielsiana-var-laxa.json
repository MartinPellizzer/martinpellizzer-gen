    "intro": "Prunus dielsiana var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
