It consists of approximately 120 species, predominantly found in the Americas, with a few species in Australia. These plants are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Phoebe species often thrive in moist, acidic soils and are commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and coastal areas. They play an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
