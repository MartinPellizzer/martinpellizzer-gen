    "intro": "Psammisia glandulolaminata, commonly known as the glandular laminate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Psammisia glandulolaminata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
