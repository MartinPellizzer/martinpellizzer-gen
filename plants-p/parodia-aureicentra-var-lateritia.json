    "intro": "Parodia aureicentra var. lateritia, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a ghostly appearance, especially when viewed from above. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
