    "intro": "Platylepis scripta, commonly known as the script lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like morphology. It typically grows on bark, wood, and soil surfaces, forming dense, cushion-like patches. The thallus is green to yellowish-green, with a smooth, leathery texture and a finely wrinkled surface. It is characterized by its intricate, script-like patterns on the upper surface, which give it its common name. This lichen is often found in humid, temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution."
