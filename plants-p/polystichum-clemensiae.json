    "intro": "Polystichum clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive silvery or whitish bloom on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Polystichum clemensiae is valued for its elegant foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded environments with minimal maintenance."
