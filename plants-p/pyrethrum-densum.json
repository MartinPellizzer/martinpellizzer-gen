    "intro": "Pyrethrum densum, commonly known as the dense pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insect-repelling properties. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pyrethrum densum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of natural insecticides."
