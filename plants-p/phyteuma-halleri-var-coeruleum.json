    "intro": "Phyteuma halleri var. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool and sunny conditions."
