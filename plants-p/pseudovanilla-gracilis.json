    "intro": "Pseudovanilla gracilis, commonly known as the slender vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and produces fragrant, vanilla-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often climbing on trees or other vegetation. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use compared to true vanilla species."
