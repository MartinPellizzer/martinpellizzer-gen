    "intro": "Polygonum breviarticulatum, commonly known as the short-articulated knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are alternate, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum breviarticulatum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
