    "intro": "Phoradendron glyptoneurum, commonly known as the Caribbean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Pseudoceraria*, through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on its host for survival."
