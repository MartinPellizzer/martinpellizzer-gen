    "intro": "Prevostea mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 Forest Fern, is a rare fern species native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
