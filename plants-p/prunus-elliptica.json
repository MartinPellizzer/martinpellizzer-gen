    "intro": "Prunus elliptica, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of China. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of renewal and transience in Japanese culture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
