    "intro": "Poa intrusa, commonly known as the invasive poa, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Poa intrusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation, making it a concern in ecological management."
