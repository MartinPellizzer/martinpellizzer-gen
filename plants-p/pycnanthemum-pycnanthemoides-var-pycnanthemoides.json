    "intro": "Pycnanthemum pycnanthemoides var. pycnanthemoides, commonly known as sweetwood, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland borders or wet meadows. Its fragrance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
