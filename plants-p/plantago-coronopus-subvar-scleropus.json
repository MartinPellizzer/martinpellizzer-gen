    "intro": "Plantago coronopus subvar. scleropus, commonly known as the hard-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
