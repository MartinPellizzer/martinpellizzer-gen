    "intro": "Polypodium convolutum, commonly known as the curled polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are somewhat fibrous and can form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sori."
