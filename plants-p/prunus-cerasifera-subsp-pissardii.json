    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subsp. pissardii, commonly known as the Pissard cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental and edible plant in gardens. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to the common cherry species."
