    "intro": "Phanerophlebia macrosora, commonly known as the giant fan-leaf orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often waxy leaves that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks, allowing it to thrive in canopy layers where it can access light. Due to its rarity and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
