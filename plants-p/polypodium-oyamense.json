    "intro": "Polypodium oyamense, commonly known as the Japanese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow, and often pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium oyamense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
