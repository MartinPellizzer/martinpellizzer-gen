It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
