    "intro": "Pernettya brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cowberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
