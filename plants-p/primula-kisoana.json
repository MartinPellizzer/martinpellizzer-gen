    "intro": "Primula kisoana, commonly known as the Kisoan primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and features basal rosettes of oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, usually blooming in early spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
