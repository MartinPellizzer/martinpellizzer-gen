    "intro": "Poa ovina, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Poa ovina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
