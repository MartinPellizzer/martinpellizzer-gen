    "intro": "Pulicaria fetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Despite its pungent odor, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
