    "intro": "Phreatia taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Taiwan. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Phreatia taiwaniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
