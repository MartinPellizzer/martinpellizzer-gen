    "intro": "Pigea curvifolia, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Pigea curvifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
