    "intro": "Pogonia tetrandra, commonly known as the pink fairy lantern, is a species of orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking pink and purple flowers that resemble small lanterns, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Pogonia tetrandra is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
