    "intro": "Ptilanthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing candelabra, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and dense, woody stems that often form a tangled mass. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a distinctive scent. Ptilanthus scandens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
