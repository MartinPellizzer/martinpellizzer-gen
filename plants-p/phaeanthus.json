    "intro": "Phaeanthus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Phaeanthus species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
