    "intro": "Poa helmsii, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Poa helmsii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
