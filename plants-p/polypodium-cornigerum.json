    "intro": "Polypodium cornigerum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium cornigerum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
