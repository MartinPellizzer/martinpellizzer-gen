    "intro": "Poaephyllum podochiloides, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
