    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its single, showy flower instead of the typical multiple flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant features a slender, upright stem with palmately lobed leaves and produces vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive blackish center. It is known for its medicinal properties, including use in pain relief and as a source of opium alkaloids. However, due to its potential for misuse, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
