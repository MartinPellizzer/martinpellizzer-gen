    "intro": "Polypodium cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and sword-like fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
