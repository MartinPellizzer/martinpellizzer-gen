    "intro": "Pulsatilla grandis f. oligopetala, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports its single, usually pale yellow or white flower. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. This variety is notable for its reduced petal number, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical form of Pulsatilla grandis."
