    "intro": "Primula nivalis subsp. turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it is often found at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
