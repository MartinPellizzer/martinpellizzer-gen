The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
