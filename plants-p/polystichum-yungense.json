    "intro": "Polystichum yungense, commonly known as Yungense Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
