It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, broad leaves that are often clustered in dense rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
