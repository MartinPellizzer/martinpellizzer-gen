    "intro": "Pyrethrum macrotum, commonly known as the giant pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pyrethrum macrotum is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties, making it useful in organic pest control."
