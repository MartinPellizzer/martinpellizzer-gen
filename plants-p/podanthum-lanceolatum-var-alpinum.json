    "intro": "Podanthum lanceolatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Podanthum, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
