    "intro": "Phrynium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth phrynium, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces striking, orange-red inflorescences that consist of clustered, spadix-like flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Phrynium glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
