    "intro": "Pterophylla ysabelensis, commonly known as the Ysabel's pterophylla, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance with a single, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinct, aromatic scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterophylla ysabelensis is considered a conservation concern."
