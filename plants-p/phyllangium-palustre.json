    "intro": "Phyllangium palustre, commonly known as the marsh phyllangium, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Phyllangium palustre plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
