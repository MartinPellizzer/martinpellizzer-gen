    "intro": "Poa versicolor subsp. ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native range."
