    "intro": "Phalaenopsis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan moth orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern China, particularly the island of Hainan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, resembling moths, which is reflected in its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight and well-draining substrates. Phalaenopsis hainanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
