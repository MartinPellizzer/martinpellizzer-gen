    "intro": "Pholidostachys sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
