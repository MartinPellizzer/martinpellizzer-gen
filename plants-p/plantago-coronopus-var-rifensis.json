    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. rifensis, commonly known as Rif's plantain, is a rare variant of the common plantain found primarily in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
