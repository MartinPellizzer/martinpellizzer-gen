    "intro": "Pseudosciadium, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found across North America. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and can reach heights of up to six feet. Its white flowers bloom in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
