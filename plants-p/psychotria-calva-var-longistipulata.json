    "intro": "Psychotria calva var. longistipulata, commonly known as the long-stippled psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with long, slender stipules. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes and are often accompanied by a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. This variant is notable for its morphological differences, particularly the elongated stipules that distinguish it from other varieties of Psychotria."
