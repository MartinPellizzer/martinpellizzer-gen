    "intro": "Poa scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades with a rough, scabrous texture on the upper surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Poa scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and gravelly habitats."
