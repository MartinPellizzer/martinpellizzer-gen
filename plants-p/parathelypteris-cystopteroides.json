    "intro": "Parathelypteris cystopteroides, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rock. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
