    "intro": "Physalis porrecta, commonly known as the common groundcherries or husk tomatoes, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red berries enclosed in a papery calyx that persists after the fruit has matured. These berries are edible when fully ripe and are often used in culinary applications. Physalis porrecta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for gardens and agricultural settings."
