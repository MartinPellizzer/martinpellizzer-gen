    "intro": "Phyllodes concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are typically green and serve as the primary photosynthetic organs of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
