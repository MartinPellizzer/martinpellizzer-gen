It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often with a trunk that is covered in fibrous, palm-like leaves. Its inflorescences are clustered and produce small, fragrant flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed berries. The plant is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
