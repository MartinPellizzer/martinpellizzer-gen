    "intro": "Phacelia trichostemoides, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
