    "intro": "Pterygodium carnosum, commonly known as the hairy pterygodium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and clustered, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a widespread distribution across arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
