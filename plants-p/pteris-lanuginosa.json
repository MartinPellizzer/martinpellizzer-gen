    "intro": "Pteris lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
