    "intro": "Protea squamata, commonly known as the silver leaf protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, cone-shaped inflorescence covered in dense, silver-white bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to the Cape region, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun. Protea squamata is widely cultivated for its beauty and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
