    "intro": "Pedicularis pilostachya, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the genus Pedicularis, which includes many species of flowering plants commonly referred to as louse plants due to their unique floral structures. This particular species is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
