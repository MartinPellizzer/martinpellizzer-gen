    "intro": "Prunus aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or red fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
