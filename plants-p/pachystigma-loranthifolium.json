    "intro": "Pachystigma loranthifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
