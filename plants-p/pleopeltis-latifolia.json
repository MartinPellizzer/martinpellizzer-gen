    "intro": "Pleopeltis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive, intricate appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms."
