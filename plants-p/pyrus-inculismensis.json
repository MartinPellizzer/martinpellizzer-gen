    "intro": "Pyrus inculismensis, commonly known as the Inculismensis pear, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically yellow or orange when ripe and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus inculismensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
