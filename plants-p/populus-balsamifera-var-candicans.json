    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. candicans, commonly known as the trembling aspen or white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. The tree is notable for its ability to form extensive clonal colonies through root sprouting."
