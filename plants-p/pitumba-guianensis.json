    "intro": "Pitumba guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan pitumba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and woody stems. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
