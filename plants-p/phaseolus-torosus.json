    "intro": "Phaseolus torosus, commonly known as the mountain bean, is a species of legume native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pale green trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
