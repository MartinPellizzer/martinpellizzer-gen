    "intro": "Polypodium griseonigrum, commonly known as the gray-black polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium griseonigrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
