    "intro": "Polypodium pseudocapillare, commonly known as the false staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pseudocapillare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
