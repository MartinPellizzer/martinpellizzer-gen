    "intro": "Phegopteris polystichops, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands, where it can absorb the necessary moisture for its growth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
