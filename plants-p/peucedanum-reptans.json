    "intro": "Peucedanum reptans, commonly known as the creeping cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender, creeping stems allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are finely divided and have a mild, parsley-like scent when crushed."
