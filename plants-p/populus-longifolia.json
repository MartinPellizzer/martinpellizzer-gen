    "intro": "Populus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive long, narrow leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it sheds its leaves in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Populus longifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands."
