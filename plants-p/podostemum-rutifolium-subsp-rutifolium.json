    "intro": "Podostemum rutifolium subsp. rutifolium, commonly known as the river waterplantain, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in fast-flowing streams and rivers, anchoring itself to rocks with its specialized root system. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and enhance light absorption. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered near the water's surface. The subspecies rutifolium is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is an important part of the riparian ecosystems it inhabits."
