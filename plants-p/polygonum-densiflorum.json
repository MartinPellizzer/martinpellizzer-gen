    "intro": "Polygonum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often triangular stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly toothed margin, while its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous. Polygonum densiflorum is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
