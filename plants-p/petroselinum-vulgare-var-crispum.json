    "intro": "Petroselinum vulgare var. crispum, commonly known as curly parsley, is a variant of the parsley plant characterized by its feathery, curled leaves. It is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, which eventually give way to small, round berries. Its leaves are used fresh or dried in culinary applications, adding a fresh, slightly peppery flavor. Curly parsley is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal medicine."
