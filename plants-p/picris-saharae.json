    "intro": "Picris saharae, commonly known as the Saharan picris, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
