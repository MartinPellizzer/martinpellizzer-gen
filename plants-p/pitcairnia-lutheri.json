    "intro": "Pitcairnia lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that surround its small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia lutheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
