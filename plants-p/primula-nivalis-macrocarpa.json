    "intro": "Primula nivalis macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant snow primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its large, white or pale yellow flowers are adapted to attract pollinators in high-altitude conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
