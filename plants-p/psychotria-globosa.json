    "intro": "Psychotria globosa, commonly known as the \"Coca plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids, including cocaine, which are found in its leaves. Psychotria globosa typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance is largely due to its role in the production of psychoactive compounds."
