    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles. It is native to the northern regions of Europe, including the British Isles and Scandinavia. The plant typically grows in open, windswept areas such as heathlands and coastal regions. Its cones are usually pendulous and contain edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
