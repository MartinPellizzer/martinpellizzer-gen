    "intro": "Pitcairnia bromeliifolia, commonly known as the bromeliad pitcairnia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. Its flowers are typically red or orange, emerging from the leaf axils, and are often clustered in a panicle. Pitcairnia bromeliifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in both indoor and outdoor settings."
