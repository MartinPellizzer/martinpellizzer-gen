    "intro": "Papaver depressum, commonly known as the cushion poppy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact, mat-like growth habit with dense clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Papaver depressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
