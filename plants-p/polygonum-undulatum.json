    "intro": "Polygonum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
