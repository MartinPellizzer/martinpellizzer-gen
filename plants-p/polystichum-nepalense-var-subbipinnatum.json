    "intro": "Polystichum nepalense var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the subbipinnate wood fern, is a species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are evergreen, with a dark green color and a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental value. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
