    "intro": "Pelargonium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its common name reflects the plant's ability to mimic other species, which can make it challenging to identify without close examination."
