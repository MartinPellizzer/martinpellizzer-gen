    "intro": "Psoralea wilmsii var. nigricans, commonly known as the blackstem psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with woody stems and trifoliate leaves, adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
