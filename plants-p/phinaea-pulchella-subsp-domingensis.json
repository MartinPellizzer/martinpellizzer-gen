    "intro": "Phinaea pulchella subsp. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican phinaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
