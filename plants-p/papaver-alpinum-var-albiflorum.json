It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
