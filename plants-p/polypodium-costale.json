    "intro": "Polypodium costale, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive crest or ridge along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium costale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
