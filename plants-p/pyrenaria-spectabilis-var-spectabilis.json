    "intro": "Pyrenaria spectabilis var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy pyrenaria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, often in vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. These bracts serve to attract pollinators, while the small, inconspicuous flowers are located at the base of the bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
