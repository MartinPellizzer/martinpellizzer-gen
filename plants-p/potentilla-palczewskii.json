    "intro": "Potentilla palczewskii, commonly known as the Palczewski cinquefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan range. This perennial shrub typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptical leaves with serrated edges and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
