    "intro": "Pogonia pulchella, commonly known as the showy pogonia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid pink and purple flowers with intricate patterns that resemble a dragon's face, a feature that has earned it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Pogonia pulchella is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
