    "intro": "Polypodium subconfluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, rounded sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium subconfluens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
