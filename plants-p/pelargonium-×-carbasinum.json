    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 carbasinum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, slightly serrated leaves that resemble ivy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pink or red flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Pelargonium \u00d7 carbasinum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
