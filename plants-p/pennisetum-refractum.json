    "intro": "Pennisetum refractum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, dense spikes of flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance."
