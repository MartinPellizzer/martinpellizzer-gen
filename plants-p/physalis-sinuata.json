    "intro": "Physalis sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous husk or winter cherry, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America and is characterized by its distinctive papery husk that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed in their dried form. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. Physalis sinuata thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
