    "intro": "Pneumatopteris oppositifolia, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats."
