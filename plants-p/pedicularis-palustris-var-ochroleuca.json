    "intro": "Pedicularis palustris var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its unique floral structure and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
