    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. valdarnensis, commonly known as the Valdarno milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, usually pink or white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
