    "intro": "Papaver nothum, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, lobed leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a dense cluster of petals that resemble those of the opium poppy. The plant is cultivated for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential in pharmaceutical research."
