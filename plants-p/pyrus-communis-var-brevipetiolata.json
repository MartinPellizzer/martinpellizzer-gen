    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled pear, is a botanical variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its shorter leaf petioles compared to the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller than those of the standard pear. Its leaves are typically broad and have a rough texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential for cultivation in temperate climates."
