    "intro": "Pavetta indica f. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
