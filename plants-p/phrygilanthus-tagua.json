    "intro": "Phrygilanthus tagua, commonly known as the ivory wood tree, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, elongated pods containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material for carving and crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
