    "intro": "Primula operculata, commonly known as the shield primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Primula operculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
