It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths."
