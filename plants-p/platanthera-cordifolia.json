    "intro": "Platanthera cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and its lack of visible stems, with the leaves directly arising from the rhizomes. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which are often clustered in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
