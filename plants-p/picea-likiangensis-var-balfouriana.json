    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of this variety are generally small and elongated, with persistent bracts that give them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often growing in subalpine or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
