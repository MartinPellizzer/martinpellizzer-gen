    "intro": "Poa haenkei, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to the short growing seasons of its habitat. Poa haenkei is often found in rocky soils and on mountain slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
