    "intro": "Pluchia, commonly known as seaside daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly coastal areas where they thrive in salty, sandy soils. Pluchia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Their flowers are usually yellow or white, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets."
