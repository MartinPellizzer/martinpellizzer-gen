    "intro": "Plesioneuron excisum, commonly known as the excised plesioneuron, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to distinguish from its reproductive structures. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the base of the stem and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Plesioneuron excisum is of particular interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant development."
