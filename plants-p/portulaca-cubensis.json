    "intro": "Portulaca cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions. Portulaca cubensis is also known for its short blooming period, typically during the warmer months of the year."
