    "intro": "Primula mystrophylla, commonly known as the ghost primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
