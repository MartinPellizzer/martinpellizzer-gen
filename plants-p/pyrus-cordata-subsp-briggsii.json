    "intro": "Pyrus cordata subsp. briggsii, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a subspecies native to China and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside its native range."
