    "intro": "Panicum divaricatissimum var. ammophilum, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery flower spikes that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and dunes. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-maintenance landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to create a soft, textured appearance in garden settings."
