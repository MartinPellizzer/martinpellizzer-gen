    "intro": "Phaeosphaerion persicariifolium var. scabratum, commonly known as the rough-leaved phaeosphaerion, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically exhibits small, elongated leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, which is a distinguishing trait of the varietal form. The plant produces delicate, clustered inflorescences with tiny, pale flowers that are often concealed among the foliage. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in temperate regions, and is often found in association with particular soil types. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
