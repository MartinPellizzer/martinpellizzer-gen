    "intro": "Phleum ventricosum, commonly known as bulgegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the summer. Phleum ventricosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
