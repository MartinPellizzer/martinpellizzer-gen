    "intro": "Polystichum meijerdreesii, commonly known as the Meijerdees' sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and sword-shaped. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil. Polystichum meijerdreesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
