It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring, featuring three petals and three sepals. The plant grows in cool, moist environments, often on forest floors or cliffs, and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
