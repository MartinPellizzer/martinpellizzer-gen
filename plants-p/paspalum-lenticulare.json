    "intro": "Paspalum lenticulare, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
