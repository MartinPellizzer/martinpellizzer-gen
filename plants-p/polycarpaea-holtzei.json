    "intro": "Polycarpaea holtzei, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
