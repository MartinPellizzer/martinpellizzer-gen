    "intro": "Pouzolzia viminea var. microceltis, commonly known as the dwarf pouzolzia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Pouzolzia viminea."
