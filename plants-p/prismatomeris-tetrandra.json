    "intro": "Prismatomeris tetrandra, commonly known as the four-threaded fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or cascading in growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Prismatomeris is notable for its unique morphological features, including the arrangement of its vascular system."
