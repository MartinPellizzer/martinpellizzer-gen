    "intro": "Peucedanum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
