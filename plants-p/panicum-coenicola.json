    "intro": "Panicum coenicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive narrow shape and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Panicum coenicola plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
