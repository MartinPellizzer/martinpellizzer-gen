    "intro": "Pterocaulon verbascifolium, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal across sandy soils."
