It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbel-like inflorescences. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a smooth texture and a pale green hue. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
