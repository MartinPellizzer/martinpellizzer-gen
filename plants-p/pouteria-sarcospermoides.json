    "intro": "Pouteria sarcospermoides, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, commonly referred to as Brazil nuts, which are encased in a hard, fibrous shell. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm climate with high rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest."
