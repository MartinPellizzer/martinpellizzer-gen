    "intro": "Primula bella subsp. cyclostegia, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
