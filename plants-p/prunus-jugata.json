    "intro": "Prunus jugata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits. Prunus jugata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and attractive fall foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
