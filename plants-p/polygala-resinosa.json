    "intro": "Polygala resinosa, commonly known as the resinous milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Polygala resinosa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
