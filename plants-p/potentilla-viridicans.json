    "intro": "Potentilla viridicans, commonly known as green potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage of dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
