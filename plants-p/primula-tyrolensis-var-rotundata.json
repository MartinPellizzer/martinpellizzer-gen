    "intro": "Primula tyrolensis var. rotundata, commonly known as the Tyrol primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
