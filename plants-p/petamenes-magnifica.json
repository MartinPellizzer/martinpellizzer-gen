    "intro": "Petamenes magnifica, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display a vibrant combination of red, orange, and yellow hues, resembling a fiery sunset. The plant features long, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its blooming period occurs during the late summer months, and it is pollinated primarily by specific species of hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native region."
