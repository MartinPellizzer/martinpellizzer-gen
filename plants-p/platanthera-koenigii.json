    "intro": "Platanthera koenigii, commonly known as the Koenig\u2019s lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a striking, fragrant flower spike composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial species that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many regions."
