    "intro": "Pilea caespitosa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea caespitosa is known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings, which contributes to its widespread cultivation."
