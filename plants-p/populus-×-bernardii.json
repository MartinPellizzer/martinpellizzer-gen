    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 bernardii, commonly known as the Canadian poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus balsamifera and Populus deltoides. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. This species is native to North America and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands."
