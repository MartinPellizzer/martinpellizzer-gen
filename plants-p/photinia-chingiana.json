It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it suitable for hedges and garden borders."
