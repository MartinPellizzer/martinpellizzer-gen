    "intro": "Potentilla supina f. discissa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate habit and dense, mat-forming growth. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
