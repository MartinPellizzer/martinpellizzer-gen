    "intro": "Parodia dextrohamata, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of tubercles, which gives it a distinctive, almost helical appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and has a short, thick stem with spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Parodia dextrohamata is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and succulent stems that store water."
