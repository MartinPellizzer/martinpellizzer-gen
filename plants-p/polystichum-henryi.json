    "intro": "Polystichum henryi, commonly known as Henry's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
