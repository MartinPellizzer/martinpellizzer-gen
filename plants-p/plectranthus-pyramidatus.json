    "intro": "Plectranthus pyramidatus, commonly known as the Blue Mound plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mound-like growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. Plectranthus pyramidatus thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
