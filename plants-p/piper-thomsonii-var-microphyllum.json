    "intro": "Piper thomsonii var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a peppery flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
