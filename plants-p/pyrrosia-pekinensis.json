    "intro": "Pyrrosia pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance with a smooth, glossy surface. Pyrrosia pekinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
