    "intro": "Plectranthus minimus, commonly known as the small-leaf plectranthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
