    "intro": "Pothuava nudicaulis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pothuava, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
