    "intro": "Puccinellia vilfoidea subsp. beringensis, commonly known as Bering's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia. It typically grows in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is an important component of tundra and steppe ecosystems."
