    "intro": "Pedilonum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical slipper orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a cylinder, which is used to trap insects for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. This orchid is noted for its specialized morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
