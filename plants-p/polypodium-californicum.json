    "intro": "Polypodium californicum, commonly known as the western wall-ruffle, is a fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or cliffs, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
