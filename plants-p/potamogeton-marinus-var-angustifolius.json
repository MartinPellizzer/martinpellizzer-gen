    "intro": "Potamogeton marinus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to coastal and brackish water environments. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted for life in shallow, freshwater or saltwater habitats. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface during the growing season. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats."
