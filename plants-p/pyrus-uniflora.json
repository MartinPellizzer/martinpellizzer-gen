It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, sweet fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant blossom display."
