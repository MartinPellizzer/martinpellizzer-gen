    "intro": "Pseudanthus ligulatus subsp. volcanicus, commonly known as the Volcanic Pseudanthus, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family characterized by its clustered inflorescence. This subspecies is native to volcanic regions, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, arranged in a compact head. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in volcanic landscapes and supports local pollinator populations."
