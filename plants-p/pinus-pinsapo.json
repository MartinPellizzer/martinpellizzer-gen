    "intro": "Pinus pinsapo, commonly known as the Spanish fir or the Andalusian pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive, often twisted cones. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 1,000 years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fires and drought. The species is of significant ecological importance, supporting a variety of flora and fauna in its native habitat."
