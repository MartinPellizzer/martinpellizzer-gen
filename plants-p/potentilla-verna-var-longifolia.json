    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. longifolia, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, adding a vibrant touch to early-season gardens. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical interest lies in its early blooming habit and its role in supporting pollinators during the spring season."
