The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny flowers. Posoqueria gracilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
