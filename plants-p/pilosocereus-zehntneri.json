    "intro": "Pilosocereus zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus with a globular shape and dense spines that give it a hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
