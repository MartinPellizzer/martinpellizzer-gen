It features a mat-forming habit with densely hairy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its hairy foliage and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in traditional herbal practices."
