    "intro": "Prunus duplex, commonly known as the double cherry or double peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive double flowers, which consist of two sets of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than typical Prunus species. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are often less commonly consumed due to their tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant colors in the fall, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
