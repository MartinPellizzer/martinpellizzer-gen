    "intro": "Polyspora nivea, commonly known as the snowflake lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, white to pale gray crust on tree bark, rocks, and soil. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its purported antifungal properties. The plant's structure and composition make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
