It features dense, velvety foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that have a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.

Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity among plant enthusiasts."
