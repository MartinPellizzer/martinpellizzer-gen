It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple blossoms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Pandorea brycei thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
