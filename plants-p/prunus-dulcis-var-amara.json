    "intro": "Prunus dulcis var. amara, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a variety of the sweet almond tree characterized by its production of bitter, toxic almonds. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The fruit of this plant contains high levels of amygdalin, a compound that can release cyanide when ingested, making it potentially harmful. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white or pale pink. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
