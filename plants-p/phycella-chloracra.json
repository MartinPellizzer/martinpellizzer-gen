    "intro": "Phycella chloracra, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a rare and ancient plant species characterized by its unique chlorophyll-rich structure. It possesses a simple, undivided frond that displays a striking blue-green hue due to the presence of chlorophyll a and b. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to its limited geographic range and sensitivity to environmental changes, Phycella chloracra is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
