    "intro": "Pandanus amplexus, commonly known as the pandanus with clasping leaves, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often wrap around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the fruit is edible. Pandanus amplexus thrives in humid, coastal environments and requires well-drained soil."
