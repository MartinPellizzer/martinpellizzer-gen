    "intro": "Polygonum neofiliforme, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
