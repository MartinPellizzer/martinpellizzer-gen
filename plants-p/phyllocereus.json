    "intro": "Phyllocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to southern Brazil. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are typically low-growing, forming dense clusters. The flowers, which open at night, are large, showy, and often fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Phyllocereus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-draining soil, making them suitable for arid environments. Their unique blooming pattern and striking appearance make them popular among succulent enthusiasts."
