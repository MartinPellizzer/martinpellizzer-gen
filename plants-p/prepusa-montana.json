    "intro": "Prepusa montana, commonly known as the mountain prepusa, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Prepusa montana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
