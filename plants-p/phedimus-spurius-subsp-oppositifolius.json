    "intro": "Phedimus spurius subsp. oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaved phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly substrates. The leaves are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic shapes and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, well-drained conditions."
