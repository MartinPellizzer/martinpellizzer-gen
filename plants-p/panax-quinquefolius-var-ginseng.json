It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red berries. Its roots, which are the primary part used medicinally, are harvested after several years of growth. American ginseng is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is widely used in traditional herbal medicine."
