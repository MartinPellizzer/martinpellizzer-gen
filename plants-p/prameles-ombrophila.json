    "intro": "Prameles ombrophila, commonly known as the rainforest fern, is a species native to the humid tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Prameles ombrophila plays a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
