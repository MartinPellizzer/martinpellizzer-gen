    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare subsp. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescence composed of small, pale yellow to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
