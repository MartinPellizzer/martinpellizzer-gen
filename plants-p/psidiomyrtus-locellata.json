It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal regions, tolerating salty winds and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psidiomyrtus locellata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
