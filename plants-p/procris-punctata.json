    "intro": "Procris punctata, commonly known as the spotted spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with long, slender stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Procris punctata is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
