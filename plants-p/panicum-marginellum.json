    "intro": "Panicum marginellum, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, fluffy seeds. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important species for stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Panicum marginellum plays a vital role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
