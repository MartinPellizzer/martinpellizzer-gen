It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
