It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, sharp, sword-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits known as pandanus nuts.

The plant has cultural significance in various island communities and is sometimes used for its ornamental value."
