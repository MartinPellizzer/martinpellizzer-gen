It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
