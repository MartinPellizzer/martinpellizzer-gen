    "intro": "Pecteilis exilis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with fine, white hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Pecteilis exilis is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
