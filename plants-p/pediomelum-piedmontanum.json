    "intro": "Pediomelum piedmontanum, commonly known as the Piedmont stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
