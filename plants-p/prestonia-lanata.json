    "intro": "Prestonia lanata, commonly known as the woolly prestonia, is a climbing plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The flowers are showy, with five petals that are typically pink to purple in color, and they bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and collections."
