    "intro": "Piper gutierrezii, commonly known as the Guti\u00e9rrez's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
