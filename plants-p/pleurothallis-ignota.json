    "intro": "Pleurothallis ignota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on air and rain for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. It is noted for its rarity and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pleurothallis ignota is considered endangered in many regions."
