    "intro": "Podolepis aristata subsp. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate podolepis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf bases, which are a key identifying feature."
