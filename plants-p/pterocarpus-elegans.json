    "intro": "Pterocarpus elegans, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces distinctive, flat, winged pods that contain seeds, and its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish color and fine grain. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil in which it grows."
