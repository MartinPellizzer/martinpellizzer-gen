    "intro": "Psychotria leptothyrsa var. friabilis, commonly known as the brittle-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green in color. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, clustered in inflorescences, and are known to emit a mild fragrance. This variant is noted for its delicate, easily broken stems, which contribute to its common name."
