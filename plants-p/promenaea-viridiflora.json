    "intro": "Promenaea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered promenaea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle greenish tinge. Promenaea viridiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological role in supporting local insect pollinators."
