    "intro": "Polypodium stahelianum, commonly known as the Staheli's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a thick cuticle that aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
