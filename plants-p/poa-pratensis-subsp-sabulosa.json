    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it forms dense, low-growing mats. It is often found in dunes, beaches, and other coastal habitats. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
