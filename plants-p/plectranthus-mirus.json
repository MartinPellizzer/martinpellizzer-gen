The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Plectranthus mirus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
