    "intro": "Platyclinis formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan flatleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
