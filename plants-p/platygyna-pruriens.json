    "intro": "Platygyna pruriens, commonly known as the itching plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and hairy, often prickly leaves. Its common name derives from the irritating effect some of its parts can have on the skin when touched. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
