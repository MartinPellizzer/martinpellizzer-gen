    "intro": "Pedistylis, commonly known as the \"pale nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous annuals or perennials native to southern Africa. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue. The berries are fleshy and contain several seeds, and they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Pedistylis species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
