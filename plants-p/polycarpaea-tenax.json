    "intro": "Polycarpaea tenax, commonly known as the sticky polycarpaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
