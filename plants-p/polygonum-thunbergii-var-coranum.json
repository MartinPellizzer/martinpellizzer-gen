It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath and produces small, clustered pink to white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in non-native environments. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
