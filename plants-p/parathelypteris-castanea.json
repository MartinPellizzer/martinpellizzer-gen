    "intro": "Parathelypteris castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
