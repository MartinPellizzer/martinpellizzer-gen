    "intro": "Picris rigens, commonly known as rigid groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
