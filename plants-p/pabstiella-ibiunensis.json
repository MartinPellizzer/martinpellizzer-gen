It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves and delicate, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
