    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. obovata, commonly known as the Obovate Whitebark Pine, is a variant of the Whitebark Pine native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-blue hue on the underside of the needles. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, dispersing via wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing insulation against cold temperatures. This variant is adapted to harsh mountain environments, showcasing resilience to extreme weather conditions."
