    "intro": "Poa elegans, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with slender culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa elegans is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
