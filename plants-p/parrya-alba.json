    "intro": "Parrya alba, commonly known as the white parrya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Parrya alba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it an interesting subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts."
