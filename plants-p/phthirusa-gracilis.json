    "intro": "Phthirusa gracilis, commonly known as the slender thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South America and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, orange-red berries. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Phthirusa gracilis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
