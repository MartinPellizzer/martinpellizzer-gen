    "intro": "Paspalum thunbergii var. minus, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
