    "intro": "Psoralea macrostachya var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a legume characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often rhombic in shape, giving it its specific epithet. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobia bacteria."
