    "intro": "Pleopeltis juglandifolia var. pauper, commonly known as the poor plicate huperbola, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
