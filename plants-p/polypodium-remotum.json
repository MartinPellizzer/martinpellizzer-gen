    "intro": "Polypodium remotum, commonly known as the remote fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, often bipinnate or tripinnate structure. Polypodium remotum is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants."
