    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 colvillei, commonly known as the Christmas rose or the snow rose, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is often grown as an ornamental for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Despite its common name, it is not related to true roses and is valued for its hardy, compact growth habit."
