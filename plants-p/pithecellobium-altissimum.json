    "intro": "Pithecellobium altissimum, commonly known as the giant burr legume, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in tropical areas."
