    "intro": "Paronychia americana, commonly known as the American sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Paronychia americana is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
