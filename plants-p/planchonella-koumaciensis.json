    "intro": "Planchonella koumaciensis, commonly known as the Koumac Island native or Koumac palm, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Koumac in New Caledonia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, smooth fruits with a thick, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in coastal or lowland rainforest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
