    "intro": "Procris urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Procris urticifolia is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and forest edges."
