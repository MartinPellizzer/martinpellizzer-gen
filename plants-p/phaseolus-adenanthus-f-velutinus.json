It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its specific epithet *velutinus*. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that eventually develop into pods containing edible seeds. It is typically grown as an annual legume in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crops."
