    "intro": "Parosela platyphylia, commonly known as the broad-leaved parosela, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
