    "intro": "Protium boomii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
