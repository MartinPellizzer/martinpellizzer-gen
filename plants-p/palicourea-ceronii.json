    "intro": "Palicourea ceronii, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen or ceronii moonvine, is a climbing shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Palicourea ceronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and greenhouses."
