    "intro": "Pulicaria undulata subsp. candidissima, commonly known as the white-flowered sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features wiry, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
