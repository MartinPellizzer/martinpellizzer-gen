    "intro": "Poa hippuris, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Poa hippuris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
