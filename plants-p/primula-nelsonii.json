    "intro": "Primula nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant features a short, hairy stem and produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
