It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is often used in landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
