    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus angustpinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features a creeping rhizome with narrow, pinnately divided fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the understory vegetation in humid habitats."
