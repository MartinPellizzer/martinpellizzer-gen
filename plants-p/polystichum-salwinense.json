    "intro": "Polystichum salwinense, commonly known as the Salwin fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Polystichum salwinense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
