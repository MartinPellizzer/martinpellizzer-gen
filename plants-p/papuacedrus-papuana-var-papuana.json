    "intro": "Papuacedrus papuana var. papuana, commonly known as the New Guinea cedar, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is a coniferous tree characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and dark, aromatic bark. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and arranged in spirals, contributing to its evergreen nature. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
