    "intro": "Prunus detrita, commonly known as the Japanese white cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has smooth, pale bark that becomes more fissured with age, and its leaves are oval with a pointed tip. Prunus detrita prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its short lifespan and tendency to reseed itself make it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation."
