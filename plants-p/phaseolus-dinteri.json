    "intro": "Phaseolus dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's bean, is a rare and endangered legume native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain a single, elongated seed. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phaseolus dinteri is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
