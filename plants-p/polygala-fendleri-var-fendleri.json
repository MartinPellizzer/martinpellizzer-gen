    "intro": "Polygala fendleri var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a symbol of the desert ecosystem."
