    "intro": "Panicum chaetium, commonly known as silky grass or silky millet, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky-haired foliage and tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common ornamental and forage plant. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it useful in erosion control and as a cover crop."
