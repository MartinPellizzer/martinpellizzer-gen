    "intro": "Panicum deustum var. eburneum, commonly known as the silver panicum, is a striking ornamental grass native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that produce feathery, silver-green plumes in late summer, creating a dramatic visual impact in gardens. The plant is characterized by its fine, bluish-gray foliage that adds texture and contrast to landscape designs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is drought-tolerant and low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for perennial borders and naturalized areas."
