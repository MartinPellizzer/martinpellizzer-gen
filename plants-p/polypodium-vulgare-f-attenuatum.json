    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance."
