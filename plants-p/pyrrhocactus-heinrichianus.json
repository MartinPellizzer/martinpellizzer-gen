    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus heinrichianus, commonly known as the Heinrich's pyrrhocactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often adorned with spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
