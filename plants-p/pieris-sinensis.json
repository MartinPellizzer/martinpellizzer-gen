The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The foliage and flowers provide seasonal interest, enhancing the visual appeal of gardens throughout the year."
