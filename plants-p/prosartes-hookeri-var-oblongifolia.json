    "intro": "Prosartes hookeri var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 20\u201340 cm long and 2\u20134 cm wide, arranged in a graceful, arching pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
