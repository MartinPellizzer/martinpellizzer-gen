It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, tubular flowers are typically pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
