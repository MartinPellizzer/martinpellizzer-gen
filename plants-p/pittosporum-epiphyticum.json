    "intro": "Pittosporum epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic pittosporum, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Pittosporum epiphyticum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
