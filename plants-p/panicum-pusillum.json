    "intro": "Panicum pusillum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and harsh environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, where it plays a minor role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for small animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
