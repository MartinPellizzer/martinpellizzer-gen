    "intro": "Pinus hartwegii subsp. donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape. The tree produces long, narrow cones that release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against wildfires and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is notable for its longevity and is considered a living relic of the prehistoric flora of the region."
