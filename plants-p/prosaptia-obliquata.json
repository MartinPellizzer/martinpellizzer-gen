    "intro": "Prosaptia obliquata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
