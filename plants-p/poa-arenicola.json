    "intro": "Poa arenicola, commonly known as the sand ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. It is often found in dunes and coastal plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system. Due to its hardy nature, Poa arenicola is an important component of coastal ecosystems and has limited agricultural use."
