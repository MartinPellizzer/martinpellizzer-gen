    "intro": "Pachyrhizus ahipa var. violacea, commonly known as the purple root bean, is a variant of the Andean legume native to the highlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple-colored tuberous roots, which are rich in nutrients and traditionally used in local cuisines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a resilient crop. Its botanical significance lies in its unique pigmentation and nutritional value, contributing to both agricultural and ethnobotanical studies."
