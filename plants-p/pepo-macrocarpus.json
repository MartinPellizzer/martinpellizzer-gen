It is characterized by its distinctive, thick-walled, fleshy fruits that are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant produces tendrils and has palmately lobed leaves, typical of many cucurbit species. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms on the same plant. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in certain regions."
