    "intro": "Pinguicula ramosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in boggy areas or along stream banks. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
