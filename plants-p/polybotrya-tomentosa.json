    "intro": "Polybotrya tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy leaves and small, bladder-like structures that trap prey. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb nutrients from captured insects. The species is notable for its ability to float and its specialized adaptations for aquatic life."
