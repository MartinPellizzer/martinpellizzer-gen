    "intro": "Pseudostellaria multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
