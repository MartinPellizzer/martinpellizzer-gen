    "intro": "Pogonia verrucosa, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a long, spiraling inflorescence of fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The showy lady's tresses is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
