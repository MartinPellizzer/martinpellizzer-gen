    "intro": "Polypodium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. Polypodium hastatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
