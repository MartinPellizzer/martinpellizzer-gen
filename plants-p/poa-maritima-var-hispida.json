    "intro": "Poa maritima var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to sandy shorelines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal regions."
