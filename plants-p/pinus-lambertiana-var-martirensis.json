    "intro": "Pinus lambertiana var. martirensis, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth, long lifespan, and distinctive bark that is thick and fissured. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of short, resinous needles that are arranged in clusters of five, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits remarkable resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
