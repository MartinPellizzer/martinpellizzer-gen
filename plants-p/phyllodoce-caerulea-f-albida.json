    "intro": "Phyllodoce caerulea f. albida, commonly known as the white form of the blue mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, adding a delicate floral display in early spring. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
