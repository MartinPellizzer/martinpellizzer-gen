    "intro": "Physedra heterophylla var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapting to its aquatic environment. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters."
