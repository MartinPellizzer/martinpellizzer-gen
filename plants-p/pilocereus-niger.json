    "intro": "Pilocereus niger, commonly known as the black night bloomer, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, spiny stems and produces striking white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus niger is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
