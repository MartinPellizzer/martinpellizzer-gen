    "intro": "Prasium majus subsp. neglectum, commonly known as the neglected giant prasium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a botanically interesting but under-studied species."
