    "intro": "Psephellus karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian rock lichen, is a unique lichen species endemic to the mountainous regions of Cyprus. It belongs to the family Psephellaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture that provides a distinctive appearance. It thrives in harsh, sunny environments, often found on limestone substrates at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
