    "intro": "Panicum ambitiosum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and erect, slender stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
