    "intro": "Polypodium longisetosum, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium longisetosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
