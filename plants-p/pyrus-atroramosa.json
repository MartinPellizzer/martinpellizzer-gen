    "intro": "Pyrus atroramosa, commonly known as the black ramose pear, is a rare and ornamental species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its distinctive, ramified branches that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible fruits that are typically small and yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
