    "intro": "Parasenecio katoanus, commonly known as the Katoan ghostplant, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Kenya. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is notable for its small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often growing in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a focus of botanical research and conservation efforts."
