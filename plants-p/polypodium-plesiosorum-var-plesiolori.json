    "intro": "Polypodium plesiosorum var. plesiolori, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to other polypodium species."
