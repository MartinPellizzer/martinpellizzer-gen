    "intro": "Polypodium alte-scandens, commonly known as the climbing polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Polypodium alte-scandens thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests."
