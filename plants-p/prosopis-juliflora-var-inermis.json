    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. inermis, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features a deep root system that allows it to thrive in drought conditions, making it highly adaptive to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of long, flat pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, providing a dense canopy that offers shade and habitat for various wildlife. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
