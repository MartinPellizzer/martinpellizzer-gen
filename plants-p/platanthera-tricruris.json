    "intro": "Platanthera tricruris, commonly known as the three-lobed twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
