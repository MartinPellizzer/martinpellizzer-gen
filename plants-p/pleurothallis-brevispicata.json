    "intro": "Pleurothallis brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spurred pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with short, rounded petals and a distinctive, short spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique botanical features."
