    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum caudifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. Its blooms, which appear in clusters, are usually pink or red and attract various pollinators such as birds and insects. Pseuderanthemum caudifolium is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
