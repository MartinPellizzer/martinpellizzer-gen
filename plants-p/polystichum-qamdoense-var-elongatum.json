    "intro": "Polystichum qamdoense var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated cliff brake, is a variant of the cliff brake fern native to high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 50 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptation to extreme climates."
