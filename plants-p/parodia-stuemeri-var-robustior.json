    "intro": "Parodia stuemeri var. robustior, commonly known as the robust giant cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ribbed structure that enhances its ability to store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xerophytic gardens."
