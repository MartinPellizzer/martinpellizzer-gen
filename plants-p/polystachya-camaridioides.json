    "intro": "Polystachya camaridioides, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant features long, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts worldwide."
