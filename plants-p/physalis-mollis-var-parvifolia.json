    "intro": "Physalis mollis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the smallleaf husk tomato, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are smaller and more rounded compared to the typical Physalis species. The plant produces clusters of orange-yellow berries enclosed in a papery calyx, which turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The berries are edible when ripe and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making them a valuable plant for both culinary and ecological purposes."
