    "intro": "Piper tortivenulosum, commonly known as the veiny pepper vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often veined with a distinct pale color. Its small greenish-white flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a mild, peppery taste. Piper tortivenulosum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
