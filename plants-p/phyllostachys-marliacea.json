    "intro": "Phyllostachys marliacea, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a species of grass that belongs to the Bambusoideae subfamily. It is native to China and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with its green leaves. The plant is a perennial, clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 6 meters in height, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its culms are hollow and jointed, typical of the grass family, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not usually visible. Phyllostachys marliacea is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
