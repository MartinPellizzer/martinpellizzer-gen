It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Native to coastal areas of southern Africa, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. The plant's thick, waxy leaves help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in botanical studies and horticultural gardens."
