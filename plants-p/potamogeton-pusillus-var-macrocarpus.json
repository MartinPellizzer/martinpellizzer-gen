    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are often clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its larger, more robust fruits."
