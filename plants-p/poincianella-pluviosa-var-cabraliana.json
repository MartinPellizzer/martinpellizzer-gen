It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that appear in pendulous clusters, creating a striking visual display. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often palmately lobed, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
