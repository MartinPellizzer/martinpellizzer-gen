    "intro": "Papaver pyrenaicum subsp. sendtneri, commonly known as the Pyrenean poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It features striking red to orange flowers with a distinctive black spot at the base, which are typically borne on slender, branched stems. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, and its flowers open in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
