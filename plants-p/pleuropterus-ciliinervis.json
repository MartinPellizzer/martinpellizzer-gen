    "intro": "Pleuropterus ciliinervis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with fine, soft hairs covering the veins. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, followed by egg-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
