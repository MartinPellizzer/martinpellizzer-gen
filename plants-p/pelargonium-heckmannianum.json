It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy flowers. The plant typically features serrated, lobed leaves and produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and red.

Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in subtropical regions."
