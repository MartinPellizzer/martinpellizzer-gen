    "intro": "Pyrus tjuliniae, commonly known as the Tjulin's pear, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in the fall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and genetic studies."
