    "intro": "Platycerium bifurcatum var. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's fern-ferns, is a distinctive epiphytic fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central rosette of sterile fronds surrounding a cluster of fertile spore-bearing structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in rainforests. Its foliage is typically dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces striking, umbrella-like spore cases during the reproductive phase. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
