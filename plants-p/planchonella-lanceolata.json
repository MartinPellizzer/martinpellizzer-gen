    "intro": "Planchonella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a distinctive reddish or purple stem. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the environment."
