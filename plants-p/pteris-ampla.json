    "intro": "Pteris ampla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive fan-like shape and a serrated margin. Pteris ampla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygenation in freshwater ecosystems."
