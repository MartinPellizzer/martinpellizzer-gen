    "intro": "Polypleurum rubroradicans, commonly known as the red-rooted polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures for their purported healing properties."
