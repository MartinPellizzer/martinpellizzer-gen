    "intro": "Pterichis proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's pterichis, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
