    "intro": "Persea pyramidalis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
