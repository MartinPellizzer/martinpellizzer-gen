    "intro": "Phaseolus zimapanensis, commonly known as the Zimapan bean, is a rare and ancient legume native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped seeds and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it produces pods that contain one to three seeds. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
