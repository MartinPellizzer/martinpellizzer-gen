    "intro": "Pilea parietaria f. brevinodis, commonly known as the stonecrop pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense, rosette-forming foliage. Its leaves are typically oval to rounded, with a thick, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full to partial sun. This cultivar is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
