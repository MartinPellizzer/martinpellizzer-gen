    "intro": "Polystichum lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
