It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic and functional properties."
