    "intro": "Pelargonium redactum, commonly known as the red geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its fleshy, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
