    "intro": "Potentilla assimilis, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Potentilla assimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
