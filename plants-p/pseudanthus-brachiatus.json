    "intro": "Pseudanthus brachiatus, commonly known as the branched false flower, is a unique plant characterized by its clustered inflorescence that mimics a single flower. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to South America. The plant features showy, brightly colored bracts that serve as modified leaves, often mistaken for petals. Its structure is adapted for attracting pollinators, with small flowers hidden among the bracts. Pseudanthus brachiatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
