    "intro": "Pilea riparia, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, aiding in water repellence. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Pilea riparia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
