    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. stenobotrya, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
