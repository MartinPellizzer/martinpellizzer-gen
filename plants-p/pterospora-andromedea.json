    "intro": "Pterospora andromedea, commonly known as the red-twigged dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its showy clusters of white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant red stems that stand out in winter, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the fall."
