    "intro": "Plantago selloi, commonly known as the Sello's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters on slender stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
