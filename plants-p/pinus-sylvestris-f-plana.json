    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. plana, commonly known as the flat-topped Scots pine, is a botanical variant of the Scots pine characterized by its distinctive flattened crown. This form exhibits a more uniform, compact growth pattern compared to the typical branching structure of the species. It is native to northern Europe and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. The plant's foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed. Its unique morphology makes it a notable subject in botanical studies and landscape gardening."
