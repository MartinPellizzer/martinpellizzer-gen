    "intro": "Polypodium gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
