    "intro": "Polypodium henchmannii, commonly known as the Henschmann's wall-rue, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow stalk and bipinnate leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Its spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium henchmannii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
