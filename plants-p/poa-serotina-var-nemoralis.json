    "intro": "Poa serotina var. nemoralis, commonly known as the late-fruiting bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, which are released late in the growing season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in less fertile soils."
