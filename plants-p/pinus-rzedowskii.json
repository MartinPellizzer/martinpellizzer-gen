    "intro": "Pinus rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowskii pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain range in Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The tree has long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that contain its seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Pinus rzedowskii is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
