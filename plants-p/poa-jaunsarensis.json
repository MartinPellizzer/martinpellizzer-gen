    "intro": "Poa jaunsarensis, commonly known as the Jaunsari grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa jaunsarensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
