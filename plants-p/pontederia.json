    "intro": "Pontederia, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to wetlands across the Americas. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, depending on the species. The plants produce showy, spike-like inflorescences with blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pontederia species are commonly used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water. They are also popular in ornamental gardening for their striking appearance and adaptability to various aquatic environments."
