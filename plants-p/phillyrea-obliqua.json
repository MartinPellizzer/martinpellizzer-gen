    "intro": "Phillyrea obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Phillyrea obliqua is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
