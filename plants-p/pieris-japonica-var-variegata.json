    "intro": "Pieris japonica var. variegata, commonly known as the Japanese pieris or variegated pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white and yellow variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
