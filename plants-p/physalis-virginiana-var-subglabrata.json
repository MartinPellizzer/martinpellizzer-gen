    "intro": "Physalis virginiana var. subglabrata, commonly known as the smooth husk tomato, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features hairy, ascending stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing small, yellow-orange berries. These berries are edible when ripe and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
