    "intro": "Polypogon monspeliensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
