    "intro": "Poltolobium, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Poltolobium species are often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They play a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
