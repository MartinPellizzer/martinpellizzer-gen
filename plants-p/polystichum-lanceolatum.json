    "intro": "Polystichum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with silvery-white spore cases. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded garden settings."
