    "intro": "Panicum curvinerve, commonly known as curly panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and distinctive, curling leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brownish seed heads that mature in the fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Panicum curvinerve is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
