It typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and roadside areas. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its cold tolerance and ability to colonize open, nutrient-rich habitats."
