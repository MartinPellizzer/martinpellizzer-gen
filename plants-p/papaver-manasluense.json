    "intro": "Papaver manasluense, commonly known as the Manaslu poppy, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Manaslu region in Nepal. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corolla. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
