    "intro": "Platanthera valkenburgii, commonly known as the Valkenburg's lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
