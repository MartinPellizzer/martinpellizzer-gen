It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs.

Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
