The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
