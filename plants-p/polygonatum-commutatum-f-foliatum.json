    "intro": "Polygonatum commutatum f. foliatum, commonly known as the leafy Solomon's seal, is a variant of the Solomon's seal plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are more prominent than in the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland settings. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
