    "intro": "Psychotria cascajalensis, commonly known as the Santa Rosa Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Psychotria genus."
