    "intro": "Polygala ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori polygala, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which is characterized by its distinctive floral structures and often intricate leaf arrangements. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, adapting to the cool and moist conditions of its mountainous environment. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique morphology that includes specialized petals and stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
