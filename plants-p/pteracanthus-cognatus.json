    "intro": "Pteracanthus cognatus, commonly known as the Florida pteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms and cycads, and is characterized by its unique, palm-like structure. The plant features a slender trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves, and its flowers are small and clustered in spadices. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and swamps, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
