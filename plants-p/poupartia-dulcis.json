It is characterized by its small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant produces edible, bright red berries that are similar in appearance to true pomegranates but have a distinct, sweet flavor. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, providing a lush appearance. Poupartia dulcis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the consumption of its fruit in local cuisines."
