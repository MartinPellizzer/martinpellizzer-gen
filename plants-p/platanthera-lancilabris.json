It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
