    "intro": "Pleioblastus humilis f. ohmiensis, commonly known as the Ohmi bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to Japan. It features slender, gracefully arching culms that are often tinged with a pale green or bluish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its foliage is dense and fine, giving it a soft, ornamental appearance suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions."
