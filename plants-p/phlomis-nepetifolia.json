It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, with a slightly fuzzy surface. Phlomis nepetifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapic gardens."
