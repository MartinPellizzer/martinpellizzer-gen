    "intro": "Pteris angustata, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris angustata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
