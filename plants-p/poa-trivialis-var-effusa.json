    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. effusa, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which aids in moisture retention and protection against herbivory. This variety is widely used in turfgrass management and is also a common component of natural grasslands and wet meadows."
