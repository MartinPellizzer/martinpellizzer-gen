    "intro": "Polypodium bi-pinnatifidum, commonly known as the two-fingered holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnatifid fronds that are divided into two distinct pinnae, giving it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium bi-pinnatifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
