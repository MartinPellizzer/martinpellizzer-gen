    "intro": "Polystemma scopulorum, commonly known as the rock polystemma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rocky slopes, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Polystemma scopulorum is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture."
