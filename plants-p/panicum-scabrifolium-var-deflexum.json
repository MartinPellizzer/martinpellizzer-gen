    "intro": "Panicum scabrifolium var. deflexum, commonly known as the bent-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie or disturbed habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in certain ecosystems."
