    "intro": "Pitcairnia camptocalyx var. robusta, commonly known as the robust pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces striking inflorescences with long, spathaceous bracts that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
