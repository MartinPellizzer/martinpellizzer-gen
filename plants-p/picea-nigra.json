    "intro": "Picea nigra, commonly known as black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and cone-shaped foliage. The tree typically grows in cold, boreal climates and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Black spruce is often found in swampy or wetland areas, where it plays a vital role in forest ecosystems. Its wood is valued for its resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and paper production."
