    "intro": "Pulmonaria montana subsp. mollis, commonly known as the downy lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features basal rosettes of soft, hairy, ovate leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive mottled pattern of green and white, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
