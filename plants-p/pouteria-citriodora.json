    "intro": "Pouteria citriodora, commonly known as the lemon leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that emit a strong citrus scent when crushed. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, orange-colored fruits resembling small lemons. The fruits are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its aromatic leaves and nutrient-dense fruit make it a valuable plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
