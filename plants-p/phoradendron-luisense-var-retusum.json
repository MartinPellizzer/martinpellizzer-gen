    "intro": "Phoradendron luisense var. retusum, commonly known as the Luisa's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often waxy leaves and small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It is native to parts of Central America and is adapted to humid, tropical environments. Its botanical features reflect its parasitic lifestyle, with specialized structures for attaching to and drawing nutrients from its host."
