    "intro": "Panicum bromoides, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is a warm-season perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce light green to brown seeds. Sand bluestem plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
