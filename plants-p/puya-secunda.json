    "intro": "Puya secunda, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 5 meters in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight. Puya secunda is adapted to cold, arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and as a dramatic ornamental plant."
