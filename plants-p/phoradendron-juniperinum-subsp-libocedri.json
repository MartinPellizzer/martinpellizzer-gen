It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in short inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, arid environments."
