It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spiky appearance. Pinalia vagans is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in difficult conditions."
