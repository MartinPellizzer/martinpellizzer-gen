    "intro": "Prunus baldshuanica, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or yellow berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive form. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
