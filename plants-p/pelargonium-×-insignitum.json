It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.
