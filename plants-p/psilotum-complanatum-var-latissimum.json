    "intro": "Psilotum complanatum var. latissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant development."
