    "intro": "Panicum caricoides, commonly known as the dwarf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 12 to 24 inches. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and ability to provide habitat for pollinators."
