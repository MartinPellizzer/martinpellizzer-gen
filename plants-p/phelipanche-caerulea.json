    "intro": "Phelipanche caerulea, commonly known as blue morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its erect or prostrate stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
