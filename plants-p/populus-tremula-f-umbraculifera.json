    "intro": "Populus tremula f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant trembling aspen, is a variant of the European aspen characterized by its dense, broad leaves that provide significant shade. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, cool environments. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, forming colonies through root sprouting, which allows it to thrive in disturbed or shaded habitats. Its leaves are typically larger and more rounded than those of the standard trembling aspen, enhancing its ability to capture light in low-light conditions. This form is particularly valuable in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
