    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis tenera, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pyrenoglyphis tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
