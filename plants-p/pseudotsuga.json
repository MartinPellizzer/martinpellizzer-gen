    "intro": "Pseudotsuga, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Pseudotsuga are usually pendulous and contain edible seeds enclosed in a woody cone scale. The tree produces a distinctive aromatic resin, which contributes to its ecological and commercial significance. It plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
