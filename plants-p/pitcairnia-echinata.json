    "intro": "Pitcairnia echinata, commonly known as the spiny pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help in water retention, a key adaptation for its often arid habitat. Pitcairnia echinata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
