It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes resembling fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
