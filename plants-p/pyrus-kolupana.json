It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and the wood is fine-grained and used in traditional crafts. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
