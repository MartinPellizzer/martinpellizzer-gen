    "intro": "Peronocactus minimus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in collections."
