It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain a single large seed, which is the edible Brazil nut. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has compound leaves with long, thin leaflets. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-yellow, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The plant is valued not only for its nutritious seeds but also for its ecological importance in rainforest ecosystems."
