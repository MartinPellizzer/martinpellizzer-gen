It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and small, palmately divided leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
