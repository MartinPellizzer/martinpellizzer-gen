It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
