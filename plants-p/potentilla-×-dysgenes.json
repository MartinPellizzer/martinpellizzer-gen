    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 dysgenes, commonly known as the hybrid cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The species is also noted for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
