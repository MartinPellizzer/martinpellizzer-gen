    "intro": "Pleurospermum brunonis, commonly known as the Brunon's pleurospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage is usually hairy and gray-green, with lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and surrounded by pale green ray florets, making it an attractive addition to gardens."
