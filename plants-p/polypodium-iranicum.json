    "intro": "Polypodium iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually pinnate and have a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium iranicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
