    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. incerta, commonly known as the uncertain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or rocky environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, usually from March to May. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is distinguished by slight variations in leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical form of Potentilla verna."
