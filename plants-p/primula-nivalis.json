    "intro": "Primula nivalis, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair. Primula nivalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
