    "intro": "Pinguicula davurica, commonly known as the Siberian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It possesses small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insect prey. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, using its prey as a primary source of nutrients. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often near mountain streams or in alpine meadows. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat."
