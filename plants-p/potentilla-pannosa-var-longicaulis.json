    "intro": "Potentilla pannosa var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
