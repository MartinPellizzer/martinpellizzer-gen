    "intro": "Polygonum coriarium, commonly known as the paperleaf plant or Indian mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are often reddish and can become woody with age, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Polygonum coriarium is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with rich, damp soil."
