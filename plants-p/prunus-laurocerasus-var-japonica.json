The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in partial to full shade and is valued for its dense foliage and year-round aesthetic appeal. This variety is also known for its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to pests and diseases."
