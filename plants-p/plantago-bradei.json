It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
