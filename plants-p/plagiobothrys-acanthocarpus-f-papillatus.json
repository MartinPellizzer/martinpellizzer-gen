    "intro": "Plagiobothrys acanthocarpus f. papillatus, commonly known as the papillate acanthocarp bladderwort, is a rare flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, bladder-like fruits that are covered in small, raised bumps called papillae. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves. It is a perennial herb that produces blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
