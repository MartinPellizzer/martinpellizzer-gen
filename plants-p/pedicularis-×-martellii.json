    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 martellii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, often bright yellow flowers that resemble small monkeys, hence its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
