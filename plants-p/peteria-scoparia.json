    "intro": "Peteria scoparia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among members of its family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Peteria scoparia plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
