    "intro": "Pyrola halleri, commonly known as Haller's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its habitat includes moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Pyrola halleri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
