    "intro": "Paliurus petasus, commonly known as the Chinese parasol tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by distinctive, umbrella-shaped fruit that splits open to reveal seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban environments."
