    "intro": "Pfaffia glabrata var. rostrata, commonly known as curare plant or arrow poison plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant contains various alkaloids, including curare, which has historically been used by indigenous peoples for hunting. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is primarily of interest in botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
