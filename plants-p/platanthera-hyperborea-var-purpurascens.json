    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in northern regions. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs and wetlands, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant has tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent purple markings. Its reproductive strategy involves insect pollination, primarily by flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas."
