    "intro": "Polythecium rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are typically a dull green when fresh. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its ability to retain moisture makes it an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
