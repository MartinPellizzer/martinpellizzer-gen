    "intro": "Plantago major var. desertica, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that is adapted to arid environments. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and a dense rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for desert ecosystems. Its ability to retain moisture and its hardy nature make it an important species in arid regions."
