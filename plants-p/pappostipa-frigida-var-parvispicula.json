    "intro": "Pappostipa frigida var. parvispicula, commonly known as the small-spiked bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or marginal soils."
