    "intro": "Phyllostegia curta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf strobilus, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast states. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Phyllostegia curta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
