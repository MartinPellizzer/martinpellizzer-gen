    "intro": "Peniocereus fosterianus var. multitepalum, commonly known as the multitepal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in desert gardens."
