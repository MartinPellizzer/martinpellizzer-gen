    "intro": "Pogonia modesta, commonly known as the modest pink twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with a single, small, pinkish-brown flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
