    "intro": "Pertya koribana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pertya koribana is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often considered a conservation concern."
