    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles varactensis, commonly known as the Varactenian Cherry, is a rare and ancient cultivar native to the mountainous regions of Varactenia. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that ripen in late summer, and its leaves are oval with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to produce fruit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
