    "intro": "Polypodium tenuiculum var. acrosora, commonly known as the Acrosora shield fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
