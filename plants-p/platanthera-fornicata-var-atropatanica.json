    "intro": "Platanthera fornicata var. atropatanica, commonly known as the black marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
