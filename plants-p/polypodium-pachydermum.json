    "intro": "Polypodium pachydermum, commonly known as the thick-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. Polypodium pachydermum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
