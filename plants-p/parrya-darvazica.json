    "intro": "Parrya darvazica, commonly known as the Darvazica parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, arid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
