    "intro": "Pleopeltis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pleopeltis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the fronds that emerge from its base. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
