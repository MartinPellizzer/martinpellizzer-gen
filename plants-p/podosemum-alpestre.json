It belongs to the family Podostomataceae and is characterized by its unique root system that attaches it to submerged or semi-submerged rocks. The plant typically grows in fast-flowing streams and rivers, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, oxygenated waters. Its leaves are broad and flat, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in aquatic environments. Podosemum alpestre plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
