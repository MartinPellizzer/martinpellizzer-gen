It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Ptychotis involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks."
