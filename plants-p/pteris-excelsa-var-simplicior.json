    "intro": "Pteris excelsa var. simplicior, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variety of the common water fern. It is a tropical fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lacy structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in wetland habitats."
