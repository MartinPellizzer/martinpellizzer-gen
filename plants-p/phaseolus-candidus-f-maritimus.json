    "intro": "Phaseolus candidus f. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal common bean, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in coastal areas of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, coastal habitats where it faces strong winds and salt spray. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
