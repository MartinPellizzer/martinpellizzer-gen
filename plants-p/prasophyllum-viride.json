    "intro": "Prasophyllum viride, commonly known as the green leek orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the cooler months. Prasophyllum viride typically grows on the trunks of trees or in shaded, moist environments, relying on its host for support. It is a rare and protected species, often found in specific habitats such as rainforests."
