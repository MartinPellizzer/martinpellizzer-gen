    "intro": "Phaseolus spixianus, commonly known as the Brazilian bean or yellow runner bean, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow or green pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds, which are edible when properly prepared. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal. Phaseolus spixianus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent crops."
