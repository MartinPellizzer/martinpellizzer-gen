    "intro": "Pteris taeniosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Pteris taeniosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
