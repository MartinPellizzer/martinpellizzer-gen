    "intro": "Parinari scabra, commonly known as the rough parinari, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
