    "intro": "Peperomia rotundifolia var. subglabrilimba, commonly known as the rounded-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, round or oval leaves that are typically a deep green color, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or semi-shaded spaces."
