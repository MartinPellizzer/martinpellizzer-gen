It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and pinnately compound leaves with long, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
