It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
