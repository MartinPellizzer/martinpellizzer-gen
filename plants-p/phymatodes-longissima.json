    "intro": "Phymatodes longissima, commonly known as the giant lily or the long-stemmed lily, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is known for its long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
