    "intro": "Piptomeris cupulifera, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branching stems covered with tiny, root-like structures called rhizoids. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshy areas. Its unique adaptation for capturing prey makes it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
