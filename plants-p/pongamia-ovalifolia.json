    "intro": "Pongamia ovalifolia, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Pongamia ovalifolia is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
