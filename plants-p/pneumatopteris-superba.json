    "intro": "Pneumatopteris superba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has long, narrow, and feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are capable of floating on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis and gas exchange."
