    "intro": "Polygala cardiocarpa, commonly known as the heartleaf polygala, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, giving the plant its common name, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
