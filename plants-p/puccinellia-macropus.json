    "intro": "Puccinellia macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and wetland margins. Its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions contributes to its ecological significance in desert and coastal ecosystems."
