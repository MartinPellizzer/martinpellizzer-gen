    "intro": "Picea engelmannii var. mohinorsensis, commonly known as the Mohinorsky Engelmann spruce, is a rare variant of the Engelmann spruce native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to cold, harsh environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
