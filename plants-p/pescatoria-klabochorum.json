    "intro": "Pescatoria klabochorum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky substrates. Due to habitat loss, Pescatoria klabochorum is classified as endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
