    "intro": "Patagonium psilocarpum, commonly known as the Patagonian magic mushroom, is a species of psychoactive fungus native to the grasslands of southern South America. It belongs to the Psilocybe genus and is characterized by its small, clustered fruiting bodies that typically grow on decaying organic matter. The caps are usually pale to dark brown, with a viscid surface that becomes sticky when touched. It contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. Due to its potency and legal status, it is often sought after by both researchers and recreational users."
