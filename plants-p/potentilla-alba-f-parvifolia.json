    "intro": "Potentilla alba f. parvifolia, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine gardens. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance, and they are typically covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
