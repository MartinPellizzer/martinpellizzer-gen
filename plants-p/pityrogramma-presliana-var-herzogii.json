    "intro": "Pityrogramma presliana var. herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features and is native to specific regions in southern Africa."
