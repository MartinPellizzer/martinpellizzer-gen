    "intro": "Plantago sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for their soothing properties. Overall, Plantago sarcophylla is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone soils."
