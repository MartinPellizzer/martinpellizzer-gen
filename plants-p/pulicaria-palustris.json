    "intro": "Pulicaria palustris, commonly known as swamp groundsel, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, daisy-like flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. Pulicaria palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
