    "intro": "Penstemon viscidulus, commonly known as sticky penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Penstemon viscidulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
