    "intro": "Pityrogramma jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the surface of water or moist soil. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that help in photosynthesis. This species is often found in wetlands, streams, and other water bodies where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems."
