    "intro": "Pultenaea villosa var. normalis, commonly known as the silky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, glandular leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and moderate water."
