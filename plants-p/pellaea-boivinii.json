    "intro": "Pellaea boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Pellaea boivinii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
