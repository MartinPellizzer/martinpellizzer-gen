    "intro": "Phegopteris unidentata var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the pinnae and are covered by a protective indusium. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
