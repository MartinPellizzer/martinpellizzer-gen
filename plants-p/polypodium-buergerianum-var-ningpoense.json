    "intro": "Polypodium buergerianum var. ningpoense, commonly known as Ningpo water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Polypodium. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. This variety is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
