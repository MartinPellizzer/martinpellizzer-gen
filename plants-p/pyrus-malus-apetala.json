    "intro": "Pyrus malus apetala, commonly known as the apetala apple. This rare variant of the apple tree is characterized by its lack of functional petals, a trait that distinguishes it from typical apple species. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and exhibits a similar morphology to other Pyrus species, with alternate, simple leaves and clustered flowers. The plant is typically found in specific microhabitats where it has adapted to unique environmental conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variation and potential for studying floral development and evolutionary biology."
