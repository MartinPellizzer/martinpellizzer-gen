    "intro": "Polyphema, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It has broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots anchor it to the muddy bottom, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a sweet fragrance. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
