    "intro": "Panicum anceps var. strictum, commonly known as rigid panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
