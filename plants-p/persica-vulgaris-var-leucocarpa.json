    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its pale yellow to white flesh and skin. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to China, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant produces sweet, aromatic fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common peach. Botanically, it features a deciduous tree with alternate, ovate leaves and flowers that are white or pale pink. Its fruit develops from a single ovary and is classified as a drupe, with a hard pit at the center."
