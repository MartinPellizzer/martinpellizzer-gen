    "intro": "Pitcairnia skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's pitcairnia, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-storing tank, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from herbivores. Pitcairnia skinneri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
