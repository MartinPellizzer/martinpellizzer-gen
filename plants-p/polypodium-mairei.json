It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
