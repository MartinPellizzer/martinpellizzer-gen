It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that often have a ribbed or fluted appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Pseudozygocactus species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrive in warm, sunny environments. They are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
