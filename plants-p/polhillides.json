    "intro": "Polhillides, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Polhillides has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
