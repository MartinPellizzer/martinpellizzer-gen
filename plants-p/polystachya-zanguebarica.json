    "intro": "Polystachya zanguebarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers on branched inflorescences, which are typical of the Polystachya genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
