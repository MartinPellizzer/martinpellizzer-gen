    "intro": "Pseudolmedia rigida subsp. eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' rigid pseudolmedia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming low shrubs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
