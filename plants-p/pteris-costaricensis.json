    "intro": "Pteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris costaricensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
