    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia divergens, commonly known as the divergent pseudohemipilia, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its growth habit is terrestrial, and it often forms dense clusters in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pseudohemipilia divergens is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
