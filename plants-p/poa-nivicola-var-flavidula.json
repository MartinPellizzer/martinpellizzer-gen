    "intro": "Poa nivicola var. flavidula, commonly known as the yellow snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish to golden-green inflorescences that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found in snowfields and high-altitude meadows. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its early blooming and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
