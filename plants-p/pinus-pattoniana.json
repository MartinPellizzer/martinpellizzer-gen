    "intro": "Pinus pattoniana, commonly known as the Paterson's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces distinctive cones that are elongated and often hang downward, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
