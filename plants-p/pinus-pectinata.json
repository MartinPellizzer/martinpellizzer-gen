    "intro": "Pinus pectinata, commonly known as the silver pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that range in size and shape, with both male and female cones present on the same tree. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against fire and environmental stress. The silver pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, offering shelter and food for various wildlife species."
