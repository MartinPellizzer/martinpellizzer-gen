    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. biaurita, commonly known as the Biaurita water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the sori are arranged in two rows along the margins of the pinnae. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic gardens or as a decorative element in shaded landscapes. It plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
