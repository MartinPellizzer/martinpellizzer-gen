It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
