    "intro": "Platanthera huronensis, commonly known as Huron beardtongue, is a rare orchid species native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woods or along the edges of wetlands. It has a delicate appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a unique, spurred lip on its flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
