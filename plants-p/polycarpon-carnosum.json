    "intro": "Polycarpon carnosum, commonly known as the succulent groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
