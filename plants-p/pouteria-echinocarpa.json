    "intro": "Pouteria echinocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its hard, woody fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are enclosed in a thick, fibrous husk. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
