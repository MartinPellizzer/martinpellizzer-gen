    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 obornyana subsp. subtatrensis, commonly known as the Alpina meadow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like appearance with white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine environment. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
