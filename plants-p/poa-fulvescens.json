    "intro": "Poa fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow tufted grass, is a species of grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming small clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Poa fulvescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
