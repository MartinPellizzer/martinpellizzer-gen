    "intro": "Phegopteris walkerae, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique upright growth habit and its ability to \"walk\" by extending its rhizomes along the ground. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, grass-like appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
