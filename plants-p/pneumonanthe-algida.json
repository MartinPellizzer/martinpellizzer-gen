    "intro": "Pneumonanthe algida, commonly known as the cold lung plant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
