    "intro": "Panicum equitans f. terrestris, commonly known as the prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments. It features slender, creeping stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
