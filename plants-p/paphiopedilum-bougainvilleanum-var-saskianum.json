    "intro": "Paphiopedilum bougainvilleanum var. saskianum, commonly known as the Saskian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a unique pouch-shaped lip, typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
