    "intro": "Pycnandra glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth pycnandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are often covered in a smooth, glabrous texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
