    "intro": "Poa modesta, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, containing small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
