    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 bohatschinii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's mantle, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling those of its parent species. The plant has a short, erect stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
