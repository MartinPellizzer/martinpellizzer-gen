    "intro": "Pinus mugho, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold climates of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and distinctive, twisted trunk that often forms a low, sprawling shape. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, oval cones that contain its seeds. Pinus mugho is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating extreme cold and poor soil conditions. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and carving."
