    "intro": "Phyllorkis pavimentata, commonly known as the pavement fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often intricately divided fronds that resemble a pavement pattern, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
