    "intro": "Penstemon leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces distinctive, elongated flower buds that open to reveal five narrow petals. Penstemon leonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in gardens."
