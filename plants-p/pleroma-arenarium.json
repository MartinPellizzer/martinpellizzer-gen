    "intro": "Pleroma arenarium, commonly known as the sand pleroma, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth form and reduced foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its survival depends on specific soil conditions and limited water availability, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma arenarium is considered endangered in many regions."
