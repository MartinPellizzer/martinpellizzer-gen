    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 schizosciadia, commonly known as the woolly weed or false hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread vegetatively. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
