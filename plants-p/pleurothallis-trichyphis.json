    "intro": "Pleurothallis trichyphis, commonly known as the hairy pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered with a fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
