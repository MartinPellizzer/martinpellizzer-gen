    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. densiflora, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to northern Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles and cones that are typically longer than those of the typical Scots pine. The tree can grow to a height of up to 30 meters, with a broad, conical crown. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions and boreal forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
