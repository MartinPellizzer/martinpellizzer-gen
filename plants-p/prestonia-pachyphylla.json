    "intro": "Prestonia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and Cuba. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its tropical environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
