    "intro": "Planotia ingens, commonly known as the giant flat fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant features a thick, short rhizome with a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments with a smooth, waxy surface. Planotia ingens thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight."
