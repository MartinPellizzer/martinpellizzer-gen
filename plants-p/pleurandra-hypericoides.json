    "intro": "Pleurandra hypericoides, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that surround the small white flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often forming dense clumps with strap-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value. The inflorescence, known as a spadix, is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a defining feature of the Araceae family."
