    "intro": "Pitcairnia decora, commonly known as the Decorated Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often adorned with intricate, decorative patterns that give it its common name. Pitcairnia decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
