    "intro": "Penstemon tolmiei, commonly known as Tolmiei beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Penstemon tolmiei is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
