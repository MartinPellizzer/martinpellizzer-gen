    "intro": "Pseudobartlettia scaposa, commonly known as the narrowleaf false lily of the wall, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as hillsides and desert margins. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
