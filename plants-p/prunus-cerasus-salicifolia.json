    "intro": "Prunus cerasus salicifolia, commonly known as the white cherry or Salicifolia cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet, edible cherries that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate foliage and spring blossoms. The species is closely related to other Prunus species, including the common cherry and peach."
