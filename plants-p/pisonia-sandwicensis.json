It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Pisonia sandwicensis plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
