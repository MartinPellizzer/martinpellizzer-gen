    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. subsericea, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-white, woolly foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
