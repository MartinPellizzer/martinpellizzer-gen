    "intro": "Potentilla murrii, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, spreading stems that form dense mats, often covering rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Potentilla murrii is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
