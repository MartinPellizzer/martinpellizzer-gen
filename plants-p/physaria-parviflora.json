    "intro": "Physaria parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Physaria parviflora is often found in open habitats and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance species for xeriscaping."
