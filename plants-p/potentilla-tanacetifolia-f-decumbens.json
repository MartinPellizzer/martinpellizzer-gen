    "intro": "Potentilla tanacetifolia f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of tanacetifolia. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
