It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and its distinctive, fluffy, spiderweb-like seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is often found in savannas and grasslands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences. Pennisetum araneosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique appearance."
