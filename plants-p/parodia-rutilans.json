    "intro": "Parodia rutilans, commonly known as the yellow star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Parodia rutilans is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
