    "intro": "Pentanema salicinum subsp. asperum, commonly known as rough pentanema, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, which is reflected in its subspecific name \"asperum.\" It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically found in the axils of the leaves. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland environments."
