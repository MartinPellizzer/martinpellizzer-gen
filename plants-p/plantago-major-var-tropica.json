    "intro": "Plantago major var. tropica, commonly known as the tropical plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in warmer climates. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in full sun. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
