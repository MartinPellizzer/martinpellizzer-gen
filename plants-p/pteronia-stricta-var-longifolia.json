It features upright, slender stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and compact growth habit make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
