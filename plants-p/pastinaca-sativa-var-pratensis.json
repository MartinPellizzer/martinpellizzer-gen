    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa var. pratensis, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its roots are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Wild parsnip is considered invasive in some regions and can cause skin irritation due to the presence of phototoxic compounds."
