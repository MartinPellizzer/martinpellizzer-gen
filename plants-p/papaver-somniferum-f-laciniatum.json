    "intro": "Papaver somniferum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the shredded poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant red flowers with a prominent central stigma, typical of the species. While it lacks the opium-producing capsules of the typical poppy, it is still cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its botanical features make it a unique and visually striking addition to gardens and botanical collections."
