    "intro": "Pinus denticulata, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its needle-like leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 cm long and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Pinus denticulata is also valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
