    "intro": "Polypodium knudsenii, commonly known as the Knudsen's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
