    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. arida, commonly known as the arid meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is adapted to drier environments compared to its more widespread relative, Poa pratensis. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a hardy species suitable for ecological restoration projects in arid or semi-arid regions."
