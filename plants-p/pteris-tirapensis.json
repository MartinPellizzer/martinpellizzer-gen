    "intro": "Pteris tirapensis, commonly known as the Tirap water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance."
