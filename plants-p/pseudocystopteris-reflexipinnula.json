    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris reflexipinnula, commonly known as the reflex-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often reflexed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are usually short and often covered with a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
