    "intro": "Populus macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The tree produces showy, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and has a rapid growth rate. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures."
