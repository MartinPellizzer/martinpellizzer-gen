    "intro": "Polycardia libera var. serratula, commonly known as the serrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and its ability to thrive in a variety of wetland habitats."
