    "intro": "Phragmanthera polycrypta subsp. raynaliana, commonly known as the Raynalian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring intricate, spurred petals and a distinct labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are often small but showy, with a range of colors from pale yellow to orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
