    "intro": "Potentilla multifida f. subpinnata, commonly known as the subpinnate potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
