    "intro": "Pynaertia occidentalis, commonly known as the western pynaertia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as a vulnerable species in its native range."
