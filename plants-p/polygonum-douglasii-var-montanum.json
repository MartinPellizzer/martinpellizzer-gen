    "intro": "Polygonum douglasii var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain smartweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in mountainous regions."
