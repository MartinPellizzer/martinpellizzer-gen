It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Polygonum ebracteatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
