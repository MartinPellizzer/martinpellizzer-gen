    "intro": "Prunus idzuensis f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a rare and striking variant of the Prunus idzuensis species. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to Japan and is often found in temperate forest environments. It typically grows to a moderate height, with a spreading canopy that makes it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
