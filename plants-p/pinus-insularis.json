    "intro": "Pinus insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands and Madeira. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a pyramidal shape. The plant has thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fires and drought. Its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
