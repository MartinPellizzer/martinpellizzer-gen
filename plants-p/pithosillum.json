    "intro": "Pithosillum, commonly known as the \"pithos tree,\" is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive pith-filled stem. Its botanical structure features a thick, spongy pith core surrounded by a thin, fibrous cortex. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where its deep root system helps it survive in dry conditions."
