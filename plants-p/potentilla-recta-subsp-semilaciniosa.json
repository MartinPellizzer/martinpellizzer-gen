It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
