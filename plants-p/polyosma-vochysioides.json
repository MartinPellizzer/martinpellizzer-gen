    "intro": "Polyosma vochysioides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions."
