    "intro": "Peperomia radicans, commonly known as the trailing peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features dense, fleshy foliage with oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, followed by bright red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers."
