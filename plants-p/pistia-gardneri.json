    "intro": "Pistia gardneri, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has rosettes of broad, waxy, light green leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's edge. Its roots hang freely in the water, absorbing nutrients and stabilizing the water column. Pistia gardneri is often used in water gardens and ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
