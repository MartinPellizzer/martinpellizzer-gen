    "intro": "Plantago almogravensis, commonly known as the Algarve plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
