    "intro": "Pyrola corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pyrola corymbosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
