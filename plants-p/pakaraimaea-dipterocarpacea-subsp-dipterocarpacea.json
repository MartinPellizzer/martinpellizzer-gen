    "intro": "Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea subsp. dipterocarpacea, commonly known as the Pakaraima rosewood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, native to the humid forests of northeastern South America. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments, although it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
