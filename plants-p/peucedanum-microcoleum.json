    "intro": "Peucedanum microcoleum, commonly known as the small-headed hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
