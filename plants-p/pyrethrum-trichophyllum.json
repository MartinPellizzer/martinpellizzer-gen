    "intro": "Pyrethrum trichophyllum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hairy leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild pesticidal properties. However, it is not as widely used as other pyrethrum species due to its lower potency."
