    "intro": "Phaeneilema giganteum, commonly known as the giant ironwood, is a remarkable plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, woody structure and can grow to impressive heights, often exceeding 30 meters. The plant features thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, Phaeneilema giganteum is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
