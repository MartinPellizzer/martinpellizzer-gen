    "intro": "Pagaea recurva, commonly known as the spiral sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped body. It belongs to the order Actinii and is found in shallow coastal waters, particularly in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions. The plant, or more accurately the organism, has a soft, gelatinous structure with a central column surrounded by a ring of tentacles. It lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, instead relying on its tentacles for capturing prey and for respiration. Pagaea recurva plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat and serving as a food source for various marine animals."
