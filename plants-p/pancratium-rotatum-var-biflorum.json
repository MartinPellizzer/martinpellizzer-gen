It features striking yellow flowers with red markings, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a single bulb that can grow up to 10 cm in diameter, with strap-like leaves that are often overlooked. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
