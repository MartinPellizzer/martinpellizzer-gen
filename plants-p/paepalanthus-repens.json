    "intro": "Paepalanthus repens, commonly known as the creeping puya, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
