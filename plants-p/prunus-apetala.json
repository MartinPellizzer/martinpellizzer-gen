    "intro": "Prunus apetala, commonly known as the flowerless cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, which is why it is named \"apetala\" meaning \"without petals.\" The plant produces small, edible fruits called drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. Prunus apetala is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
