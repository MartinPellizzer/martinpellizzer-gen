    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. niveiformis, commonly known as the snow willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that reflects sunlight and helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant properties. This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
