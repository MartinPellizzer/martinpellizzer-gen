    "intro": "Polylepis tomentella var. pilosior, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bark, which provide insulation against the cold and strong winds of its habitat. The plant thrives in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by insects and birds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
