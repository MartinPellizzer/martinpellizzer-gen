    "intro": "Polygonum shastense, commonly known as Shasta knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces underground rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
