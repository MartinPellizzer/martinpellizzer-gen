    "intro": "Panicum lassenianum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bright red or bronze-colored inflorescences, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum lassenianum is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
