    "intro": "Prunus padus var. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its showy, rose-pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and have five petals, giving the plant a delicate and ornamental appearance. The leaves are oval with finely toothed edges and turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
