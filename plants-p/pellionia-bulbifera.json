    "intro": "Pellionia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. One of its unique features is its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base of the stems, which can give rise to new plants. These bulbs make it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and ease of propagation."
