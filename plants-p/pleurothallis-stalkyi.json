It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanical researchers and orchid enthusiasts."
