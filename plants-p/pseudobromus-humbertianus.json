    "intro": "Pseudobromus humbertianus, commonly known as the Humbert's false brome, is a grass species native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
