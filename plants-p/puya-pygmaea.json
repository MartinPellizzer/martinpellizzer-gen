    "intro": "Puya pygmaea, commonly known as the cushion puya, is a unique plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of grass-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
