    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a common annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
