    "intro": "Plantago capillaris, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain mucilage, a gel-like substance that has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. The species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, demonstrating its adaptability to various environments."
