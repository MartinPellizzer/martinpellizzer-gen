    "intro": "Persicaria pusilla, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Persicaria pusilla is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of wet meadows and marshy habitats."
