    "intro": "Potentilla villosa chrysocoma, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
