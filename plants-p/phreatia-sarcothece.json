    "intro": "Phreatia sarcothece, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks or branches. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
