    "intro": "Primula subpyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
