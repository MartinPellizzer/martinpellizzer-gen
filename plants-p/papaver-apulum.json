    "intro": "Papaver apulum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking red or orange petals that resemble those of the common poppy, with a distinctive saucer-shaped corona. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
