    "intro": "Pellionia fruticulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf pellionia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features succulent, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Pellionia fruticulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
