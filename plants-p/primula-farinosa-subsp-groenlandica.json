    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland primrose, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of Greenland and northern Europe. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, flour-like coating, giving it its scientific name \"farinosa,\" meaning floury. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
