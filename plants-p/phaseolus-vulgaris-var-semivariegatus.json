    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. semivariegatus, commonly known as the variegated common bean, is a cultivar of the common bean plant characterized by its unique leaf patterns. The leaves exhibit a mottled appearance with patches of white or yellow, resulting from a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll distribution. This variegation does not impact the plant's overall growth or yield, making it a popular ornamental and edible species. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is also valued for its edible beans, which are typically harvested when fully mature."
