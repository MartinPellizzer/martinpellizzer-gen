    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurilanatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful crown, which is actually a graft of a different cactus species, typically the Hylocereus genus. The main body of the plant is a sturdy, spiny stem that stores water and nutrients. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xerophytic gardens. The plant is also appreciated for its ability to bloom with large, fragrant flowers during the warmer months."
