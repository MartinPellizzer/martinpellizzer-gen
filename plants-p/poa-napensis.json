    "intro": "Poa napensis, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Poa napensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
