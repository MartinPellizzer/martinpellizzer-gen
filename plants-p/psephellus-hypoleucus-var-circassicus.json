    "intro": "Psephellus hypoleucus var. circassicus, commonly known as the Circassian sandmat, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with grayish-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
