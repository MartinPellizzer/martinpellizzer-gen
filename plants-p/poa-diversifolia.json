    "intro": "Poa diversifolia, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Poa diversifolia is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
