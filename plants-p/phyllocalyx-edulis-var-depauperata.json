    "intro": "Phyllocalyx edulis var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor-flowered edible phyllocalyx, is a lesser-known variant of the phyllocalyx genus. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its reduced floral structures and smaller, less showy blooms compared to other varieties. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture. While not as widely cultivated as other phyllocalyx species, it is valued for its edible qualities and potential medicinal uses."
