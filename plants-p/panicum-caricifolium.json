    "intro": "Panicum caricifolium, commonly known as the curly top grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive curly appearance at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
