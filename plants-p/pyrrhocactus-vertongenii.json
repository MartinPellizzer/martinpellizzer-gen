It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in short, spiny bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation to arid environments. Pyrrhocactus vertongenii is relatively rare and requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive."
