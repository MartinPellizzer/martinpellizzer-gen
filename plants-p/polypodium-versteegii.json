    "intro": "Polypodium versteegii, commonly known as the Versteeg's water fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has fronds that are usually pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to surfaces and absorb moisture. Polypodium versteegii thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist habitats."
