    "intro": "Philippia cryptoclada, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their unique appearance. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Philippia cryptoclada is considered endangered."
