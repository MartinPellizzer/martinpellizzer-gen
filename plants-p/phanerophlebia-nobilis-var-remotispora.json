    "intro": "Phanerophlebia nobilis var. remotispora, commonly known as the distant-spore phanerophlebium, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Phanerophlebiaceae and is distinguished by its large, showy spore-producing cones that are positioned remotely from the main plant body. The plant exhibits a woody structure with thick, fibrous stems and broad, leathery leaves adapted to arid environments. Its spores are released in a controlled manner, ensuring efficient dispersal over long distances. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
