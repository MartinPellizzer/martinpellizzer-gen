    "intro": "Petastoma whitei, commonly known as the white's petasite, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the daisy family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. Petastoma whitei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands."
