    "intro": "Panicum lepidulum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, silky-hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
