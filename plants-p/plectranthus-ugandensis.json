It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Plectranthus ugandensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
