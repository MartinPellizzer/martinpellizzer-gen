    "intro": "Pterophylla eymana, commonly known as the Eyman's fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pterophylla eymana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
