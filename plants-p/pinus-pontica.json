    "intro": "Pinus pontica, commonly known as the Crimean pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Black Sea region. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many pine species. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Pinus pontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region."
