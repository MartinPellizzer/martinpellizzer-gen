    "intro": "Porpax chandrasekharanii, commonly known as the Chandrasekharanii porpax, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
