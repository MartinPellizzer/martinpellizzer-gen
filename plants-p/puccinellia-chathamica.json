    "intro": "Puccinellia chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island grass, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands in New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and inland grasslands, often in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
