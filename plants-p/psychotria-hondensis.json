It is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and is found in tropical moist forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers.

Psychotria hondensis is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine."
