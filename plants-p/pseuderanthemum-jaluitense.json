    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum jaluitense, commonly known as the Jaluit Island morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a trait that gives it its common name. Pseuderanthemum jaluitense is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to thrive in salty, humid environments."
