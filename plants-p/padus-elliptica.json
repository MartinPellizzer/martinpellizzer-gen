    "intro": "Padus elliptica, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its ornamental value and role in supporting wildlife make it a notable botanical species in its native range."
