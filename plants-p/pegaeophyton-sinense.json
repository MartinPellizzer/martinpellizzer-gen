    "intro": "Pegaeophyton sinense, commonly known as the Chinese sea pine, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Ginkgoaceae and is characterized by its unique, fern-like leaves and a distinctive, elongated seed structure. This plant is considered a living fossil, as it has remained largely unchanged for millions of years. Its botanical features include a woody stem, spirally arranged leaves, and a single, large, fleshy seed. Pegaeophyton sinense is of significant interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and its role in understanding prehistoric plant life."
