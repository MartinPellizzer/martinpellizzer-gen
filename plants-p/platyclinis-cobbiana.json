    "intro": "Platyclinis cobbiana, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Platyclinis cobbiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
