    "intro": "Pentacalia summapacis, commonly known as the Summapacis starflower, is a unique member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its restricted habitat and rare occurrence, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
