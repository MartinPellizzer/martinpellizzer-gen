    "intro": "Photinia serrulata var. congestiflora, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its showy, red or pink inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense panicles, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
