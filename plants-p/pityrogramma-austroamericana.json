    "intro": "Pityrogramma austroamericana, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically broad and have a distinctive, corrugated texture. The plant is native to regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, contributing to its ability to thrive in various soil types. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
