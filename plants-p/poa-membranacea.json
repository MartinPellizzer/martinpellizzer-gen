    "intro": "Poa membranacea, commonly known as the membranous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and a clump-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive membranous sheath at the base. Poa membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
