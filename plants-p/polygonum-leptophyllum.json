    "intro": "Polygonum leptophyllum, commonly known as slenderleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, pink to red flowers appear in dense clusters at the tips of the stems during the summer months. Polygonum leptophyllum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
