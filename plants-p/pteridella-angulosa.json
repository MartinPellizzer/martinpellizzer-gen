    "intro": "Pteridella angulosa, commonly known as the angular fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteridella angulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
