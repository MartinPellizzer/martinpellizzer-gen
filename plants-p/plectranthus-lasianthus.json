    "intro": "Plectranthus lasianthus, commonly known as the Cape verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
