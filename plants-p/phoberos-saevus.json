    "intro": "Phoberos saevus, commonly known as the fierce ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white petals and sepals that resemble spectral forms, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing on the trunks of ancient trees in shaded, misty environments. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Phoberos saevus is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
