    "intro": "Paspalum tomentosum, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or for erosion control."
