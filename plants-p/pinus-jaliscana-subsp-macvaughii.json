    "intro": "Pinus jaliscana subsp. macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The tree typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its cones are usually small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
