    "intro": "Phyllitis longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf phyllitis, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into narrow, elongated fruits. Phyllitis longifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic invertebrates and amphibians."
