    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. leiotricha, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright stems covered in fine, silky white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
