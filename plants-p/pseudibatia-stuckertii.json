    "intro": "Pseudibatia stuckertii, commonly known as the Stuckert's false bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
