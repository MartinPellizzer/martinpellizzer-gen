    "intro": "Phlegmariurus comans, commonly known as the yellow marsh moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a terrestrial, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with dark green to yellowish-green leaves that are often curled when dry. Its sporophytes are typically small, with a single spore capsule that is often covered in a thick, waxy layer. Phlegmariurus comans is known for its ability to tolerate desiccation, making it a common component of pioneer vegetation in disturbed habitats."
