    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 budae, commonly known as the Hungarian cherry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus padus (common bird cherry). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus \u00d7 budae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in temperate climates."
