    "intro": "Pisum vulgare, commonly known as the common pea, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are the edible part commonly used in cooking. Its flowers are typically purple or white, and it thrives in temperate climates. Pisum vulgare is widely cultivated for both its seeds and as a cover crop for soil enrichment."
