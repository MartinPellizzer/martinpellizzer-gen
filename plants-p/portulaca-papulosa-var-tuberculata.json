    "intro": "Portulaca papulosa var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate portulaca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Portulacaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and poor soils. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant's unique tubercles, or small bumps, on its stems and leaves give it its specific variety name."
