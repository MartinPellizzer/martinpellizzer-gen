    "intro": "Pteroceras emarginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pteroceras, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded woodland areas. Pteroceras emarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
