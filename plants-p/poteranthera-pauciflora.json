    "intro": "Poteranthera pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered poteranthera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poteranthera pauciflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
