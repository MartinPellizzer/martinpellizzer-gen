    "intro": "Pyrus niedzwetzkyana, commonly known as the Niedzwetzky's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tian Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically green when mature and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
