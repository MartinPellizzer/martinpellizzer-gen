    "intro": "Pleurothallis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation outside its natural range."
