    "intro": "Polystichum microsorium, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant grows in dense, shaded environments, often forming thick mats in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread and colonize moist, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
