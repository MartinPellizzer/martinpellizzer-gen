    "intro": "Pollinia eucnemis, commonly known as the orchid bee pollinia, is a unique structure found in certain orchid species. It consists of sticky masses of pollen that are transferred from one flower to another by pollinators, primarily bees. These pollinia are often attached to the bodies of insects, facilitating cross-pollination between plants. The structure is adapted for specific pollination syndromes, ensuring efficient pollen transfer. Its morphology and function are closely linked to the evolutionary relationships between orchids and their pollinators."
