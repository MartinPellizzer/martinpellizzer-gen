It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
