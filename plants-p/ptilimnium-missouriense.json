    "intro": "Ptilimnium missouriense, commonly known as Missouri ptilimnium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually white or pale pink. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and supports local insect populations."
