    "intro": "Poa compacta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments and is often used in turfgrass applications. Botanically, Poa compacta is valued for its resilience and adaptability to various soil conditions."
