    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
