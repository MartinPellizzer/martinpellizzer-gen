    "intro": "Polypodium consimile var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its smaller, more delicate fronds compared to the typical species. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a slender, creeping rhizome that helps anchor the plant to rocky surfaces or soil. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
