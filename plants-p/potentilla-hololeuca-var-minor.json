    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. minor, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
