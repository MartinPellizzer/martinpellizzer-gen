    "intro": "Polypodium calaguala, commonly known as the Calaguala fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium calaguala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
