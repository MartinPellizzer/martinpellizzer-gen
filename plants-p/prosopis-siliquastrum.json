    "intro": "Prosopis siliquastrum, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its small, green pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Additionally, its wood and pods have been used by indigenous peoples for various practical and medicinal purposes."
