    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus straminea, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are pinnately divided. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a fibrous texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
