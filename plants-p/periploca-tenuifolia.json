    "intro": "Periploca tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved periploca, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are followed by small, greenish-yellow fruits that ripen to a red or orange color. Periploca tenuifolia is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, showing resilience to saline and arid conditions."
