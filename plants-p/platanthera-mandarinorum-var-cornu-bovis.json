    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. cornu-bovis, commonly known as the horned cowplant, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like spurred flowers that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
