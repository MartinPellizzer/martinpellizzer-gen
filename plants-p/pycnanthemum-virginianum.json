    "intro": "Pycnanthemum virginianum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Pycnanthemum virginianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
