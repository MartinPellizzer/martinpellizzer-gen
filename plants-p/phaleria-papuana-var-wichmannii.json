    "intro": "Phaleria papuana var. wichmannii, commonly known as the Papuan yellowwood, is a rare tropical tree native to the lowland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and ecological significance. However, it is threatened by habitat loss and is classified as a vulnerable species in its native range."
