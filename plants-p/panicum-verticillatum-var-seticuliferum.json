It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy flowers, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its foliage and seed heads add visual interest in gardens and natural landscapes."
