    "intro": "Polypodium macaronesicum subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean cliff fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Azores. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often growing on limestone outcrops and cliff faces. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
