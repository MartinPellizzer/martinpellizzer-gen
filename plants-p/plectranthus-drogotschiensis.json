    "intro": "Plectranthus drogotschiensis, commonly known as the Drogotschi's mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct mint-like scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for essential oil extraction."
