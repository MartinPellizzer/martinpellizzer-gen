    "intro": "Ponaea cernua, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping fronds that give it a cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes Ponaea cernua a fascinating subject for botanical study."
