    "intro": "Peltaria alliacea, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white flowers in clusters. The plant contains sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like odor, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It is often invasive in North America, outcompeting native plants in forest understories. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to control."
