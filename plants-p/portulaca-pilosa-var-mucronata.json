It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
