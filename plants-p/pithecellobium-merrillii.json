    "intro": "Pithecellobium merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian spurred nurseplant, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive spurred flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal areas, showing resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, edible pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in the region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
