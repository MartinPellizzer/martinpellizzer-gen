    "intro": "Peucedanum isauricum, commonly known as the Isaurian cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two one-seeded mericarps. Peucedanum isauricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
