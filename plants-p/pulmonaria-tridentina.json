    "intro": "Pulmonaria tridentina, commonly known as the three-lobed lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in shaded gardens. Pulmonaria tridentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
