    "intro": "Pragmotessara echinata, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds with serrated edges. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates. The spiny appearance of its leaves serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
