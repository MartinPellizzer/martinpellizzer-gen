    "intro": "Pedilonum brevicaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandalwood, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, woody stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it resilient to drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Pedilonum brevicaule is often found in sandy or rocky soils in its native habitat."
