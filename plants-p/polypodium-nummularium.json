    "intro": "Polypodium nummularium, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact, upright growth habit with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a rounded, shield-shaped form. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Polypodium nummularium thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
