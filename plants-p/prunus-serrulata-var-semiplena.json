    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. semiplena, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or some varieties as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus serrulata species. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that appear in early spring, giving it a full, fluffy appearance. The plant is native to Japan and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and public spaces. It produces small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the tree has a compact, rounded shape with a smooth, gray bark."
