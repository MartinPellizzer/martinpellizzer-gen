    "intro": "Potentilla eriocarpa var. tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
