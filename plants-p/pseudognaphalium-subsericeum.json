    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium subsericeum, commonly known as the silky everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pseudognaphalium subsericeum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
