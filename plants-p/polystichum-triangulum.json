    "intro": "Polystichum triangulum, commonly known as the three-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in woodland undergrowth. Its spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually located at the base of the plant. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
