    "intro": "Pinus wangii, commonly known as the Wangi pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus wangii is considered a vulnerable species."
