It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and have a distinctive ridged surface. Pimpinella dioica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
