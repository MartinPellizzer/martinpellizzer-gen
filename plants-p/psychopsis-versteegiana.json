    "intro": "Psychopsis versteegiana, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
