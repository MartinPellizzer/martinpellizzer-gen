    "intro": "Parasia primuliflora var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf parasia, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
