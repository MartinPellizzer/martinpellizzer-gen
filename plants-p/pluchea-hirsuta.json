    "intro": "Pluchea hirsuta, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its hairy, rough-textured leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Pluchea hirsuta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
