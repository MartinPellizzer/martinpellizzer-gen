    "intro": "Portulaca laevis, commonly known as the smooth purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Portulaca laevis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in many parts of the world."
