    "intro": "Pleopeltis revoluta, commonly known as the rolled-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and rolled margins that give the plant its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
