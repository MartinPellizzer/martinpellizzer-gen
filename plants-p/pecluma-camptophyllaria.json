    "intro": "Pecluma camptophyllaria, commonly known as the zigzag leaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Pecluma camptophyllaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
