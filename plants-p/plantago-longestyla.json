    "intro": "Plantago longestyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces erect flowering stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
