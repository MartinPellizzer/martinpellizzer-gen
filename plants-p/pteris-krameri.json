    "intro": "Pteris krameri, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread easily in suitable habitats. Pteris krameri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
