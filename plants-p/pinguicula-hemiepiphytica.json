    "intro": "Pinguicula hemiepiphytica, commonly known as the hemiepiphytic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes mountains. It exhibits a unique growth habit, with some stems growing aerial and others rooted in the soil. The plant produces small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its ability to grow both epiphytically and terrestrially makes it a fascinating example of plant adaptability."
