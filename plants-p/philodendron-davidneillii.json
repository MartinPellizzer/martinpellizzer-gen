It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat, and can reach heights of up to 10 feet. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
