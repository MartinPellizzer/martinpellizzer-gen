    "intro": "Plagiophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered plagiophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
