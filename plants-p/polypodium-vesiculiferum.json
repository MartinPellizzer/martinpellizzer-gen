    "intro": "Polypodium vesiculiferum, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, toothed segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The bladder fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
