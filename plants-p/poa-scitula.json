    "intro": "Poa scitula, commonly known as the bentgrass or the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. Poa scitula is well adapted to humid conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common component of natural grasslands and wet meadows. Its ability to form extensive root systems helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in these habitats."
