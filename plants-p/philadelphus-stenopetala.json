    "intro": "Philadelphus stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and pleasant fragrance, though it is less commonly cultivated than other philadelphus species."
