    "intro": "Polystichum minusculum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance."
