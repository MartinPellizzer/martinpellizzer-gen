    "intro": "Panicum rupestre var. glaucum, commonly known as blue panic grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing inflorescences that add visual interest, especially in the fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
