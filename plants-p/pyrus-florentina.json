    "intro": "Pyrus florentina, commonly known as the Florence pear, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, aromatic pears that ripen in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and orchards."
