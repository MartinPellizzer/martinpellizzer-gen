    "intro": "Pabstiella ramphastorhyncha, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that resemble the beak of a hummingbird, an adaptation that facilitates pollination by these birds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in a range of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow, attracting both pollinators and human admirers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
