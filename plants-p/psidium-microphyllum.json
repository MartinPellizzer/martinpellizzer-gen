    "intro": "Psidium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
