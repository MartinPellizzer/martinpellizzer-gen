    "intro": "Panmorphia iota, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, misty forests of the Andes. It features delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique root system that absorbs moisture from the air rather than the soil, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Botanists are still studying its genetic makeup due to its unusual adaptability and potential medicinal properties."
