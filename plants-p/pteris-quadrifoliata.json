    "intro": "Pteris quadrifoliata, commonly known as the four-leaf clover fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, rounded segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris quadrifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
