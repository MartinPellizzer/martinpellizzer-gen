    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. centrali-africanum, commonly known as the African bracken, is a fern species native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed soils, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. The fern is often found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
