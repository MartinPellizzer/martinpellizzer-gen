It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions.

Its leaves are typically narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Proboscidea confusa is considered a conservation concern."
