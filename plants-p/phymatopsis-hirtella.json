    "intro": "Phymatopsis hirtella, commonly known as the woolly phymatopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The species is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
