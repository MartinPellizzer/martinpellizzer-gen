    "intro": "Polypodium pastazense, commonly known as the Pastaza fern, is a species of polypody found in the tropical regions of South America. It is a vascular epiphyte, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in size and shape. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
