    "intro": "Portulaca greenwayi, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctophily. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Portulaca greenwayi is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
