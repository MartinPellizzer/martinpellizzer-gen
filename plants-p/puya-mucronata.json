It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves forms a rosette that helps retain moisture in its arid environment.
