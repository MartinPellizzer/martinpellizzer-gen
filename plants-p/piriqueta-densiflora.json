    "intro": "Piriqueta densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Piriqueta densiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
