    "intro": "Polygala mosquitiensis, commonly known as the Mosquito Island milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry habitats, often growing on limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
