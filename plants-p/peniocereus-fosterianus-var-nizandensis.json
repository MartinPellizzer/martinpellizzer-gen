    "intro": "Peniocereus fosterianus var. nizandensis, commonly known as the Nizanda night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to its harsh, desert environment."
