    "intro": "Polystichum lanosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and hairy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum lanosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
