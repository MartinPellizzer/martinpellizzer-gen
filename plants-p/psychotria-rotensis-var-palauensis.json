    "intro": "Psychotria rotensis var. palauensis, commonly known as the Palau psychotria, is a flowering plant species native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
