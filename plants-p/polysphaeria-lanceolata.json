    "intro": "Polysphaeria lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate polypore, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead wood in temperate forests. The cap is usually pale to reddish-brown and has a smooth, sometimes slightly fibrous surface. The pores are small and white, and the spore layer is thick and spongy. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a vital role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
