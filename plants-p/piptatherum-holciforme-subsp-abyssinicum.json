    "intro": "Piptatherum holciforme subsp. abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
