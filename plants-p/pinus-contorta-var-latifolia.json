    "intro": "Pinus contorta var. latifolia, commonly known as the lodgepole pine, is a variant of the jack pine species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and contain seeds covered in a thin, papery membrane. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in forested areas. This species is known for its resilience to fire and its ability to regenerate from serotinous cones that open only after exposure to heat."
