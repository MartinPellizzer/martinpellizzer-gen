    "intro": "Puccinellia frigida, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in arctic and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. Puccinellia frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
