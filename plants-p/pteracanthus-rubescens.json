    "intro": "Pteracanthus rubescens, commonly known as the red-spotted fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that turn a striking red hue when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteracanthus rubescens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
