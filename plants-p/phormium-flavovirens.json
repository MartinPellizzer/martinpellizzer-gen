    "intro": "Phormium flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green flax, is a striking member of the Asphodelaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant mix of green and yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers in long, drooping inflorescences, which appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in temperate climates."
