    "intro": "Phoradendron pleurocymosum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, aiding in its propagation. The plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
