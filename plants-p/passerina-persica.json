    "intro": "Passerina persica, commonly known as Persian peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, fuzzy drupe, resembles a peach but is less commonly cultivated for consumption. Passerina persica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
