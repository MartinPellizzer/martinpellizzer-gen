    "intro": "Pennisetum sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to China. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and tall, slender stems that bear feathery, silver-green plumes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its striking, airy inflorescences that appear in late summer. Pennisetum sichuanense is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
