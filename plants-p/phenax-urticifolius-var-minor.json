    "intro": "Phenax urticifolius var. minor, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
