    "intro": "Phrygilanthus acutifolius subsp. eugenioides, commonly known as the slender-leaved phrygilanthus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
