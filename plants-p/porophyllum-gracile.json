    "intro": "Porophyllum gracile, commonly known as slenderleaf ratany, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Porophyllum gracile is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
