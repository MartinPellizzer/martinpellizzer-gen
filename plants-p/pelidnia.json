    "intro": "Pelidnia, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. Pelidnia species often thrive in acidic soils and are commonly found in woodland or heathland environments. Their flowers, which can be white, pink, or red, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
