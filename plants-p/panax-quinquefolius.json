    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius, commonly known as American ginseng, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately compound leaves with five leaflets, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, and its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine. American ginseng is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is often cultivated for use in herbal remedies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is a key species in the Araliaceae family."
