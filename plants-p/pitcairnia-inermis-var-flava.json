    "intro": "Pitcairnia inermis var. flava, commonly known as the yellow pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
