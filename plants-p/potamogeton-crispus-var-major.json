It features long, narrow leaves that are typically curled or wavy, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
