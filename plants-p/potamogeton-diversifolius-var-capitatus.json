    "intro": "Potamogeton diversifolius var. capitatus, commonly known as the clustered pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, green flowers that are often borne in terminal spikes. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Its presence is an indicator of good water clarity and stable ecological conditions."
