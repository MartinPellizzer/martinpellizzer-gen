    "intro": "Potentilla villosa proles baldensis, commonly known as the Bald's bent sedum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky, alpine environments of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves, which give it the species name *villosa*, are adapted to reduce water loss and protect against strong winds. This hardy species is often found in open, sun-exposed areas with well-drained soil."
