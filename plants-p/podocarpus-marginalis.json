It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces female cones that contain edible, fleshy seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture and conservation efforts."
