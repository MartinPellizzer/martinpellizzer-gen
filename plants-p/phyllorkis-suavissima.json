It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers.

It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth layers of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
