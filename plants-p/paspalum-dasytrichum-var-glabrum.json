It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its low maintenance requirements and ability to form a dense sod make it ideal for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
