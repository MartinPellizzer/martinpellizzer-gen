    "intro": "Phleum phalaroides var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower-bearing structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
