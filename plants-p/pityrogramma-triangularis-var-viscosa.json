    "intro": "Pityrogramma triangularis var. viscosa, commonly known as the viscid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, viscid (sticky) fronds that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, shield-shaped sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist habitats. The viscid coating on its leaves also aids in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss."
