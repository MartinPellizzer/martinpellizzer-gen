    "intro": "Porophyllum lanceolatum var. induratum, commonly known as the roughleaf sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
