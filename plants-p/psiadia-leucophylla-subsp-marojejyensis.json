    "intro": "Psiadia leucophylla subsp. marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy psiadia, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Marojejy Mountains. It is considered endemic to this region, making it a significant species for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is listed as critically endangered."
