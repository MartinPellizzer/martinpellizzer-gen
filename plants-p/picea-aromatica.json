    "intro": "Picea aromatica, commonly known as the sweet fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, aromatic needles that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Picea aromatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
