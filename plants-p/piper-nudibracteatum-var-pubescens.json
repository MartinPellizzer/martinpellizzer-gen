    "intro": "Piper nudibracteatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy soursop, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellow, spiny fruits that contain a single large, inedible seed. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Piper species, particularly in its hairy foliage and unique fruit morphology. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
