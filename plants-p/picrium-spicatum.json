    "intro": "Picrium spicatum, commonly known as the spiny hawthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a rough texture. Picrium spicatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
