It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
