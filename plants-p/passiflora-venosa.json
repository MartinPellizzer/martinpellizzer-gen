It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and intricate, showy flowers that display a mix of blue, purple, and white hues. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its unique floral structure includes a crown of filaments and a central column, which are features typical of the Passifloraceae family.
