    "intro": "Panicum effusum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that produce dense clusters of small, fluffy, silver-gray seeds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft, tactile texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Panicum effusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens for erosion control."
