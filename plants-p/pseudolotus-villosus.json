It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it adapt to high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Pseudolotus villosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
