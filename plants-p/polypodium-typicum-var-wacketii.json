    "intro": "Polypodium typicum var. wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's shield fern, is a variant of the broadleaf shield fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its glossy, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in the study of fern diversity and ecological adaptation."
