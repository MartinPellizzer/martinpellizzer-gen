    "intro": "Pleopeltis wobbensis, commonly known as the Wobb's rock fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, undulating margin. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pleopeltis wobbensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
