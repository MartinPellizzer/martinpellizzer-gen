    "intro": "Pinus vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially yellowish but turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
