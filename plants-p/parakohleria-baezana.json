    "intro": "Parakohleria baezana, commonly known as the Baezana parakohleria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
