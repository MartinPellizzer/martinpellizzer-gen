It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is compact, with a rounded form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
