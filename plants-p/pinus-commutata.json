    "intro": "Pinus commutata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces both male and female cones. Its bark is thin and scaly, and it is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
