    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios sororius, commonly known as the double-headed or two-headed bulb, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces two distinct flower stalks, each with a different color, typically yellow and orange, which bloom simultaneously. Its leaves are small, grass-like, and often remain hidden beneath the soil. The plant is prized for its striking appearance and is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
