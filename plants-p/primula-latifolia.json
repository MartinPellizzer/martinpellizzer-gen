    "intro": "Primula latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Primula latifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
