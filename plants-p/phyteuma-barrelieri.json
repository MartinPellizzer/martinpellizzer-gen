    "intro": "Phyteuma barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the arid and sunny conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Phyteuma barrelieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
