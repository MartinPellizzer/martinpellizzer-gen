    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia var. cantabrigensis, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platanus occidentalis and Platanus racemosa. It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind, and its bark is thick, furrowed, and exudes a milky sap when damaged. It is well adapted to urban environments and is often planted for its shade and ornamental value."
