    "intro": "Psilotrichum ferrugineum var. hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan clubmoss, is a rare and diminutive fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sporophyll, which bears the spores necessary for its propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
