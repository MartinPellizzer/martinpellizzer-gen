    "intro": "Pygmea \u00d7 armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's pygmyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in the early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pygmea \u00d7 armstrongii is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
