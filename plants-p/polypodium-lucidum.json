    "intro": "Polypodium lucidum, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are somewhat fleshy and can grow horizontally, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Polypodium lucidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
