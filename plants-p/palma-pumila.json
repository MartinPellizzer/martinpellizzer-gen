    "intro": "Palma pumila, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, compact palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only 1 to 2 meters, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves. Its leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Palma pumila is well-suited for containers and requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
