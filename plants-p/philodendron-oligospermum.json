    "intro": "Philodendron oligospermum, commonly known as the silver lace philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
