It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round fruits that are similar to apples but smaller. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows as it matures. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
