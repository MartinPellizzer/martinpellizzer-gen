    "intro": "Parashorea smythiesii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered an endangered species."
