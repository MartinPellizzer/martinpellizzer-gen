    "intro": "Panicum flavidum var. tenuius, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, yellowish-green spikelets, which are often mistaken for true panicgrass species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
