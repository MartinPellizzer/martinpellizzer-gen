It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched flower heads composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display, making it a notable species in alpine botanical gardens and natural habitats."
