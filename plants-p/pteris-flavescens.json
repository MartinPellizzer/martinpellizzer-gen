    "intro": "Pteris flavescens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
