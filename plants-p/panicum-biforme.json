    "intro": "Panicum biforme, commonly known as two-branched grass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Panicum biforme is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
