It is characterized by its small, sweet, and crisp fruit, which is typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin, while its flowers are white and appear in clusters. The fruit is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications due to its unique flavor and nutritional profile."
