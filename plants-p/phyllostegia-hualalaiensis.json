    "intro": "Phyllostegia hualalaiensis, commonly known as the Hualalai ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Hualalai. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by native insects. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a rough, textured surface. This species is adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat and is considered a keystone plant in its ecosystem."
