It features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact, spiral-like clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
