    "intro": "Pulicarioidea annamica, commonly known as the Annam pulicaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or near water bodies. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Pulicarioidea annamica is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
