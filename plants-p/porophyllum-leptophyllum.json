It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
