It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
