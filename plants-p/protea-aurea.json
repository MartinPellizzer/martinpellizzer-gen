    "intro": "Protea aurea, commonly known as the golden protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to yellowish flowers surrounded by a colorful, petal-like bract. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Protea aurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and vibrant appearance."
