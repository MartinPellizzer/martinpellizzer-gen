    "intro": "Pinus jezoensis f. microsperma, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a rare and unique variant of the Japanese white pine species. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded cones compared to the typical form. The plant is native to the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern Japan, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and limited distribution."
