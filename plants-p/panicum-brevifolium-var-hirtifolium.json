    "intro": "Panicum brevifolium var. hirtifolium, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
