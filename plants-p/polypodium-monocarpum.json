It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces a single, large, spore-bearing sorus on each frond. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Polypodium monocarpum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
