    "intro": "Pedicularis fletcheriana, commonly known as Fletcher's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling small lanterns. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
