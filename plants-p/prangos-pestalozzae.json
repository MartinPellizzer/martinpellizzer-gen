It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and contribute to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
