    "intro": "Pogonia fordii, commonly known as the Ford's pink. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant features a single, slender stem that produces a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Pogonia fordii is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
