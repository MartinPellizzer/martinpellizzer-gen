It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive yellowish or reddish hue. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Phyllanthus virosus has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
