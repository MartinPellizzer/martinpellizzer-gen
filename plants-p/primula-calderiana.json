    "intro": "Primula calderiana, commonly known as the Calderian primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Primula calderiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
