    "intro": "Pedicularis tricolor var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display red, yellow, and orange hues in a single bloom. The plant belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in rocky and moist environments, often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
