    "intro": "Peristylus gramineus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of other plants, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Peristylus gramineus is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats."
