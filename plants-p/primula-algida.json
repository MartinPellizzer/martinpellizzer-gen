    "intro": "Primula algida, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture in harsh environments. Primula algida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
