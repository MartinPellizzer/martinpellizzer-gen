    "intro": "Persica nana, commonly known as the dwarf peach tree, is a compact variety of the peach plant (Prunus persica). It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of only 1 to 3 meters, making it suitable for small gardens or container growing. The plant produces small, sweet fruits similar to regular peaches, with a thin skin and juicy, flavorful flesh. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Persica nana is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible yield."
