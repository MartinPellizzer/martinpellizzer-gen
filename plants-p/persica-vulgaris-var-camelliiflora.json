    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. camelliiflora, commonly known as the camellia-flowered peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure. It features large, showy flowers that resemble those of the camellia plant, with deep pink to red petals and a prominent yellow center. The plant is native to China and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. While it shares the fruit-bearing traits of the common peach, it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit."
