    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. parryana, commonly known as the Parry's ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and distinctive, flaky, reddish-bark that peels in longitudinal strips. The leaves are long, needle-like, and typically grow in clusters of two, with a bluish-green hue. It produces cones that are often larger and more robust than those of the typical ponderosa pine. This variant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
