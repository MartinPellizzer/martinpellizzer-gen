It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive wing-like structures on its seed heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets. Pentatrichia alata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
