    "intro": "Polypodium decurrens var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, evergreen fronds. The fronds are typically lance-shaped, with a broad, shield-like base, and are covered in small, rounded pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
