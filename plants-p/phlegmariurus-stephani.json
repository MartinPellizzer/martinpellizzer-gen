    "intro": "Phlegmariurus stephani, commonly known as the Stephens' haircap moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct, haircap-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Phlegmariurus stephani is characterized by its ability to retain moisture and thrive in humid, temperate climates."
