    "intro": "Pleurothallis cedrinorum, commonly known as the Cedrin's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees rather than in the ground. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
