    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis var. swartzianum, commonly known as the Swartz's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, featuring a distinctive shield-like appearance. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
