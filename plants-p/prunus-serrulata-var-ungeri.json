It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its historical significance in traditional Japanese horticulture adds to its cultural value."
