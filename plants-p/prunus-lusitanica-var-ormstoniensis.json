    "intro": "Prunus lusitanica var. ormstoniensis, commonly known as the Ormston cherry, is a rare and ancient variety of cherry native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional landscapes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
