    "intro": "Pseudomacodes cominsii, commonly known as the Comins' orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pseudomacodes cominsii is considered endangered in its natural range."
