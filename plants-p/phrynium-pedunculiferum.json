    "intro": "Phrynium pedunculiferum, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or swamp arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on tall, leafless stems. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used for their starchy content. Phrynium pedunculiferum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
