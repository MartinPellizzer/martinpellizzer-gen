    "intro": "Peteniodendron belizense, commonly known as the Belize mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the lowland rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces small, red fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous aril. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
