    "intro": "Pilea divaricata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea divaricata is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
