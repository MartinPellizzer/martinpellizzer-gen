    "intro": "Pitcairnia \u00d7 wittei, commonly known as the hybrid pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is a hybrid between Pitcairnia falcata and Pitcairnia leucantha, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. It produces showy, red or orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
