It features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by dry, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
