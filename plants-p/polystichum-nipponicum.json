    "intro": "Polystichum nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum nipponicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
