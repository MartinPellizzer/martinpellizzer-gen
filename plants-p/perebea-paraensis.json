    "intro": "Perebea paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide protection against intense sunlight and humidity. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Its unique morphology makes it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
