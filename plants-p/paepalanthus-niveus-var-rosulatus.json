    "intro": "Paepalanthus niveus var. rosulatus, commonly known as the white-flowered pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or cushion-like shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
