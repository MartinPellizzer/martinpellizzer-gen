    "intro": "Pteris asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in fine, rough-textured scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often clustered and help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
