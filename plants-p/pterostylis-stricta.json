    "intro": "Pterostylis stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hammer orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, club-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination by attracting wasps. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually green or brown, with a single, elongated spur that contains nectar. Pterostylis stricta is a rare and protected species, often found in rainforest environments."
