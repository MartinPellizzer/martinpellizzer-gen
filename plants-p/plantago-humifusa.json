    "intro": "Plantago humifusa, commonly known as the creeping plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike that rises above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
