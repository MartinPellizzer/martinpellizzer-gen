    "intro": "Pitcairnia aequatorialis var. bogneri, commonly known as the Bogner's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
