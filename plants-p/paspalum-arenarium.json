    "intro": "Paspalum arenarium, commonly known as sand paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought and saline conditions. Paspalum arenarium is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
