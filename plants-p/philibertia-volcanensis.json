    "intro": "Philibertia volcanensis, commonly known as the volcanic philibertia, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Philibertia volcanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude and nutrient-poor habitats."
