    "intro": "Phalaenopsis cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces elegant, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Phalaenopsis cochlearis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
