    "intro": "Panicum pallens var. majus, commonly known as the giant panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to white inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush, which are highly visible during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
