    "intro": "Poissonia heterantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its root system is specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Poissonia heterantha is often protected in its natural habitat."
