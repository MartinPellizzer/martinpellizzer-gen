    "intro": "Panicum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are usually green to brown in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
