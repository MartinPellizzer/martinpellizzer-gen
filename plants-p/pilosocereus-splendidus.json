    "intro": "Pilosocereus splendidus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a globular shape, often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. The cactus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens."
