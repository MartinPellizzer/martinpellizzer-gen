    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces wind-pollinated flowers. Pseudoroegneria cretacea is notable for its historical significance, as its fossils are among the earliest known grasses."
