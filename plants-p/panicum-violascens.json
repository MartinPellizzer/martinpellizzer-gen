    "intro": "Panicum violascens, commonly known as violet panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive violet-colored inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Panicum violascens is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
