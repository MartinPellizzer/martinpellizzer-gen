    "intro": "Populus arembergica, commonly known as the Arendell poplar, is a rare and lesser-known species of poplar native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
