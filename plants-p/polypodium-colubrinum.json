    "intro": "Polypodium colubrinum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a light green to dark green color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium colubrinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
