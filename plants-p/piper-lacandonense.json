    "intro": "Piper lacandonense, commonly known as the Lacandon pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a relatively obscure species within its native range."
