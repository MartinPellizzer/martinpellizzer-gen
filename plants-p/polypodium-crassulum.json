    "intro": "Polypodium crassulum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium crassulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
