    "intro": "Polygala serpillifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
