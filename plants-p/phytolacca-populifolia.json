    "intro": "Phytolacca populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf physicnut, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost maple-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots and leaves contain compounds such as phytolaccatoxin, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
