It features hairy, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. It typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. Pilosella echioides subsp. echioides thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
