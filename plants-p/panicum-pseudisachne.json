    "intro": "Panicum pseudisachne, commonly known as false bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, beige to brown flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Panicum pseudisachne is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
