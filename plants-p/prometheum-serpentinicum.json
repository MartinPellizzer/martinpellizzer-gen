    "intro": "Prometheum serpentinicum, commonly known as the Flame Serpent Plant, is a rare and striking species native to the volcanic regions of the southern Andes. It is characterized by its vivid orange and red foliage, which resembles the fiery hues of a serpent's scale. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight and well-draining conditions. Its unique appearance has made it a subject of fascination among botanists and horticulturalists. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
