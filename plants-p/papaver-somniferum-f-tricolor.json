    "intro": "Papaver somniferum f. tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color opium poppy, is a cultivated variant of the opium poppy characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers. The plant features showy, three-color petals that typically display red, orange, and yellow hues, making it a popular ornamental species. It grows as an annual herb with a stout, branching stem and palmately lobed leaves. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of capsule fruits containing the latex-rich seeds. This variety is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for opium production."
