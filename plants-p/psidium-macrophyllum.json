It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a shallow root system. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
