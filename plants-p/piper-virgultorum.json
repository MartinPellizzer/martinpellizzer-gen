    "intro": "Piper virgultorum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but often have a spicy taste due to the presence of piperine. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
