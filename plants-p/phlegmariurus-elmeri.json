    "intro": "Phlegmariurus elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has whorled leaves that form dense clusters, and its sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
