    "intro": "Phleum laeve, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, flat leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Smooth brome is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and rapid growth. It is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings for livestock grazing."
