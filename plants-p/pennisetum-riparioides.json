    "intro": "Pennisetum riparioides, commonly known as river grass or river millet, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and lakeshores, and is adapted to moist or wet environments. Its flowering spikes are usually pink or purple, adding ornamental value to gardens. Pennisetum riparioides is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in riparian zones."
