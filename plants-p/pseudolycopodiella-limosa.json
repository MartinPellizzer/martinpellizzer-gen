    "intro": "Pseudolycopodiella limosa, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
