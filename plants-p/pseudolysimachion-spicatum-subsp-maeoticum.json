    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion spicatum subsp. maeoticum, commonly known as the Crimean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Black Sea region. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in spikes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
