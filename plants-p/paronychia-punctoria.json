It is a small, succulent shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clustered, yellowish flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Paronychia punctoria is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
