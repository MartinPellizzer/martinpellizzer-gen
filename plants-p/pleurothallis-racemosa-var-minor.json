It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. The plant has short, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is prized for its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation. This variety is often grown in hanging baskets or mounted on bark to mimic its natural habitat."
