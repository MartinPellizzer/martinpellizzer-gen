    "intro": "Paeonia whitleyi, commonly known as the Whitley peony, is a rare and native species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, single or double flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a sought-after addition to native gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and role in supporting local ecosystems."
