    "intro": "Paspalum langei, commonly known as the longleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum langei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
