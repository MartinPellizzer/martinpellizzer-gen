    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. pitensis, commonly known as the Piton potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the island of Piton in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
