It is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown spikelets that are often mistaken for weeds in agricultural fields. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a competitive weed in cultivated areas."
