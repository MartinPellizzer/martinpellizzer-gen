    "intro": "Pentas decora var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular pentas, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
