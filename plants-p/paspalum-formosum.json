    "intro": "Paspalum formosum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its wetland surroundings. Paspalum formosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
