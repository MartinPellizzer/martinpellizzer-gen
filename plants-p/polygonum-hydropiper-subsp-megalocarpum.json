    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper subsp. megalocarpum, commonly known as giant water pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, peppery-tasting seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist soils and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
