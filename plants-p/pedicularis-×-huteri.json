    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 huteri, commonly known as the hybrid monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling orchids in appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
