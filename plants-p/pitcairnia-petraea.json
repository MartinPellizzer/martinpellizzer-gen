    "intro": "Pitcairnia petraea, commonly known as the rock pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
