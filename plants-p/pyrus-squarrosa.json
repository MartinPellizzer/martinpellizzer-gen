    "intro": "Pyrus squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-barked trunk and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits that are typically pear-shaped. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Pyrus squarrosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
