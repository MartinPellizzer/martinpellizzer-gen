It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and flat, often covered in a fine layer of hairs, and its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems."
