    "intro": "Prunus brachystachya, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has smooth, reddish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Prunus brachystachya is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
