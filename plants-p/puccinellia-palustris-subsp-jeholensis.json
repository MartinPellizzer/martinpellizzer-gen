    "intro": "Puccinellia palustris subsp. jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland habitats and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
