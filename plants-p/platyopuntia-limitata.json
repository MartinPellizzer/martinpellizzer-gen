    "intro": "Platyopuntia limitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
