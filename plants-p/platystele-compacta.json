    "intro": "Platystele compacta, commonly known as the compact star orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers with a unique coloration, often in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
