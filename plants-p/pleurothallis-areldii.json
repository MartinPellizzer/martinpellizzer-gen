    "intro": "Pleurothallis areldii, commonly known as the Areld's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette, allowing it to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Pleurothallis areldii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relative ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
