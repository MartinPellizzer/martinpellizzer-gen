    "intro": "Pedicularis pectinata subsp. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the twin-lobed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a pinnatifid (bipinnate) appearance, contributing to its specific subspecies name. This species is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
