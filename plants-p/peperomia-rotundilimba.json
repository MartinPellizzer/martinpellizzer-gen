    "intro": "Peperomia rotundilimba, commonly known as the rounded-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, though they are not showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia rotundilimba is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
