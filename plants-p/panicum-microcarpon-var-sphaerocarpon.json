    "intro": "Panicum microcarpon var. sphaerocarpon, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a compact, herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, spherical spikelets that give it a distinctive, clustered appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats in gardens and natural landscapes."
