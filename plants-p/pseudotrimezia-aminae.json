    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia aminae, commonly known as the Amin's pseudotrimezia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a dense, spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pseudotrimezia aminae is considered a vulnerable species."
