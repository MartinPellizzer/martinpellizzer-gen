It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. This plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its floating fronds. The species is noted for its adaptability to a variety of aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
