    "intro": "Polygala intricata, commonly known as the intricate milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala intricata is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
