    "intro": "Pollinia hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are specialized structures that contain the orchid's pollen in compact masses. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Pollinia hendersonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
