    "intro": "Phebalium elatum, commonly known as the silky hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Phebalium elatum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
