    "intro": "Prunus mohikana, commonly known as the Mohikana cherry, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible, red drupes that are similar in appearance to cherries but are typically smaller. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
