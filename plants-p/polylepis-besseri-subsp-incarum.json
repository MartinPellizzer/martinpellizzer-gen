    "intro": "Polylepis besseri subsp. incarum, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dense, silver-white bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, followed by dry, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
