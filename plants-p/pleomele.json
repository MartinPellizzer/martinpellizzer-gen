These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their tall, slender stems and strap-like leaves. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Pleomele species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in warm climates. They are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
