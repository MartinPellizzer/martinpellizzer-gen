It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color, resembling black pepper.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
