It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
