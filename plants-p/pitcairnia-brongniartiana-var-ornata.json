    "intro": "Pitcairnia brongniartiana var. ornata, commonly known as the ornate pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rosette-shaped leaves are stiff and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
