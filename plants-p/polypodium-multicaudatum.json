    "intro": "Polypodium multicaudatum, commonly known as the multi-tailed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium multicaudatum is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
