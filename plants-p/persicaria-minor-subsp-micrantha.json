It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm, featuring slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
