    "intro": "Pyrola asarifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, hairy stems. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing visual interest in shaded woodland environments. The leaves and flowers contain aromatic compounds, contributing to its characteristic wintergreen scent."
