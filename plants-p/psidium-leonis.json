    "intro": "Psidium leonis, commonly known as the lion's psidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. These berries are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit."
