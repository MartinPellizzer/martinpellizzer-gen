    "intro": "Pegaeophyton nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal peacock fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the tail of a peacock, with intricate, feather-like divisions. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pegaeophyton nepalense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
