    "intro": "Pseudosabicea becquetii, commonly known as the Cape mountain bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
