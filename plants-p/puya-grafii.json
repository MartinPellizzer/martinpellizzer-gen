    "intro": "Puya grafii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Puya grafii produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in late summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
