    "intro": "Phelypaea mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the edges of ponds and wetlands. Its small, white flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Phelypaea mauritanica plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
