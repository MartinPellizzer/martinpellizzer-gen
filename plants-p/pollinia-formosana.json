    "intro": "Pollinia formosana, commonly known as the Formosa orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
