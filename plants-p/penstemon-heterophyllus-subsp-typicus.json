It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
