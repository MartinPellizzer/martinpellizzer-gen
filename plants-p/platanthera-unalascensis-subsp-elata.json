    "intro": "Platanthera unalascensis subsp. elata, commonly known as the tall lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pale yellow to greenish coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a short, erect stem with a single, large, hooded flower. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
