    "intro": "Pictetia spinifolia var. desvauxii, commonly known as the Desert Honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-water gardening practices."
