    "intro": "Penstemon newberryi subsp. berryi, commonly known as Newberry's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
