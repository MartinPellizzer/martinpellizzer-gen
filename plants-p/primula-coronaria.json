    "intro": "Primula coronaria, commonly known as the crown imperial, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of tall, erect stems. The flowers are typically a deep red or orange color, with a distinctive crown-like appearance formed by the overlapping petals. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
