    "intro": "Pavonia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months. Its botanical characteristics include showy, five-petaled flowers and a fibrous root system. Pavonia angustifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
