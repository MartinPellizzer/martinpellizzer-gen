    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis brongniartii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, spore-producing sporangia located on the underside. Pyrenoglyphis brongniartii plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
