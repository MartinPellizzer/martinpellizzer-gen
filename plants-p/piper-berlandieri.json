    "intro": "Piper berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed, fleshy berries, which are edible and have a peppery taste. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and culinary contexts."
