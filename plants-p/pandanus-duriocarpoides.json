It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, fragrant flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. The fruit, a woody capsule, contains several seeds and is an important resource for local communities."
