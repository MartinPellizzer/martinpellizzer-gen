    "intro": "Pelecinus biserrula, commonly known as the two-toothed pelecinid, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Pelecidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and distinctive, elongated antennae. The beetle is primarily found in the eastern United States, where it inhabits a variety of forested environments. Its life cycle includes a larval stage that feeds on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an insect rather than a botanical organism."
