    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum var. densobrunneum, commonly known as black millet, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored inflorescence, which gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
