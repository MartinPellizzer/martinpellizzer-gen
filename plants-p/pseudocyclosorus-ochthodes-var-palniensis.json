    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus ochthodes var. palniensis, commonly known as the Palni hill fern, is a rare variant of the genus Pseudocyclosorus. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30\u201350 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the mountainous regions of southern India. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists studying fern diversity."
