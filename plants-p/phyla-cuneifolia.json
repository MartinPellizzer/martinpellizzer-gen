    "intro": "Phyla cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique leaf structure and reproductive features make it a notable species in botanical studies."
