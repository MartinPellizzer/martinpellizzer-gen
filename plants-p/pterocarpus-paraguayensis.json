    "intro": "Pterocarpus paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized timber species. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable in some regions."
