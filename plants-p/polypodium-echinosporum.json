    "intro": "Polypodium echinosporum, commonly known as the spiny-sporangium fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spiny, protective cupule. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
