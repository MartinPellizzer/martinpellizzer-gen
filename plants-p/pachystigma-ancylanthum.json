It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
