It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small pineapples. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to coastal and humid environments, and it is often used in traditional landscaping and horticulture."
