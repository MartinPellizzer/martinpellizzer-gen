    "intro": "Pyrus saracenia, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are palmately lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Pyrus saracenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in Japanese horticulture."
