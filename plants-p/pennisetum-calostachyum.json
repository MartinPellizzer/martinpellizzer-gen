    "intro": "Pennisetum calostachyum, commonly known as the red fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that produce dense clusters of feathery, crimson plumes during the late summer and autumn seasons. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 feet, making it a popular choice for landscape design and garden borders. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Pennisetum calostachyum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established."
