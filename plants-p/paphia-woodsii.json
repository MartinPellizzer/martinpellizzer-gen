    "intro": "Paphia woodsii, commonly known as the Yellow Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a unique slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollinator trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in the understory of dense rainforests. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators like bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paphia woodsii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
