    "intro": "Pernettya nubigena, commonly known as the clouded cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. Pernettya nubigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
