    "intro": "Philadelphus oreganus, commonly known as the Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland and streamside habitats. Philadelphus oreganus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
