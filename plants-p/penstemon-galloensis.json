    "intro": "Penstemon galloensis, commonly known as the Galloen penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon galloensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
