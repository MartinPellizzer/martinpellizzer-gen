    "intro": "Pouteria exstaminodia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, edible fruits resembling a cross between a grape and a melon. Its botanical significance lies in its unique fruit composition, which contains high levels of antioxidants, vitamins, and lipids, making it a valuable resource in both ecological and commercial contexts."
