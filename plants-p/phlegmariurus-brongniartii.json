It is characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that are covered with a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green with a reddish hue at the tips, giving it a striking appearance. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a decorative epiphyte."
