    "intro": "Polyscias sessiliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often deeply veined. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polyscias sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
