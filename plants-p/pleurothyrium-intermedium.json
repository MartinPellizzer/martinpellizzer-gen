It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed."
