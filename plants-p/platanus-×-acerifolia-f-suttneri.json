    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia f. suttneri, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platanus occidentalis and Platanus racemosa. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban conditions, making it a popular choice for street planting. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring. The fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
