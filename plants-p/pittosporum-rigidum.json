    "intro": "Pittosporum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Pittosporum rigidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
