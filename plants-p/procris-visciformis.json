    "intro": "Procris visciformis, commonly known as the sticky leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that exude a viscous substance. This secretion, which gives the plant its common name, serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and pests. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a distinctive veining pattern that aids in water retention. Procris visciformis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat."
