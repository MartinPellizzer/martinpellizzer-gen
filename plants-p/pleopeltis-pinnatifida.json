    "intro": "Pleopeltis pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are often fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
