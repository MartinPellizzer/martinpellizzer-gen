    "intro": "Palicourea obesiflora, commonly known as the fat-flowered palicourea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
