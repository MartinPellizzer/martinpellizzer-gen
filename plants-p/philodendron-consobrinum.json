    "intro": "Philodendron consobrinum, commonly known as the silver star philodendron, is a climbing tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a striking silvery-white margin that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardens and hanging baskets."
