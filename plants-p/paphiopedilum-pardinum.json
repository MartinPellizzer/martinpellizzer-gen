It is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that is often yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are relatively small and have a distinctive, pouch-like structure that aids in pollination. Paphiopedilum pardinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
