    "intro": "Pappostipa chrysophylla f. modica, commonly known as the Modica form of the golden feather grass, is a horticultural variant of a grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, golden-green foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescence that adds a soft, ornamental quality to gardens. This form is typically shorter and more compact than the species, making it suitable for borders or as a ground cover.
