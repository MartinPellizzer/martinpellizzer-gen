    "intro": "Proclesia scabriuscula, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments."
