    "intro": "Platanthera fimbriata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. This orchid is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is often associated with other moisture-loving flora."
