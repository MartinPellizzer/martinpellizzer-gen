    "intro": "Pinguicula australandina, commonly known as the Southern Cape butterwort, is a small, carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Pinguicula australandina is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
