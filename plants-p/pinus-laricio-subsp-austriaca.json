    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian stone pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to the Alps and Carpathian regions. It is a tall, slow-growing conifer with a straight trunk and a broad, irregular crown. The needles are long, dark green, and arranged in bundles of five, while the cones are woody and often remain on the tree for many years. The bark is thick, fissured, and scaly, providing protection against fire and pests. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in timber and resin production."
