It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in preventing desertification. Due to its adaptation to extreme conditions, it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem of its native habitat."
