    "intro": "Pogonia viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its striking greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, peaty soils and requires a moist, shaded environment to flourish. Its reproductive cycle depends on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological complexity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species, emphasizing the need for conservation efforts."
