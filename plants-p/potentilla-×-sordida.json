    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 sordida, commonly known as the sordid cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are dark green and slightly hairy, with a serrated edge that contributes to its distinctive appearance. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
