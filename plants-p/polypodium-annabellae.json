    "intro": "Polypodium annabellae, commonly known as the Annabell's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in the understory of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium annabellae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
