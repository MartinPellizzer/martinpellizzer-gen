    "intro": "Paullinia trigonia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
