    "intro": "Preslianthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panama ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, smooth fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in lowland tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
