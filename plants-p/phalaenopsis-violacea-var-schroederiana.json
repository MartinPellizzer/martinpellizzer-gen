It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
