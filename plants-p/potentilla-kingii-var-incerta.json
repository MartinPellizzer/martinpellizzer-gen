    "intro": "Potentilla kingii var. incerta, commonly known as the King's potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
