    "intro": "Platykeleba insignis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically pale pink or white with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Platykeleba insignis is considered an endangered species."
