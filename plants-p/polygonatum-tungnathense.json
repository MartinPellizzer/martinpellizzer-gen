    "intro": "Polygonatum tungnathense, commonly known as the Tungnath snake root, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas, particularly found in Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its medicinal properties have been explored in traditional Ayurvedic practices, though its use remains limited due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements. The species is also noted for its resilience in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
