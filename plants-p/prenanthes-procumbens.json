    "intro": "Prenanthes procumbens, commonly known as creeping water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and compound leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
