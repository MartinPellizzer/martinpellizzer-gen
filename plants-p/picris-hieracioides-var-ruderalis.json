    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. ruderalis, commonly known as rough hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and serrated, hairy leaves. This variant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
