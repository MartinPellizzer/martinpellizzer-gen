    "intro": "Poa sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Himalayan regions, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Poa sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
