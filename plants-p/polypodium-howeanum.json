    "intro": "Polypodium howeanum, commonly known as the Howean huperzia, is a fern-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium howeanum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
