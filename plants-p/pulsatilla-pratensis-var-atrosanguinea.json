    "intro": "Pulsatilla pratensis var. atrosanguinea, commonly known as the dark blood pasqueflower, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is often found in calcareous grasslands and meadows. Its unique coloration and habitat preferences make it a notable subject in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
