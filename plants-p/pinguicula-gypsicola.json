    "intro": "Pinguicula gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the gypsum soils of southern Spain. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Pinguicula gypsicola is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a unique example of carnivory in specialized ecosystems."
