    "intro": "Prasophyllum crebriflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in heathland and forested areas, particularly in southeastern Australia. The plant features a basal rosette of linear leaves and produces a tall, flowering stem with numerous small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation reserves."
