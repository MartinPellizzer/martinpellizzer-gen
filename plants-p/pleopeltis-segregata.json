    "intro": "Pleopeltis segregata, commonly known as the segmented rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
