    "intro": "Phlox subulata f. candidula, commonly known as the silver mound phlox, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens across the United States."
