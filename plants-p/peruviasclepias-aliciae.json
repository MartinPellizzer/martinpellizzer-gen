    "intro": "Peruviasclepias aliciae, commonly known as the Alicia's peruviasclepias, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, dry pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
