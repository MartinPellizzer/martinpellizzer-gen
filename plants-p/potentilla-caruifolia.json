    "intro": "Potentilla caruifolia, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its native habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
