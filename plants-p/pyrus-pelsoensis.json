    "intro": "Pyrus pelsoensis, commonly known as the Pelsoan pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers in spring. Its fruit, resembling a pear, is typically small and edible, though not widely cultivated. The botanical features of Pyrus pelsoensis make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
