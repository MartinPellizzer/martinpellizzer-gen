    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian frost plant, is a hardy, low-growing perennial that thrives in alpine and subarctic environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically in shades of white or pale blue, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. This variety is particularly valued in horticulture for its resilience and ability to add texture to rock gardens and alpine displays."
