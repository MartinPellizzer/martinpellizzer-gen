    "intro": "Piloblephis rigida, commonly known as the rigid piloblephis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Piloblephis rigida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
