    "intro": "Phrynium simplex, commonly known as the white elephant plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shady environments. Phrynium simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design for its lush foliage."
