    "intro": "Polypodium decumanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, walls, and in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
