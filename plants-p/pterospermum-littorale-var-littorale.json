It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically alternate and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody pods containing oval seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in coastal ecology and plant adaptation studies."
