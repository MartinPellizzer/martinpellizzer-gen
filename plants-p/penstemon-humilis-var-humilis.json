    "intro": "Penstemon humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the low penstemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features erect, branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its flowers are tubular and usually blue to purple in color, with five lobes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
