    "intro": "Polypodium gradatum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in moist forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium gradatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in a variety of tropical climates."
