    "intro": "Poa haemii, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Poa haemii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
