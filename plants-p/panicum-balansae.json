    "intro": "Panicum balansae, commonly known as Balansa bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Balansa bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
