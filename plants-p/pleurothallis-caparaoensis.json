    "intro": "Pleurothallis caparaoensis, commonly known as the Caparao orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitat."
