    "intro": "Pilea parietaria var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a variant of the common houseleek that thrives in alpine environments. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It grows in rocky crevices and walls, often forming dense mats. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes in mountainous regions."
