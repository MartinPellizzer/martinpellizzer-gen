    "intro": "Pterostylis carinata, commonly known as the ridged greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flower is a striking greenish-yellow with a hood-like structure, and it produces a single, elongated spike of small, fragrant flowers. Pterostylis carinata is pollinated by insects, particularly flies, due to its strong floral scent."
