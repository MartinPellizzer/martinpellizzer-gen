    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 mollifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its cascading form. Pelargonium \u00d7 mollifolium thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
