    "intro": "Pisum arvense var. variegatum, commonly known as the variable field pea, is a variant of the field pea that exhibits distinctive variegation in its foliage. This plant is a herbaceous annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a pale or white-veined pattern that sets it apart from other pea species. The flowers are small and usually pale blue or white, and the plant produces pods containing several edible seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both garden use and traditional agricultural purposes."
