    "intro": "Pleomele mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 pleomele, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to the unique geological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
