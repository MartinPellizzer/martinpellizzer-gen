    "intro": "Ptelea toxicodendron, commonly known as poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it has a strong, aromatic odor. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its leaves, which can cause skin irritation and other adverse reactions in humans."
