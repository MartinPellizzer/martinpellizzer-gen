    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis, commonly known as the trailing potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Potentilla peduncularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
