    "intro": "Polypodium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often split into two equal parts, giving it the \"dichotomous\" appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium dichotomum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
