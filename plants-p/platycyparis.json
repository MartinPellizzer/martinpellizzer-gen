    "intro": "Platycyparis, commonly known as the cedar of Lebanon, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the cypress family, Cupressaceae. These trees are characterized by their scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structures, which are typical of conifers. They are native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. Platycyparis species, such as Platycyparis libani, are known for their aromatic wood and historical significance in ancient architecture and religious practices. Their botanical features make them valuable in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
