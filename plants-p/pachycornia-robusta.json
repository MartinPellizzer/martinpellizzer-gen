    "intro": "Pachycornia robusta, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled trunk and dark, deeply fissured bark that provides protection against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces pale yellow or white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Pachycornia robusta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
