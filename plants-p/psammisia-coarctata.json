    "intro": "Psammisia coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Psammisia coarctata is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
