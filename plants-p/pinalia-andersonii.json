    "intro": "Pinalia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant produces small, edible seeds that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinalia andersonii is considered a conservation concern."
