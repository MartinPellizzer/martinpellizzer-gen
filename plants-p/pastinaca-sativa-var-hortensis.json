    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa var. hortensis, commonly known as the common parsnip, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its long, slender, white to yellowish root that is typically harvested in the second year of growth. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that form a rosette during its first year. Its flowering stems are hollow and ridged, producing small, yellowish-green umbels of flowers. The parsnip is cultivated for its edible root, which is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, nutty flavor when mature."
