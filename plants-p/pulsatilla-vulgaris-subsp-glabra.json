    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris subsp. glabra, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a unique, spherical seed head that resembles a small, fluffy ball, which is typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, fuzzy texture that helps distinguish it from other similar species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
