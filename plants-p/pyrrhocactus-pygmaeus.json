    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus pygmaeus, commonly known as the miniature flame cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular stem covered in short, spiny bristles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of bright orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance needs, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
