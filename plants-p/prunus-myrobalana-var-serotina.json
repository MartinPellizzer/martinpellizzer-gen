    "intro": "Prunus myrobalana var. serotina, commonly known as the late-fruiting almond, is a variety of the almond tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that ripen later in the season compared to other almond varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible, sweet kernels. The tree is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and prefers well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and for the nutritional content of its seeds."
