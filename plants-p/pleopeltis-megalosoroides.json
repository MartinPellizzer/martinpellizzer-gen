    "intro": "Pleopeltis megalosoroides, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns and contribute to its propagation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
