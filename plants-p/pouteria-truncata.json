It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree is renowned for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazilian nuts. Its fruit is a large, capsule-like structure that splits open to release the seeds. The plant has significant ecological and economic importance in South America."
