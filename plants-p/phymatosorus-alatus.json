    "intro": "Phymatosorus alatus, commonly known as the spreading cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often curved fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
