    "intro": "Paspalum microstachyum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy, salty soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in coastal dunes and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
