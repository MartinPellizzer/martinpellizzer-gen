    "intro": "Psychanthus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly psychanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and less commonly cultivated species."
