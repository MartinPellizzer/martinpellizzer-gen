    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 hollandiae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is a hybrid between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera chlorophaea, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, slender flower spikes. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. This orchid thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
