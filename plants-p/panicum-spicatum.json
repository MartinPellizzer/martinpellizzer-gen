    "intro": "Panicum spicatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like clusters of small, bluish-green leaves. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun. It plays an important role in ecological restoration and is a valuable source of biomass for renewable energy."
