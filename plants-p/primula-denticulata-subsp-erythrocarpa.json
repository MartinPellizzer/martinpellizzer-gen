    "intro": "Primula denticulata subsp. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features hairy, basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its distinctive red berries, which persist into autumn, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to cool, moist environments."
