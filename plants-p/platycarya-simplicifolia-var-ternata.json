    "intro": "Platycarya simplicifolia var. ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are divided into three lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscape design for hedging and borders."
