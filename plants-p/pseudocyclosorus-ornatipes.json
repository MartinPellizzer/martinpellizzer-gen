It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with intricate, ornate patterns on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pseudocyclosorus ornatipes is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
