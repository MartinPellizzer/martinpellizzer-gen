    "intro": "Pulicaria argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
