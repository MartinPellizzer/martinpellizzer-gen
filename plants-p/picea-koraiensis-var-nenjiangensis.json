    "intro": "Picea koraiensis var. nenjiangensis, commonly known as the Nenjiang fir, is a rare coniferous species native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
