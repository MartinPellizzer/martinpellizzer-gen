    "intro": "Podocarpus lenticularis, commonly known as the lenticular podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, lens-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is known for its slow growth and longevity. It typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
