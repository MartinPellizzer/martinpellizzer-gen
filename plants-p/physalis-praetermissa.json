    "intro": "Physalis praetermissa, commonly known as the common groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that enclose a cluster of orange-red berries, which are edible when mature. These berries are often used in cooking for their tart flavor, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Physalis praetermissa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens and wildflower habitats."
