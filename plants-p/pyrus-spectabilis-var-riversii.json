    "intro": "Pyrus spectabilis var. riversii, commonly known as the River Pear, is a deciduous tree native to the riverine habitats of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, slender form and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces edible, sweet, yellowish fruit that ripens in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along waterways."
