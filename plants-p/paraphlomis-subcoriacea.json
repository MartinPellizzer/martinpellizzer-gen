It features slender, often hairy stems that are covered in a rough, coriaceous texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Paraphlomis subcoriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
