    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia polyneura, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are typical of the Rutaceae family. The plant produces multiple fruits, each containing several seeds, which aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments."
