It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves with a distinctive white net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
