    "intro": "Pyrus froebelii, commonly known as the Froebel's pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and attractive, finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive."
