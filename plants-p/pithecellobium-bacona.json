It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to grow in coastal and upland habitats, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to carambola, though less commonly consumed. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
