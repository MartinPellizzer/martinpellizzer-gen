    "intro": "Phoradendron steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, elliptical leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
