    "intro": "Phoradendron calyculatum var. filipes, commonly known as the curly-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Spondias*. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of the forest canopy. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments."
