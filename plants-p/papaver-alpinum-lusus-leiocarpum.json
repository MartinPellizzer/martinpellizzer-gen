    "intro": "Papaver alpinum lusus leiocarpum, commonly known as the Alpine white poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its capsule-like fruit contains numerous small, black seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
