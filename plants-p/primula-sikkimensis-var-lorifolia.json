    "intro": "Primula sikkimensis var. lorifolia, commonly known as the Sikkim primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It is characterized by its vibrant purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
