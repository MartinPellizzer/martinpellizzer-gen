    "intro": "Polypodium vacciniifolium var. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved polypody, is a fern species native to parts of East Asia. It features delicate, lanceolate to heart-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. This variant is distinguished by its slightly heart-shaped leaves, which set it apart from the typical lanceolate leaves of the main species."
