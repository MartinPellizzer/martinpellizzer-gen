    "intro": "Petrocosmea martini var. leiandra, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which contrast with its greenish-yellow lip, making it visually distinctive. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
