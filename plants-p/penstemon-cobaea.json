    "intro": "Penstemon cobaea, commonly known as the showy penstemon, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant produces clusters of flowers at the top of its stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Penstemon cobaea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
