    "intro": "Phymatopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or calcareous soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Their fronds are usually compact and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Phymatopteris species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging landscapes."
