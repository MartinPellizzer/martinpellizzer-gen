    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum convar. contractum, commonly known as proso millet, is an annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often cultivated for its high nutritional value and adaptability to various climates. Proso millet is also valued for its role in sustainable agriculture due to its low water requirements and ability to grow in poor soils."
