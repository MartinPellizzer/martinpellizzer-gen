    "intro": "Petastoma platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf petastoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features broad, flat leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in compact clusters, and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
