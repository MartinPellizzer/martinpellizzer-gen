It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of local ecosystems in its native range."
