    "intro": "Paraphyadanthe lophocarpa, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the cool, moist environments of the Andes. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-white blossoms that are often clustered together. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
