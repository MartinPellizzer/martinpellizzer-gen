    "intro": "Plagiostigma pineum, commonly known as the red pine or eastern red pine, is a coniferous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. The tree produces long, slender cones that typically mature in the second year, and its needles are dark green, often with two white lines on the underside. Plagiostigma pineum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. It is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
