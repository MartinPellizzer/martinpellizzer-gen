    "intro": "Pteris nemoralis var. major, commonly known as the large wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a leathery texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
