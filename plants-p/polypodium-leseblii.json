It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Polypodium leseblii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
