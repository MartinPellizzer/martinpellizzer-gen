    "intro": "Phaedranassa dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and its distinctive, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on its host for physical support. Its flowers are typically small and lack the showy petals seen in many other orchids, instead featuring intricate, thread-like structures. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Phaedranassa dubia is considered a critically endangered species."
