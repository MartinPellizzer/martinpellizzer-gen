    "intro": "Poa perouinii, commonly known as the Peruvian grass, is a species of grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. Poa perouinii is often found in rocky or alpine areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
