    "intro": "Panope stoechadifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Panope stoechadifolia is well adapted to maritime climates and is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
