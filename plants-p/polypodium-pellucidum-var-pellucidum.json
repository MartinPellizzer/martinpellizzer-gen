    "intro": "Polypodium pellucidum var. pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy, translucent cuticle, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
