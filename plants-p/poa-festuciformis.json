    "intro": "Poa festuciformis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Poa festuciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
