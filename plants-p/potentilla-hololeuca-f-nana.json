    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca f. nana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments with cold temperatures and strong winds. Its foliage consists of oval, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against the cold. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine beds."
