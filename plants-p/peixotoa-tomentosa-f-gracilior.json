    "intro": "Peixotoa tomentosa f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender woolly peixotoa, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and compact growth habit. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to specific regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant typically features small, elliptical leaves covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
