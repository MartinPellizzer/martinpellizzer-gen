    "intro": "Pycnocomus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, spiky flower heads that resemble small cups, often with bright yellow or orange petals. They are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in mountainous and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the stems are upright and branched. Pycnocomus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
