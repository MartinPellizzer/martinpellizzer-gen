    "intro": "Poecilochroma quitensis, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Poecilochroma quitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
