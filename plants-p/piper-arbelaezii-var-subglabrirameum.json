    "intro": "Piper arbelaezii var. subglabrirameum, commonly known as the glossy sarsaparilla, is a member of the Piperaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant features dark green, glossy foliage with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that give it a lush appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, followed by small, round berries that mature to a bright red color. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother texture compared to other varieties of Piper arbelaezii."
