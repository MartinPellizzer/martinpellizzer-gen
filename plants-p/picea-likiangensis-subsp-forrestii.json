    "intro": "Picea likiangensis subsp. forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
