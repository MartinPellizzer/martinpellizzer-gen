    "intro": "Putoria brevifolia var. dyris, commonly known as the Dyris variant of the short-leaved putoria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which are borne on short pedicels. Its botanical classification places it within the family Acanthaceae, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
