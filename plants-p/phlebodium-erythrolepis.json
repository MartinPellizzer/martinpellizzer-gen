    "intro": "Phlebodium erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-veined staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a thick, leathery frond with prominent, reddish veins that give it its distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and covered in a fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
