    "intro": "Panicum involutum, commonly known as curly panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, curly leaf blades, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its adaptability makes it both a common weed and a potential ornamental plant in certain landscapes."
