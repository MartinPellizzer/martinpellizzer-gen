    "intro": "Pedicularis scolopax, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
