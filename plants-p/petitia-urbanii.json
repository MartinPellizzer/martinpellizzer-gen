    "intro": "Petitia urbanii, commonly known as the urban petitia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific microhabitats in urban environments. It thrives in areas with high pollution tolerance, often growing through cracks in concrete or along neglected sidewalks. The plant features small, pale green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are tiny and clustered, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Petitia urbanii is considered a valuable indicator of urban biodiversity."
