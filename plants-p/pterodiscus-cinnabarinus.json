    "intro": "Pterodiscus cinnabarinus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark red to reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
