    "intro": "Polypodium aculeatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, holly-like leaves. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with serrated margins that give it a rugged appearance. Polypodium aculeatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
