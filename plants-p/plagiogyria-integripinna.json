    "intro": "Plagiogyria integripinna, commonly known as the smooth-leafed marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically unlobed and have a smooth margin. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are usually only a few inches long, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Plagiogyria integripinna plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
