    "intro": "Platanthera muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
