    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. brachypteron, commonly known as the short-crested rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical form, with a distinctive, short-stemmed structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, and the fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and size. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
