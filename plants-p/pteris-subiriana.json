    "intro": "Pteris subiriana, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate. Pteris subiriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic gardening."
