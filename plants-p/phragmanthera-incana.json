    "intro": "Phragmanthera incana, commonly known as the woolly phragmanthera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in humid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable moisture levels."
