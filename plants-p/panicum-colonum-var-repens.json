    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. repens, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u725b\u7b4b\u8349, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. It is often found in wet or disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and coastal areas."
