    "intro": "Pteris pectinata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Pteris pectinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
