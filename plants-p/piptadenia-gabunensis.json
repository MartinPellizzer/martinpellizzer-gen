    "intro": "Piptadenia gabunensis, commonly known as the African locust bean tree, is a leguminous plant native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional foods and beverages. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agroforestry systems. Additionally, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
