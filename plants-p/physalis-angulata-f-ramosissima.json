    "intro": "Physalis angulata f. ramosissima, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry or wild tomato, is a variant of the common groundcherry. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas, characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, inflated fruits that turn from green to orange-red as they mature. Its foliage is typically lobed and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
