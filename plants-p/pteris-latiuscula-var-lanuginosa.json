    "intro": "Pteris latiuscula var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive features. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The hairy texture of its fronds is an adaptation that may help retain moisture and protect against desiccation."
