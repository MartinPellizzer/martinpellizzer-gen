    "intro": "Passiflora foetida var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forests or along riverbanks. Its unique floral structure and strong, sometimes unpleasant odor make it a distinctive and ecologically important species."
