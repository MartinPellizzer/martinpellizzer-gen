    "intro": "Ptilagrostiella kingii, commonly known as the King's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range. Ptilagrostiella kingii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental grass-like appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
