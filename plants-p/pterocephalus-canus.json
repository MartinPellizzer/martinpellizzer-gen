    "intro": "Pterocephalus canus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fibrous stems were historically used by indigenous peoples for making textiles and ropes."
