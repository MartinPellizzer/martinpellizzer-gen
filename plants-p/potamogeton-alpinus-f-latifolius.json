    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus f. latifolius, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters, typical of the Potamogeton genus. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in lakes and ponds in temperate and alpine regions. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and stable aquatic ecosystems."
