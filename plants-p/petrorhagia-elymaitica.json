    "intro": "Petrorhagia elymaitica, commonly known as the Elymaitic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Petrorhagia elymaitica is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
