    "intro": "Panicum javanum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm wide. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
