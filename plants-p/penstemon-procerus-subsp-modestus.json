    "intro": "Penstemon procerus subsp. modestus, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
