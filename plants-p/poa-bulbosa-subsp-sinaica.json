    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. It blooms with pale blue to purple flowers, typically in spring or early summer. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
