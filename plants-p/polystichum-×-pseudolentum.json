    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 pseudolentum, commonly known as the hybrid ebony fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum aculeatum and Polystichum milleflorum. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically arching and have a leathery texture. The plant produces a dense, compact rosette of fertile fronds that are often dark green with a slightly curled appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
