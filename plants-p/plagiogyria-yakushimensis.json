    "intro": "Plagiogyria yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushiman Islands lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in the subtropical regions of Japan. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
