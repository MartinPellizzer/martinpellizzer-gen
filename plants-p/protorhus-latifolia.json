    "intro": "Protorhus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf protorhus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Protorhus latifolia produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
