    "intro": "Pandanus globulosus, commonly known as the globular pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, musky flavor. Pandanus globulosus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline in humid climates."
