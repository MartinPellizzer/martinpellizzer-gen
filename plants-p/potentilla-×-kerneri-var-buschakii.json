    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 kerneri var. buschakii, commonly known as the Buschakii cineraria, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that reflects light and gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form compact, mounded growth."
