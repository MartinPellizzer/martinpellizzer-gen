    "intro": "Potentilla horrida, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Potentilla horrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
