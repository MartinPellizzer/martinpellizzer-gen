    "intro": "Pedicularis nordmanniana, commonly known as the northern lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitats."
