    "intro": "Pulicaria dysenterica var. microcephala, commonly known as small-headed wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller flower heads compared to other varieties of Pulicaria."
