    "intro": "Phyllanthus foetidus, commonly known as stinkwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard, angular seeds. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
