    "intro": "Pentapanax henryi var. larium, commonly known as the Yunnan pentapanax, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
