    "intro": "Polypodium splendidum var. macropterum, commonly known as the broad-winged sword fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a distinctive, bipinnate structure. The fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
