    "intro": "Pilocereus arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to thrive in low-water environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate care."
