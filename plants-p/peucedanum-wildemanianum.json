    "intro": "Peucedanum wildemanianum, commonly known as wildeman's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided leaves and small white to greenish flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
