It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, colorful flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Parakeelya is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation and decorative arrangements."
