    "intro": "Polystichum maximowiczii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a dense, upright frond structure with a distinctive shield-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green with a leathery texture and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
