    "intro": "Phylica elliptica, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Phylica elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
