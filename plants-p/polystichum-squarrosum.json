    "intro": "Polystichum squarrosum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum squarrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
