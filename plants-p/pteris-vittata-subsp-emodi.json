    "intro": "Pteris vittata subsp. emodi, commonly known as the Emo fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or clay soils. This fern is also noted for its ability to accumulate arsenic, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
