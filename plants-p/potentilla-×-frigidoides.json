It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and a high tolerance for frost. Potentilla \u00d7 frigidoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in areas with harsh weather conditions."
