It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
