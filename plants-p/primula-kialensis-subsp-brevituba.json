    "intro": "Primula kialensis subsp. brevituba, commonly known as the short-tubed primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understoreys and rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its tubular corolla is notably short, giving it its subspecies name, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
