    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, riverbanks, and roadside embankments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues, and it produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in spike-like clusters. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a habitat for various invertebrates."
