It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in coastal areas with a temperate climate. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
