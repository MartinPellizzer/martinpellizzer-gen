    "intro": "Panicum montanum, commonly known as mountain panicum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from green to reddish-brown, depending on the stage of development. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. Panicum montanum is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
