It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow disk flowers that are typically surrounded by ray florets. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, this species thrives in rocky and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its morphology reflects adaptations to harsh environments, with a compact growth form and a high tolerance for cold and drought."
