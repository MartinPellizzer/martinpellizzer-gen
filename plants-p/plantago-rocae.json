    "intro": "Plantago rocae, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in early summer. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective capsule, which helps them survive in harsh environments. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
