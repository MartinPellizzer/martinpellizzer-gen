    "intro": "Pilea dendrophila var. subintegra, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to China. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are slightly curled at the edges, giving it a unique, shingle-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for those seeking a decorative, easy-to-care-for specimen."
