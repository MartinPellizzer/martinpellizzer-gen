It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
