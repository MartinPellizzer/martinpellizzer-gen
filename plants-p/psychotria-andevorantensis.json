It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found growing in cloud forests and on rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
