    "intro": "Pyrus horizontalis, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-sour fruits that are often used in traditional Japanese cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Pyrus horizontalis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
