    "intro": "Prioria tenuicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited prioria, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a slender, woody pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests."
