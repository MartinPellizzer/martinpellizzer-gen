    "intro": "Pinus halepensis subsp. pityusa, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat, often from a fire, which aids in seed dispersal. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
