    "intro": "Plagiocheilus soliviformis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white and green. Its inflorescence is a raceme of small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Plagiocheilus soliviformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
