    "intro": "Polystichum rachichlaena, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, lush appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
