    "intro": "Polypodium atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome serving as the primary storage organ and means of vegetative propagation. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of tropical forests."
