    "intro": "Panicum gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
