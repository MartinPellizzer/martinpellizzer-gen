    "intro": "Peliostomum leucorrhizum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the white root water plant, is a flowering aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots hang below, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in spherical inflorescences, which appear in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
