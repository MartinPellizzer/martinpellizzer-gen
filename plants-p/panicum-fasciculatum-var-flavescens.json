It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale yellow to golden florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
