    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
