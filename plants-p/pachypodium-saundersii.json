It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has sparse, upright leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the rainy season. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
