    "intro": "Pritchardia minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pritchardia minor is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
