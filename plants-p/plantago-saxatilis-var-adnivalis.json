    "intro": "Plantago saxatilis var. adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in elongated inflorescences, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or alpine habitats, it plays an important ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
