    "intro": "Populus mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed capsules that release tiny seeds in the wind. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing remarkable drought tolerance. Its bark is often smooth and gray, while its branches spread out in a broad, rounded shape. Populus mauritanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
