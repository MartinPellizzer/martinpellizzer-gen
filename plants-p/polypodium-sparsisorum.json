    "intro": "Polypodium sparsisorum, commonly known as the sparse-veined wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with sparse and irregularly spaced veins. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Polypodium sparsisorum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
