    "intro": "Phyllodoce nipponica var. tsugifolia, commonly known as the Japanese mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its cool, moist habitats. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters and often greenish or reddish in color, while its berries are small and dark, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This species is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, woodland environments."
