    "intro": "Penstemon albifluvis, commonly known as the white river penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the genus Penstemon, which includes over 250 species of flowering plants, many of which are adapted to arid environments. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to white in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.
