    "intro": "Parasicyos maculatus, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by purple or black berries. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are woody and often branched. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
