    "intro": "Pothos leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruit pothos, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and small, white, fleshy fruits that mature in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers indirect sunlight. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and spread along surfaces, making it an attractive houseplant. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil."
