It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
