    "intro": "Pentacocca, commonly known as the five-finger plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of five ray florets arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are native to regions in southern Africa and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Pentacocca species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique floral structure."
