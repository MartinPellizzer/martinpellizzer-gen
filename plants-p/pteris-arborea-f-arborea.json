    "intro": "Pteris arborea f. arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered with a dense mass of fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, green appearance in gardens."
