It features distinctive red stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize wet areas make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
