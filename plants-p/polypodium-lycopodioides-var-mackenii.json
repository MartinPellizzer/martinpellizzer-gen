    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. mackenii, commonly known as the Mackenii sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, dark green, leathery frond that is divided into pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
