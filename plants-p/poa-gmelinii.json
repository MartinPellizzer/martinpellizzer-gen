    "intro": "Poa gmelinii, commonly known as the Gmelin's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow ecosystems. Poa gmelinii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
