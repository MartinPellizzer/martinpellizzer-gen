It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces woody, elongated capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its rapid growth and lightweight, durable wood. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread aggressively."
