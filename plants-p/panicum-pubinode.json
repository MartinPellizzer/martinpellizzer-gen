    "intro": "Panicum pubinode, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and full sun conditions. Panicum pubinode is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides."
