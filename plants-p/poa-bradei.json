    "intro": "Poa bradei, commonly known as Brade's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or coastal sites. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually erect and hairy. Poa bradei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
