It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
