    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba var. guestphalicum, commonly known as bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a single, unbranched stem that rises from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention. The species is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
