    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare, commonly known as the round-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded or ovate, often with a hairy texture, and it produces elongated, cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
