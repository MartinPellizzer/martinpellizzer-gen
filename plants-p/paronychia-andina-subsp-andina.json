    "intro": "Paronychia andina subsp. andina, commonly known as Andean nail grass, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
