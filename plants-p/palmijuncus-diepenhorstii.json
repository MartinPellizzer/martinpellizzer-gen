It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact, tree-like structure with a single trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important subject for study in ecological and conservation research."
