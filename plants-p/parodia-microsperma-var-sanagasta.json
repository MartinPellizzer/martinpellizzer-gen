    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. sanagasta, commonly known as the Sanagasta Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
