It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
