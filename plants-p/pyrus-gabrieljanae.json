    "intro": "Pyrus gabrieljanae, commonly known as Gabriel's pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus gabrieljanae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
