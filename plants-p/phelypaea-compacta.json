    "intro": "Phelypaea compacta, commonly known as the compact water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phelypaea compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
