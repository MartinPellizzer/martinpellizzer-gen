    "intro": "Pyrus oviformis, commonly known as the oval-shaped pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to common pears but are less widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Pyrus oviformis is also valued for its potential in horticultural breeding programs."
