    "intro": "Physalidium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth leaf balloon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and spread. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a inflated, balloon-like structure that contains several seeds. The leaves are entire, meaning they have no lobes or teeth, and are typically smooth to the touch."
