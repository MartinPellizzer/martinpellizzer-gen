    "intro": "Phytolacca heptandra, commonly known as the seven-lobed physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ridged stems and alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans alike."
