    "intro": "Potentilla pedata subsp. anisosepala, commonly known as the variable cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its variable sepals, which can be unequal in size, contributing to its common name."
