    "intro": "Pyrus communis glabra, commonly known as the European white pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 inches long. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The glabra variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy or fuzzy texture on its leaves and stems."
