    "intro": "Polypodium merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue. Polypodium merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
