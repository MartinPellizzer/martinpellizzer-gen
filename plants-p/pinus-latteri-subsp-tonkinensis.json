    "intro": "Pinus latteri subsp. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
