    "intro": "Psoralea argophylla var. decumbens, commonly known as the spreading psoralea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, pinnately lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
