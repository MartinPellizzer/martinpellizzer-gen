    "intro": "Paullinia scarlatina, commonly known as the red soursop or Brazilian soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but has a distinct red outer skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the medicinal properties of its leaves and fruit. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
