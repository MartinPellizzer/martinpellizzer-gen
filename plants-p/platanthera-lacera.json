    "intro": "Platanthera lacera, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a dense spike of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and pine forests. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base of the stem. Platanthera lacera is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
