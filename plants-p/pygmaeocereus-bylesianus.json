    "intro": "Pygmaeocereus bylesianus, commonly known as the Bylesian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
