    "intro": "Pteris tripinnatifida, commonly known as the three-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or humid gardens."
