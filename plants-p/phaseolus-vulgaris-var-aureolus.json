    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. aureolus, commonly known as the golden bean, is a variant of the common bean that exhibits striking golden-yellow foliage. This plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm climates, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are broad and deeply lobed, often with a velvety texture, while the flowers are typically white or pale pink. It produces small, edible pods that can be harvested before they fully mature, adding both aesthetic and culinary value. Due to its unique coloration and growth habits, it is often cultivated for its visual appeal rather than its yield."
