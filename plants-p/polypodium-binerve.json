    "intro": "Polypodium binerve, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows. Polypodium binerve thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
