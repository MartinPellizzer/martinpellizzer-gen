    "intro": "Polystichum moluccense, commonly known as the Moluccan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Moluccas and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a dense, leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum moluccense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
