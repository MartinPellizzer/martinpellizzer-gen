    "intro": "Plectranthus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered plectranthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is complemented by its mild fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
