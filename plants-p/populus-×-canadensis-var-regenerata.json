    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. regenerata, commonly known as the trembling aspen or white poplar, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a fast-growing tree that often forms dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance in riparian zones. Its ability to regenerate from roots makes it resilient to disturbances."
