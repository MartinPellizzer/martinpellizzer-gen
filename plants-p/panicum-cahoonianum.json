    "intro": "Panicum cahoonianum, commonly known as Cahoon's switchgrass, is a native perennial grass species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Cahoon's switchgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
