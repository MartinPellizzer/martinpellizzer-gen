    "intro": "Peperomia velutina var. lanceolata, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, velvety, dark green leaves with a slight sheen, giving it a lush, textured appearance. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are not particularly showy. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
