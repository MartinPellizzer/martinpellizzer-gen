    "intro": "Psychotria kikwitensis, commonly known as Kikwit's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Due to its habitat in remote and often threatened areas, it is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
