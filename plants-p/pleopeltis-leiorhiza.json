    "intro": "Pleopeltis leiorhiza, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
