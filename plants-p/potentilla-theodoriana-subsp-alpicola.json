    "intro": "Potentilla theodoriana subsp. alpicola, commonly known as alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, wiry stems and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
