    "intro": "Pedicularis kanei, commonly known as the Kamei's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis kanei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
