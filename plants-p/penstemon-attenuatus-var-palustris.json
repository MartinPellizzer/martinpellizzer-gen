    "intro": "Penstemon attenuatus var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich environments. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
