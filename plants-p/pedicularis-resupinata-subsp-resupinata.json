    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata subsp. resupinata, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of ovate, hairy leaves and produces striking violet to purple spurred flowers on erect, leafy stems. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows and mountain tarns. The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species in alpine flora."
