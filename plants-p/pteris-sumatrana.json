    "intro": "Pteris sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread effectively. Pteris sumatrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
