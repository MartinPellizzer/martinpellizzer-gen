    "intro": "Philibertia hastata, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Philibertia hastata is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
