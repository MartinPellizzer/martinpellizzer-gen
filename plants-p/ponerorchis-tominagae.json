    "intro": "Ponerorchis tominagae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved flower spikes that bear small, delicate flowers with a distinctive greenish-white hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ponerorchis tominagae is considered a conservation concern."
