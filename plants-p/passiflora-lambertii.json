    "intro": "Passiflora lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by local communities. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often twining around supporting structures. Passiflora lambertii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological and culinary significance."
