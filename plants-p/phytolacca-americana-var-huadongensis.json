    "intro": "Phytolacca americana var. huadongensis, commonly known as the eastern pokeweed, is a variant of the pokeweed species native to eastern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
