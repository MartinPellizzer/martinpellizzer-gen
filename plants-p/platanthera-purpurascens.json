    "intro": "Platanthera purpurascens, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called leaves that perform photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
