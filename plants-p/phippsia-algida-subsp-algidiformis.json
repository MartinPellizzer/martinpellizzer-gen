    "intro": "Phippsia algida subsp. algidiformis, commonly known as the cold-forming phippsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-like inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is adapted to cold climates, with a compact growth habit and dark green, hairy leaves. Its flowers are small, white to pale green, and typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its restricted habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
