The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, cylindrical cones. It is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and can withstand harsh weather conditions. Picea alpestris plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
