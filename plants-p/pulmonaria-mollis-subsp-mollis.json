It features basal rosettes of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
