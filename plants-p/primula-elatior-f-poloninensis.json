    "intro": "Primula elatior f. poloninensis, commonly known as the Polish primrose, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant has thick, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
