    "intro": "Pogonospermum serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering pogonospermum, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming late in the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
