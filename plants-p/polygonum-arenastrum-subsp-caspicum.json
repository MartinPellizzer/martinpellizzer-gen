It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
