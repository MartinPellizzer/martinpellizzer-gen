The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and graceful form, making it a popular choice for gardens. The species is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
