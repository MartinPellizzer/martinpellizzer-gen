    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. planifolia, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
