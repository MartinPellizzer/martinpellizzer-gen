    "intro": "Periclymenum sempervirens var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the woodlands of eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
