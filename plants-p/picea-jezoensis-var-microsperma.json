    "intro": "Picea jezoensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the Japanese white pine, is a rare variant of the Japanese white pine native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The cones are small and usually hang in clusters, with seeds that are notably smaller than those of the standard Picea jezoensis. This variety is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
