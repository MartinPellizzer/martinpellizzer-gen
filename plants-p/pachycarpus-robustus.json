    "intro": "Pachycarpus robustus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and woody stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark contains a milky sap, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. Pachycarpus robustus is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
