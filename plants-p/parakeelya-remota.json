    "intro": "Parakeelya remota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, elongated shape. Its roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Parakeelya remota is considered a conservation concern."
