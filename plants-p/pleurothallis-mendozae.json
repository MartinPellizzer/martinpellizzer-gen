    "intro": "Pleurothallis mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
