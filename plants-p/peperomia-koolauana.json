    "intro": "Peperomia koolauana, commonly known as the Koolauan peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a deep green color and sometimes a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
