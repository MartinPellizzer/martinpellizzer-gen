    "intro": "Pleuropterantha undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf pleuropterantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
