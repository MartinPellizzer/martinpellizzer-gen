    "intro": "Pilosella brachycoma subsp. acrochaetia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing habit with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its characteristic \"mouse-ear\" look. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
