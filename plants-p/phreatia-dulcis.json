    "intro": "Phreatia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet phreatia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. The plant has strap-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked. Phreatia dulcis is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them."
