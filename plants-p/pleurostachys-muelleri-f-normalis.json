The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences that are usually brightly colored, often in shades of red or orange. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against herbivores. This species is native to Mexico and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
