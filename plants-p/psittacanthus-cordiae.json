    "intro": "Psittacanthus cordiae, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cascading fronds that give it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Psittacanthus cordiae thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
