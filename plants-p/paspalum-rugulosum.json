    "intro": "Paspalum rugulosum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, grasslands, and along roadsides. Paspalum rugulosum is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in some regions for forage and erosion control."
