    "intro": "Pterotheca vahlii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Pterotheca vahlii is often found in dunes and rocky outcrops, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
