    "intro": "Potentilla plurijuga, commonly known as the two-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically has slender, arching stems with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and serrated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact growth form."
