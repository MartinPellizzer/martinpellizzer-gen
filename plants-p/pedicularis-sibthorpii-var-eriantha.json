    "intro": "Pedicularis sibthorpii var. eriantha, commonly known as the woolly lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important subject in botanical studies of alpine ecosystems."
