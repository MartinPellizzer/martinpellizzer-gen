It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces numerous small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
