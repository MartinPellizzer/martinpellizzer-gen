    "intro": "Polypodium portoricense, commonly known as the Puerto Rican holly fern, is a species of polypody found in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly in Puerto Rico. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are leathery and have a distinctive, serrated appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The botanical characteristics of Polypodium portoricense make it an important component of the local flora and ecosystem."
