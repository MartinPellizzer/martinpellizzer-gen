It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in montane forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are often white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
