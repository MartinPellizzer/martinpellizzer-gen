It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fleshy, often hairy stems. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip petal, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
