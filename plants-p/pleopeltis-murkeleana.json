    "intro": "Pleopeltis murkeleana, commonly known as the Murkelean rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces while absorbing moisture from the air. The fronds are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated margin, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
