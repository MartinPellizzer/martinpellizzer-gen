    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow bean, is a variant of the common bean plant characterized by its yellow pod and seed color. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and pubescent. The yellow beans are often used in culinary applications, similar to other common beans, though their vibrant color makes them a popular choice for ornamental purposes as well."
