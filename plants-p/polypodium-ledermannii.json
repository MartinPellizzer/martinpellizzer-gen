    "intro": "Polypodium ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
