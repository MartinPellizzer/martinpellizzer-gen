    "intro": "Pitcairnia hammelii, commonly known as the hammel's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red and orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia hammelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
