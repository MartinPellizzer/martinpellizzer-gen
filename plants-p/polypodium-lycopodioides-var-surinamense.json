    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam huperzia, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are often covered in small, rounded spore cases. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophytic structures are clustered along the stems, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variant is noted for its morphological distinctiveness compared to the typical form of Polypodium lycopodioides."
