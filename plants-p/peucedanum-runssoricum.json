It is native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm, with slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring, followed by small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.
