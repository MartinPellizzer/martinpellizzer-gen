It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are typically rounded and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of a short stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.
