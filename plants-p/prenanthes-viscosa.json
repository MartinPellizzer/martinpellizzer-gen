    "intro": "Prenanthes viscosa, commonly known as sticky beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The flowers are small and greenish-white, and the plant produces berries that are edible but have a mild, nutty flavor."
