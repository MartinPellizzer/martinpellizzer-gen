    "intro": "Ponerorchis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a rare and endangered terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
