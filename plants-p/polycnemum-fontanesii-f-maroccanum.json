    "intro": "Polycnemum fontanesii f. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan polycnemum, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
