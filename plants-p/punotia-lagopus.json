    "intro": "Punotia lagopus, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically grayish-green, covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Punotia lagopus is adapted to survive in harsh, alpine conditions with low temperatures and limited soil nutrients."
