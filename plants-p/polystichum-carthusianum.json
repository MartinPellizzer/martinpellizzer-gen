    "intro": "Polystichum carthusianum, commonly known as the Carthusian brake, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, pointed pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, textured foliage."
