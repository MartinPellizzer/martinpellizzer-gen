    "intro": "Polygonum scabrum, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stout, often reddish stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and rough to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white or pale yellow, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. Polygonum scabrum is known for its fibrous roots and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
