    "intro": "Pternandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough pternandra, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing it with some resistance to drought and herbivory. Pternandra coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
