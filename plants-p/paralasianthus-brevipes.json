    "intro": "Paralasianthus brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed flame tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
