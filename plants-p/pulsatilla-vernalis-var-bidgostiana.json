    "intro": "Pulsatilla vernalis var. bidgostiana, commonly known as the Bidgostan pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often hairy flowers and basal leaves. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a cluster of pale yellow to pinkish flowers with a distinctive, woolly center. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky soils, preferring cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
