    "intro": "Picris spinifera subsp. algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbi thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves with a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in scrubland and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
