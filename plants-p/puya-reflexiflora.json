It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its vibrant red and orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Puya reflexiflora is a long-lived perennial, often surviving for decades, and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
