    "intro": "Polygala glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens."
