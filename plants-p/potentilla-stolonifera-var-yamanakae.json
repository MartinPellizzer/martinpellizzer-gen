It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a soft, velvety texture. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
