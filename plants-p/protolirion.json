    "intro": "Protolirion, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Protolirion thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
