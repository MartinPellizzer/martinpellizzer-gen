It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences that produce bright red or orange flowers, which are particularly attractive to birds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.

This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
