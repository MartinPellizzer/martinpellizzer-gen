    "intro": "Piscidia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban passionflower, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the passionfruit plant, with five petals and a distinctive crown of stamens. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Piscidia cubensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
