    "intro": "Protea micans subsp. suffruticosa, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant characterized by its large, showy inflorescences. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers that attract pollinators like birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and climate change."
