    "intro": "Polypodium quasipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's rhizome is usually short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment."
