    "intro": "Polypodium thomassetii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium thomassetii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
