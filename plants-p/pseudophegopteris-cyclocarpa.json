    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarp fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The cyclocarp fern is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
