    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. elongata, commonly known as the snow willow or white cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
