It is a warm-season grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields."
