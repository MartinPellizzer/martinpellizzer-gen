    "intro": "Polystichum subquinquefidum, commonly known as the five-fid wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into five pairs of segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum subquinquefidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
