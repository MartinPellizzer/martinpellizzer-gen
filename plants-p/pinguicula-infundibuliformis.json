    "intro": "Pinguicula infundibuliformis, commonly known as the hooded butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
