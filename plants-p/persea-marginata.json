It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often marginally serrated. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible when fully ripe. Its fruit is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Persea marginata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
