    "intro": "Pyrus communis subsp. salviifolia, commonly known as the leafy pear, is a subspecies of the common pear native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance compared to other pear species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible fruits that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and genetic research. The subspecies is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
