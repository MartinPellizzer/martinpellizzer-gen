It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage composed of thick, leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its tolerance of salt and drought. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in Mediterranean climates."
