    "intro": "Ponthieva vasqueziae, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's ponthieva, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common adaptation in humid, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponthieva vasqueziae is considered a species of conservation concern."
