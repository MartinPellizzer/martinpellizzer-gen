It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and thick, oval-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. Its botanical features make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
