    "intro": "Postia lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky polypore, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is a wood-decaying basidiomycete that typically grows on dead or decaying hardwoods, especially in temperate forests. The fruiting bodies of Postia lanuginosa are small, sponge-like, and often have a velvety or fuzzy surface, which gives the species its common name. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow pores and a generally soft, spongy texture. This fungus plays an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
