    "intro": "Poinsettia cyathophora var. graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy poinsettia, is a unique variant of the poinsettia species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and reduced bracts compared to the more common poinsettia varieties. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. While less commercially popular than other poinsettia varieties, it is appreciated for its ornamental value and unique foliage structure."
