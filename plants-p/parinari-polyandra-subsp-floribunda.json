It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in dense inflorescences. The plant produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local communities."
