    "intro": "Primula smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
