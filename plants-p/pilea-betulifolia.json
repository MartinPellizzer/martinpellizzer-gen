    "intro": "Pilea betulifolia, commonly known as the shamrock plant, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble the shape of a shamrock. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by rounded, spiky berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea betulifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
