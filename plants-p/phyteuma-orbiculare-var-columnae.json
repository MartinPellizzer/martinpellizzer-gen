    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar phyteuma, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright, cylindrical stems that give it its distinctive \"columnar\" appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact growth habit."
