    "intro": "Plutarchia monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually a vibrant purple or violet, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plutarchia monantha is considered a conservation concern."
