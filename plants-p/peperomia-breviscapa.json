    "intro": "Peperomia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for container growing and space-limited environments."
