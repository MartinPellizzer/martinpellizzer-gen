It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
