    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries. It is valued for its dense foliage and ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant."
