It features slender, slightly hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
