    "intro": "Pleomele gabonica, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native environment."
