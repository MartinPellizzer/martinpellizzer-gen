    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. incisa, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white to gray-green leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive notched or lobed appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its ornamental value is due to its striking foliage and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
