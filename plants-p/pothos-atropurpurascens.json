    "intro": "Pothos atropurpurascens, commonly known as the black nightshade pothos, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a striking purple underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular houseplant. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its foliage rather than its flowers or fruits."
