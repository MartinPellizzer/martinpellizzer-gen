    "intro": "Pyragma, commonly known as the candle plant, is a unique succulent that features a swollen, candle-like stem. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in hot, dry conditions. The plant's thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Pyragma is prized for its unusual appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
