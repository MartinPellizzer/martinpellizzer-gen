It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
