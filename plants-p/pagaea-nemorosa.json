    "intro": "Pagaea nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland star, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the woodlands of eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Pagaea nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
