    "intro": "Polystachya woosnamii var. nyungweensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe bamboo orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
