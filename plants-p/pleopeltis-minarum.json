    "intro": "Pleopeltis minarum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, compact growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pleopeltis minarum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
