    "intro": "Parduyna multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered parduyna, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
