    "intro": "Paederota humilis, commonly known as the humble chafer beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Scarabaeidae. It is characterized by its small, rounded body and a distinctively segmented abdomen. The beetle is typically found in moist, grassy habitats, where it feeds on decaying plant matter. Its larvae are also detritivores, contributing to the decomposition process in soil ecosystems. Due to its ecological role, it plays a part in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
