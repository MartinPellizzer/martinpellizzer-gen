    "intro": "Pitcairnia marnier-lapostollei, commonly known as the Marnier-Lapostolle pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
