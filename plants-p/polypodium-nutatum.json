    "intro": "Polypodium nutatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium nutatum is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant."
