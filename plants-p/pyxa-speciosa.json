    "intro": "Pyxa speciosa, commonly known as the showy pyxie, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Pyxa speciosa thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated."
