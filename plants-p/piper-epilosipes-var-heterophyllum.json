    "intro": "Piper epilosipes var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variant is notable for its morphological variation in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its taxonomic complexity."
