    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. litoralis, commonly known as sea potentilla, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and salty environments. It is a low-growing shrub with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Its hardy nature makes it an important species for stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
