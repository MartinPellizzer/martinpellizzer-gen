    "intro": "Petrocoptis pyrenaica subsp. pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the Pyrenean false bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, submerged leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as pools and streams. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
