    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sun-plant, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and wet meadows. Its roots contain specialized structures called mycorrhizae, which form symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake."
