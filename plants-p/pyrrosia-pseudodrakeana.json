    "intro": "Pyrrosia pseudodrakeana, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
