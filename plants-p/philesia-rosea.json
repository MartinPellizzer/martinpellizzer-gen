    "intro": "Philesia rosea, commonly known as the rose daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, rose-like flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in the garden."
