    "intro": "Pseudocaryophyllus hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's false caryophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
