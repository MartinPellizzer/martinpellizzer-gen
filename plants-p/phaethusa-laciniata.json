    "intro": "Phaethusa laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf phaethusa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
