    "intro": "Pinus dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh coastal conditions. Pinus dalmatica is adapted to saline environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline."
