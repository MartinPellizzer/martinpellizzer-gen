    "intro": "Potentilla leptopetala, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Potentilla leptopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
