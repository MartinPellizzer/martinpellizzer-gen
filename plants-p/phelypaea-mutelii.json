    "intro": "Phelypaea mutelii, commonly known as the Mutel's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It thrives in cold, clear streams and lakes, often in high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around its stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it is pollinated by insects. Phelypaea mutelii is considered an important indicator species for the health of freshwater ecosystems."
