    "intro": "Panax microphyllus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its root, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
