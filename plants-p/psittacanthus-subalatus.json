    "intro": "Psittacanthus subalatus, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branched fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying a golden hue on the underside. The golden staghorn fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
