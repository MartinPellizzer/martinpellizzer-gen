    "intro": "Pterostylis nichollsiana, commonly known as the Nicholls' hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that resembles a bird's beak, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and under dense vegetation. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a single, erect, spurred labellum. The orchid has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, inconspicuous leaves."
