    "intro": "Plantago maritima subvar. bracteata, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in sandy or salty soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
