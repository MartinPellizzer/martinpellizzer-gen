    "intro": "Phaca collina, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in shallow, brackish water and is often found in salt marshes and estuaries. Its leaves are ribbon-like and arranged in whorls, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow-green. Phaca collina plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
