    "intro": "Polypogon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a small, tufted grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed or wet soils. Polypogon pumilus is characterized by its low-growing habit and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
