    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 alpigena, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
