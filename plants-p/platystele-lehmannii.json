    "intro": "Platystele lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platystele lehmannii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
