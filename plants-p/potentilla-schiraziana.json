    "intro": "Potentilla schiraziana, commonly known as the Schiraz snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features slender, arching branches covered in finely serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
