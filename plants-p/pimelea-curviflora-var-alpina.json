    "intro": "Pimelea curviflora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, woody fruits known as follicles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, sunny environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
