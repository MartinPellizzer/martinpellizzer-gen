    "intro": "Pilosella flagellaris subsp. glatzensis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves that are often covered with a fine, silky down. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
