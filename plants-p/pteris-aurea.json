It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bright yellow or golden in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pteris aurea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental horticulture."
