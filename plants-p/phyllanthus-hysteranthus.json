    "intro": "Phyllanthus hysteranthus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered phyllanthus, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
