    "intro": "Psidium luridum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, edible fruits similar to those of the common guava. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in its native habitat."
