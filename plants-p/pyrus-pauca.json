    "intro": "Pyrus pauca, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn a striking red or orange in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. The tree is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, contributing to its ecological significance."
