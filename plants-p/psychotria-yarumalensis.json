    "intro": "Psychotria yarumalensis, commonly known as the Yarumal psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
