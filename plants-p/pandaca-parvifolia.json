    "intro": "Pandaca parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pandaca, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, Pandaca parvifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
