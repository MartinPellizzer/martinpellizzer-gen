    "intro": "Pentatrichia integra, commonly known as the common fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Pentatrichia integra is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
