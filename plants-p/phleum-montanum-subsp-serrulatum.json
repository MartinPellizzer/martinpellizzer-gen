    "intro": "Phleum montanum subsp. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, serrated leaf blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or degraded landscapes."
