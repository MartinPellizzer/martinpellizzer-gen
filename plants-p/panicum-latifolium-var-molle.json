    "intro": "Panicum latifolium var. molle, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, soft leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces fluffy, light green to golden seed heads that are often mistaken for moss due to their appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
