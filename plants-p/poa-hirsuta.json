    "intro": "Poa hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
