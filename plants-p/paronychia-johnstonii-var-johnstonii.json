    "intro": "Paronychia johnstonii var. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's paronychia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
