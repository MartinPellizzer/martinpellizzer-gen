It typically thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems covered in small, glandular hairs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
