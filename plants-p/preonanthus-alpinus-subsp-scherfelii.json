    "intro": "Preonanthus alpinus subsp. scherfelii, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
