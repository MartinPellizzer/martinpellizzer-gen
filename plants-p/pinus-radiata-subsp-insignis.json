    "intro": "Pinus radiata subsp. insignis, commonly known as the coastal radiata pine, is a subspecies native to the western coast of South Island, New Zealand. It is a tall, evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The tree produces cones that mature within 12 to 18 months, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh maritime conditions."
