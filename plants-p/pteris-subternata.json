    "intro": "Pteris subternata, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along stream edges. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
