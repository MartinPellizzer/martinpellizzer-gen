    "intro": "Plantago limarensis, commonly known as the Limari plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
