    "intro": "Pandanus gibberosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its roots and leaves are sometimes used in local medicine and for making thatch. This species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
