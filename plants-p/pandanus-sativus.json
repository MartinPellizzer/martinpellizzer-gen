    "intro": "Pandanus sativus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into woody, spiky fruits containing edible seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to coastal and sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in saline environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various species."
