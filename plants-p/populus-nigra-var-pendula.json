    "intro": "Populus nigra var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking deciduous tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like hair. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies. Its heart-shaped leaves are broad and dark green, turning yellow in the autumn. The tree produces catkins that release lightweight seeds, aiding in its propagation. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
