    "intro": "Passiflora tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its fruit is a yellow, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. Passiflora tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential sedative and calming properties."
