    "intro": "Penstemon procerus var. modestus, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that support its showy, tubular flowers. The flowers, typically pink to purple in color, bloom in late spring to early summer and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements contribute to its appeal among gardeners in arid regions."
