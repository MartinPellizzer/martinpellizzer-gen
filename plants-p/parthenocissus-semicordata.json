    "intro": "Parthenocissus semicordata, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its tendrils allow it to climb walls, trees, and other structures with ease. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used for covering trellises or as a ground cover."
