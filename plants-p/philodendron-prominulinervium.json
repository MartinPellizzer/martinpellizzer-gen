    "intro": "Philodendron prominulinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, visible veins that give it its scientific name. The plant has a robust stem that can climb using aerial roots, and its foliage is often a deep green with a glossy texture. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The broad-veined philodendron is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
