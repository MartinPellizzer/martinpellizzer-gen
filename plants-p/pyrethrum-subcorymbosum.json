    "intro": "Pyrethrum subcorymbosum, commonly known as the subcorymbous pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in seed dispersal. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pyrethrum subcorymbosum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
