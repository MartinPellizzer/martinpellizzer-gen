    "intro": "Panax elegans, commonly known as the elegant ginseng, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in ecological studies of endangered flora."
