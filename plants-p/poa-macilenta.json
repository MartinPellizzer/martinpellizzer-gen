    "intro": "Poa macilenta, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, upright blades and a tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Poa macilenta is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
