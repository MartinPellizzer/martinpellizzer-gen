It features rounded, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and attractive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, green fruit that turns red as it matures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea troyensis is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through stem cuttings or division."
