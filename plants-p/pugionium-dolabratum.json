    "intro": "Pugionium dolabratum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry climates."
