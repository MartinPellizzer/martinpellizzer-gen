    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it a shrub-like appearance despite being a conifer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green needles that are arranged in bundles of five, and its cones are typically reddish-brown and relatively small. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its slow growth and compact size."
