    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis f. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, thriving in crevices and on tree trunks. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with elongated pinnae that give it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
