It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various insect and bird species."
