    "intro": "Plutarchia dolos, commonly known as the deceitful orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet petals and a unique, intricate floral structure that resembles a miniature crown. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat. Botanists note that its pollination process is highly specialized, relying on a specific species of moth for reproduction."
