    "intro": "Pedicularis petrophila, commonly known as the rock pilchard, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pedicularis petrophila is considered a vulnerable species."
