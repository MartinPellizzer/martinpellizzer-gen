    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-season color."
