    "intro": "Pteris nana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small, compact fern native to Southeast Asia. It has fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or substrates. Pteris nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
