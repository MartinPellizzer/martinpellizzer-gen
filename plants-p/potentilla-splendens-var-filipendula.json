It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
