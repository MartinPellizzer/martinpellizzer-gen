    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis var. latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lush, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
