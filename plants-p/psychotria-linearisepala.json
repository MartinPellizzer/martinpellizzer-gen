It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in understory vegetation of rainforests. Psychotria linearisepala is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
