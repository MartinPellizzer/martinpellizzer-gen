    "intro": "Parapteroceras carnosum, commonly known as the fleshy-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitats. The fleshy leaves also serve as a food source for certain herbivores, contributing to its ecological significance."
