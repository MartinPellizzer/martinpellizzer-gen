    "intro": "Pisum frigidum, commonly known as the cold pea, is a rare and frost-tolerant legume native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted to survive in harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Pisum frigidum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
