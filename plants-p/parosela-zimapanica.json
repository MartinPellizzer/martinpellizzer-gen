    "intro": "Parosela zimapanica, commonly known as the Zimapanica parosela, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Parosela zimapanica is considered a vulnerable species."
