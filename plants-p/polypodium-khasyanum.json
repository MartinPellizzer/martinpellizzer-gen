    "intro": "Polypodium khasyanum, commonly known as the Khasi polypody, is a species of fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in anchoring the plant to rocky or soil substrates. Polypodium khasyanum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
