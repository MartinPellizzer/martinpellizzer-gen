    "intro": "Polypodium lampongense, commonly known as the Philippine cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its ability to grow on trees or rocky surfaces. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Polypodium lampongense is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
