    "intro": "Pouteria sussu, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or *pata de vaca*, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to chestnuts, with a thick, spiny husk enclosing a sweet, starchy pulp. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food for various wildlife species."
