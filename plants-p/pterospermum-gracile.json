    "intro": "Pterospermum gracile, commonly known as the slender pterospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, often climbing or shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
