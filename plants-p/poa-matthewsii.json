    "intro": "Poa matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Poa matthewsii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
