    "intro": "Poa chambersii, commonly known as the Chambers' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
