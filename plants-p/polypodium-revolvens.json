    "intro": "Polypodium revolvens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, curled appearance, especially when young. Polypodium revolvens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging rocky soils."
