    "intro": "Penducella cardiocheila, commonly known as the heartleaf penducella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
