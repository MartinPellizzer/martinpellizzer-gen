    "intro": "Picea abies var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce adapted to cold climates. It is a small evergreen conifer that typically grows in northern regions, including parts of Scandinavia and Siberia. The plant features needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard Norway spruce. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a characteristic species of boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
