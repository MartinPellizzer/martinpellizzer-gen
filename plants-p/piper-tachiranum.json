It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its small, elongated fruits are typically green when unripe and turn red upon maturity, containing a spicy, peppery flavor. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for research purposes."
