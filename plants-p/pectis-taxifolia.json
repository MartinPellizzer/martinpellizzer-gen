    "intro": "Pectis taxifolia, commonly known as the featherleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Pectis taxifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
