    "intro": "Pandanus duriocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiny fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The leaves and fruits of Pandanus duriocarpus have cultural and practical significance in the regions where it is found."
