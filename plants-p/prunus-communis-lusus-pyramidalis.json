    "intro": "Prunus communis lusus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cherry, is a cultivar of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its upright, conical growth habit, making it an attractive choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible red cherries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular pruning to maintain its pyramidal shape. This variety is relatively disease-resistant and suitable for smaller gardens or as a specimen tree."
