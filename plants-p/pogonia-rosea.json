    "intro": "Pogonia rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and its distinctive pinkish-white flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Pogonia rosea is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
