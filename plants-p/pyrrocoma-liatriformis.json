    "intro": "Pyrrocoma liatriformis, commonly known as the yellow mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental qualities in native plant gardens. Pyrrocoma liatriformis is also notable for its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a useful plant for erosion control in riparian areas."
