    "intro": "Pinus subpatula, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and soft, gray-green foliage. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, with a bluish-gray hue and a slight waxy coating. It produces cones that are initially green but turn brown as they mature. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
