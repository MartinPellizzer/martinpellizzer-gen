    "intro": "Psammogeton ranunculifolius, commonly known as the sandrocket, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions."
