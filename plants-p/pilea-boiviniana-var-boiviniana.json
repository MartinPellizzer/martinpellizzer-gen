    "intro": "Pilea boiviniana var. boiviniana, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to southern China. It features rosettes of heart-shaped, thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental foliage and ease of care, making it a popular houseplant."
