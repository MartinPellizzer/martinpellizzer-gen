    "intro": "Pterospermum acerifolium, commonly known as the maple-leaved pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with white petals that bloom in spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
