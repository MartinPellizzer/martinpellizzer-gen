    "intro": "Pterocarpus minimus, commonly known as the small pterocarp, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous traits and distinctive pod fruits. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and the bark is often deeply fissured. The wood of Pterocarpus minimus is valued for its density and color, though it is less commercially significant compared to other species in the genus."
