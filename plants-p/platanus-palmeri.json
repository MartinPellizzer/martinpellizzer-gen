    "intro": "Platanus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release hairy seeds."
