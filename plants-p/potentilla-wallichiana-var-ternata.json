It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
