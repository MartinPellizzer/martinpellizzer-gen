It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon modestus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer season."
