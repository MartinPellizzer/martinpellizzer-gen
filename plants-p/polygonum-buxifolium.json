    "intro": "Polygonum buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaf knotweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking, bright red to orange flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a leathery texture, resembling the foliage of boxwood plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
