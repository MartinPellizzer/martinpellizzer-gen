    "intro": "Potentilla hyparctica subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
