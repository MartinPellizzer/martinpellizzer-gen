    "intro": "Phlomoides pseudokorovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's false beardgrass, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Phlomoides pseudokorovinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
