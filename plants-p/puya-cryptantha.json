    "intro": "Puya cryptantha, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Puya cryptantha is also known for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
