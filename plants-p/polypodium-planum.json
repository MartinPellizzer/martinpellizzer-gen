    "intro": "Polypodium planum, commonly known as the flat fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. The plant features a broad, flat frond with a distinctive, segmented appearance, which helps it maximize light absorption. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation. Polypodium planum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
