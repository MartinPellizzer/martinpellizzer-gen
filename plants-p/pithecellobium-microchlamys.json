    "intro": "Pithecellobium microchlamys, commonly known as the small-chalmer's pithecellobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered pods that contain edible seeds, which are sometimes used in local cuisines. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
