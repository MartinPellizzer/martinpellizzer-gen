    "intro": "Polypodium caespitosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, often forming dense mats on soil or stone. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into many small, lance-shaped segments. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium caespitosum is well adapted to moist, acidic environments and is often found in forest understories."
