It is characterized by its striking, pyramid-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white flowers clustered together. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, dark green bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. This plant is not only botanically interesting but also holds cultural significance in traditional medicine and rituals."
