    "intro": "Pyrus angeli, commonly known as the Angel's pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 4\u20138 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for pear breeding programs. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
