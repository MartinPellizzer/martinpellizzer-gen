    "intro": "Polypodium asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaved huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, across parts of Southeast Asia. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium asterolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
