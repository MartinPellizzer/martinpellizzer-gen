    "intro": "Polysphaeria zombensis, commonly known as the zombie sphere plant, is a unique species of algae-like organism found in the deep, nutrient-rich waters of the Zomben Sea. It is characterized by its gelatinous, spherical structures that resemble clusters of floating orbs. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and absorbs nutrients through its translucent, membrane-like surface. Its most intriguing feature is its ability to bioluminesce, emitting a faint green glow at night. This bioluminescence is believed to attract certain deep-sea organisms, playing a role in the local ecosystem's food chain."
