    "intro": "Pellionia minima, commonly known as the dwarf pellionia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its lush foliage. Due to its compact size, it is well-suited for container planting or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
