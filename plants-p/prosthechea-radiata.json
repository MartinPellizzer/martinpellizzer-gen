The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, arranged in a radiate or star-like pattern. Its inflorescence is typically terminal, with flowers opening sequentially from the base to the tip. Prosthechea radiata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
