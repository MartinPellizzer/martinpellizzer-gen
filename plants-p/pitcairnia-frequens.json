    "intro": "Pitcairnia frequens, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
