    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. taishanensis, commonly known as the Taishan cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Shandong Province in China, this plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its unique floral display makes it a prized addition to botanical gardens and horticultural collections. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
