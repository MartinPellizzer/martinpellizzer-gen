It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, upright growth. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin, often with a silvery-white underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant."
