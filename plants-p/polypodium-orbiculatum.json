    "intro": "Polypodium orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium orbiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
