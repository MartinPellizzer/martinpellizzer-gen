    "intro": "Panicum commonsianum, commonly known as common panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing panicles that are often seen in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental grass."
