    "intro": "Pseudaleia, commonly known as the false flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its showy, often red or orange flowers. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce capsules as fruit. Pseudaleia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking floral display. They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
