    "intro": "Pteris foemina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients. Pteris foemina is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
