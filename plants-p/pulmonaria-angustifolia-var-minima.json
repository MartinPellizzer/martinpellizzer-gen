    "intro": "Pulmonaria angustifolia var. minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in calcareous soils. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
