    "intro": "Pteroselinum nebrodense, commonly known as the Sicilian parsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, celery, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and small white or greenish flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are often used in Mediterranean cuisine for their mild, parsley-like flavor. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders."
