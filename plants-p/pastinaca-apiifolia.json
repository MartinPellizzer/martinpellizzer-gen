It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. Its roots are cylindrical and typically have a yellowish or white color, and they are often used in traditional medicine.
