    "intro": "Platanthera orbiculata f. lehorsii, commonly known as the Lehorsii coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands where it forms symbiotic relationships with certain mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in a spike, and it is often difficult to detect due to its lack of leaves and its reliance on its fungal partners. This unique ecological niche makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant-fungal interactions."
