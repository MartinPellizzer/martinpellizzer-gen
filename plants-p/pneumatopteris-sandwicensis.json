    "intro": "Pneumatopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
