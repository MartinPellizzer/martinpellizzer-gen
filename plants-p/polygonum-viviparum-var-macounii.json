It is characterized by its erect stems that often produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors. It is known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative growth, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
