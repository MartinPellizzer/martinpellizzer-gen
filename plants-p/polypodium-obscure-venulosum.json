    "intro": "Polypodium obscure-venulosum, commonly known as the obscure-veined polypody, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of veins that give it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
