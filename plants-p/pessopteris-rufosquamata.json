    "intro": "Pessopteris rufosquamata, commonly known as the red-scaled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant features a rhizome that is covered in reddish-brown scales, giving it its common name. It is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance that aids in photosynthesis in water."
