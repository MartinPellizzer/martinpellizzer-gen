It is characterized by its striking white petals that contrast with its green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, typical of the Papaveraceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
