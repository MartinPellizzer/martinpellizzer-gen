    "intro": "Polypodium leucosticton var. hartwegianum, commonly known as the Hartwig's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are usually bipinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
