It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and unique foliage make it an attractive addition to shaded or semi-shaded environments."
