    "intro": "Pyropsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom infrequently, making the plant highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pyropsis is considered endangered in many regions."
