These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble orchids. Platylobium species typically grow in heathlands and sandy soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The flowers are usually borne on slender stems and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
