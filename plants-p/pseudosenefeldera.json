    "intro": "Pseudosenefeldera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species."
