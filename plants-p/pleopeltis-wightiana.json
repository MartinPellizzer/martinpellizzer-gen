    "intro": "Pleopeltis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety hair. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
