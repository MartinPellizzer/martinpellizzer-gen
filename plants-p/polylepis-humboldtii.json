    "intro": "Polylepis humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's polylepis, is a tree species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against forest fires. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Polylepis humboldtii plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various endemic species."
