    "intro": "Parapottsia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plants have a dense, cushion-like structure with tightly packed leaves that help reduce water loss. Parapottsia species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on rocks or tree bark. Their spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are usually short and inconspicuous."
