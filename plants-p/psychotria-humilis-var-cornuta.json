It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The variety 'cornuta' is distinguished by its elongated, horn-like structures on the stems, which are believed to be a unique morphological feature."
