    "intro": "Pleopeltis rosei, commonly known as the rose calypso, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that often display a striking pinkish or reddish hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil to flourish. Its intricate morphology and vibrant coloration make it a sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pleopeltis rosei is considered endangered in its natural range."
