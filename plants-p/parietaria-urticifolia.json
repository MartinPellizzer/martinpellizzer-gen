    "intro": "Parietaria urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in waste areas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are pollinated by insects. Parietaria urticifolia is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it a common weed in various habitats."
