    "intro": "Pontederia brevipetiolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces dense clusters of blue-violet flowers, which bloom from summer to fall. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water flow and quality. It is commonly found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
