    "intro": "Platycoryne crocea subsp. montis-elgon, commonly known as the Mont Elgon orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
