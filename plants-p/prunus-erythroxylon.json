    "intro": "Prunus erythroxylon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, shiny seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
