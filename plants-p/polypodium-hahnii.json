    "intro": "Polypodium hahnii, commonly known as the Hahn's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Polypodium hahnii has rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes."
