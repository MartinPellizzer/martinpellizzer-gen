    "intro": "Pilea herniarioides var. perexigua, commonly known as the miniature pilea or dwarf pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, though it is more appreciated for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive appearance."
