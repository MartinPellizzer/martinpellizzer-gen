    "intro": "Pimpinella duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its delicate white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
