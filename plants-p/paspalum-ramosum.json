    "intro": "Paspalum ramosum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Paspalum ramosum is adapted to tolerate both flooding and drought, making it a resilient species in fluctuating moisture conditions."
