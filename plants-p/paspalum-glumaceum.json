    "intro": "Paspalum glumaceum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic habitats. Paspalum glumaceum is often found in regions with high humidity and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding."
