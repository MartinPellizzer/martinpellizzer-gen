The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
