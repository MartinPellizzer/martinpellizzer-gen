    "intro": "Poa annua var. plicata, commonly known as the folded annual bluegrass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive folded leaf blades, which give it a unique appearance compared to other Poa species. This plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a short stature and produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The folded leaves are a key identifying feature, making it easily distinguishable from other grasses."
