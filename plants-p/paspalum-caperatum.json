    "intro": "Paspalum caperatum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Paspalum caperatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
