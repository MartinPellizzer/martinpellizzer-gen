    "intro": "Physalis purpurea, commonly known as the purple husk tomato, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red berries enclosed in a papery calyx that persists after the fruit has matured. These berries are edible when fully ripe and are often used in culinary applications. Physalis purpurea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and edible gardens."
