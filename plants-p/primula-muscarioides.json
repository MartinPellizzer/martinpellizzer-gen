    "intro": "Primula muscarioides, commonly known as the musk primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or shaded garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists."
