    "intro": "Phymatopsis majoensis, commonly known as the Majoensis Phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Phymatopsis majoensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
