    "intro": "Polypodium marginale, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, ovate pinnae that have serrated margins. The plant produces spores in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
