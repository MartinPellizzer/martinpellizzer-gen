    "intro": "Podosperma pollackii, commonly known as the Armenian snowbell, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers and leathery, oval leaves. The plant produces distinctive woody capsules that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountainous conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Podosperma pollackii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
