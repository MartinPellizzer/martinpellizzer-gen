It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
