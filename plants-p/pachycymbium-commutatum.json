    "intro": "Pachycymbium commutatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The botanical features of Pachycymbium commutatum make it a unique and visually striking addition to tropical botanical gardens."
