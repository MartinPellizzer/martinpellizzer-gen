    "intro": "Phlox bryoides, commonly known as the rock phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of fragrant, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
