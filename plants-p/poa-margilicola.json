    "intro": "Poa margilicola, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Poa margilicola is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of alpine vegetation, supporting various pollinators and soil stabilization in mountain ecosystems."
