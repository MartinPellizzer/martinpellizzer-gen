    "intro": "Picris conyzoides, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
