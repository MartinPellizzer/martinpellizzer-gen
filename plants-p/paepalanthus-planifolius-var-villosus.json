    "intro": "Paepalanthus planifolius var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy flatleaf puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of broad, flat leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and can grow up to several feet in length, forming a sturdy, water-holding structure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It is well adapted to the high-altitude, arid environments of its native habitat."
