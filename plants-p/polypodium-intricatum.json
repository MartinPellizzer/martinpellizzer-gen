    "intro": "Polypodium intricatum, commonly known as the delicate fern or the intricate polypody, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
