    "intro": "Poa tenuiculmis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Poa tenuiculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
