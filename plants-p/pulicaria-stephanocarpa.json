    "intro": "Pulicaria stephanocarpa, commonly known as the rock rose or stephanocarpa fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, gravelly soils, and coastal areas. Pulicaria stephanocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
