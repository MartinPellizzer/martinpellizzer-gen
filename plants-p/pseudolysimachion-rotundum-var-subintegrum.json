    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion rotundum var. subintegrum, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
