    "intro": "Proserpinaca serrata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its unique morphology helps it resist wind and salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Proserpinaca serrata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
