It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its growth habit and structure make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions, showcasing its resilience in desert ecosystems."
