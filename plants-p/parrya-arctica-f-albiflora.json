    "intro": "Parrya arctica f. albiflora, commonly known as the Arctic parrya, is a rare alpine plant native to the Arctic regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
