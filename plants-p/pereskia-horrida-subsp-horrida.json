    "intro": "Pereskia horrida subsp. horrida, commonly known as the rough pereskia, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by orange-yellow fruits. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and may have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Pereskia horrida subsp. horrida is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
