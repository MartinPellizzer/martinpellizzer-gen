    "intro": "Paracyclea wattii, commonly known as the wattii cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and its role in studying plant evolution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paracycyclea wattii is also considered a vulnerable species."
