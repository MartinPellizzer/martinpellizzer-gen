    "intro": "Photinia hirsuta var. lobulata, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery foliage that provides a lush, full appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or container planting. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
