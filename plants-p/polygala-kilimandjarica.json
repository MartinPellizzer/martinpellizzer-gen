    "intro": "Polygala kilimandjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
