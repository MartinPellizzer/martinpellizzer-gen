    "intro": "Pseudocorchorus alatus, commonly known as the winged pseudocorchorus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it resilient to drought conditions. Pseudocorchorus alatus is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
