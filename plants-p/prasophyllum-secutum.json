    "intro": "Prasophyllum secutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in sandy or loamy soils. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a few broad, linear leaves, and it produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
