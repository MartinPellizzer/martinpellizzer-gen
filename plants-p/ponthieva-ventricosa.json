    "intro": "Ponthieva ventricosa, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often inflated and can float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to water gardens. It thrives in warm, still freshwater environments and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching several feet in diameter. Due to its rapid growth, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
