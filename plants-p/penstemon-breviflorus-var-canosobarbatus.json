    "intro": "Penstemon breviflorus var. canosobarbatus, commonly known as the graybarbed penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
