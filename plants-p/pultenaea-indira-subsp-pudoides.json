    "intro": "Pultenaea indira subsp. pudoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
