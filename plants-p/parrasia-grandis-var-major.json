    "intro": "Parrasia grandis var. major, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features long, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often used in water gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its rapid growth, it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth in natural habitats."
