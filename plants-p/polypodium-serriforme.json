    "intro": "Polypodium serriforme, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces new fronds throughout the growing season. Polypodium serriforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
