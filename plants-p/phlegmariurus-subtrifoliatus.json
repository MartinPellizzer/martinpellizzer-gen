    "intro": "Phlegmariurus subtrifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaf liverwort, is a member of the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its thalloid structure. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a flat, green thallus that is often divided into lobes, giving it a leaf-like appearance. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. This liverwort plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
