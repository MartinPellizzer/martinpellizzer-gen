    "intro": "Phacelia heterophylla var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, fuzzy leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common sight in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
