    "intro": "Pleione humilis var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
