    "intro": "Pyrola soldanellifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northern Appalachian Mountains. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Pyrola soldanellifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
