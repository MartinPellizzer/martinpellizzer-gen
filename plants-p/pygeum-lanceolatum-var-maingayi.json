It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and long, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also of interest for horticultural and conservation purposes."
