    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus var. minor, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater stands. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often slightly curved and have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
