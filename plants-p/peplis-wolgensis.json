    "intro": "Peplis wolgensis, commonly known as the Wolgen's peplis, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
