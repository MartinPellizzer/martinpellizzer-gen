    "intro": "Polypodium quadripinnatum, commonly known as the four-pinnate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, which is typical of its epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
