    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. truncata, commonly known as the Chinese poplar or narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, ovate leaves that are often truncate at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
