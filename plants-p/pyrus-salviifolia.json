    "intro": "Pyrus salviifolia, commonly known as the saveloy pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Pyrus salviifolia is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications."
