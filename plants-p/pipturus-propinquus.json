    "intro": "Pipturus propinquus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a tall, evergreen tree fern characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, enabling propagation through spore dispersal. Pipturus propinquus plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
