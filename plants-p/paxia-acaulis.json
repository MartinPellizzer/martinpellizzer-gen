    "intro": "Paxia acaulis, commonly known as the stalkless paxia, is a unique flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Paxia acaulis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
