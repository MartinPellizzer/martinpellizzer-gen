    "intro": "Potentilla reclinis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy surface. Potentilla reclinis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
