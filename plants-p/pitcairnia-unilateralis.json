    "intro": "Pitcairnia unilateralis, commonly known as the single-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated rosette of dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing vibrant orange or red flowers, which are typically showy and attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
