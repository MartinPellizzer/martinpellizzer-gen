    "intro": "Panicum myosuroides var. sudanense, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for pasture and erosion control. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sudan grass is widely cultivated for forage and has been introduced to many parts of the world for agricultural purposes."
