    "intro": "Phoebe mayana, commonly known as the Mayan phoebe, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters and has dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, blue-black berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Phoebe mayana thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a significant species in its native habitat."
