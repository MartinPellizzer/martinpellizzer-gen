It consists of about 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Pollichia species are valued for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
