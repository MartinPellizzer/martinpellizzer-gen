    "intro": "Packera clevelandii var. heterophylla, commonly known as Cleveland's fleabane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to ovate leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
