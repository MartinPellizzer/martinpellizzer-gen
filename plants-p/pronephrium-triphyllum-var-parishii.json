    "intro": "Pronephrium triphyllum var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's three-leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its three-lobed leaves that are often submerged, with small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous adaptations. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often in nutrient-poor environments."
