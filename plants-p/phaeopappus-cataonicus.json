    "intro": "Phaeopappus cataonicus, commonly known as the Cataonic brownweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
