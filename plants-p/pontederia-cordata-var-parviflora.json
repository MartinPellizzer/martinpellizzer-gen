    "intro": "Pontederia cordata var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pickerelweed, is a aquatic herb native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, lavender to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
