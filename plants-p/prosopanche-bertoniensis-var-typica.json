    "intro": "Prosopanche bertoniensis var. typica, commonly known as the typical Bertoni's candleplant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss. This variant is noted for its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
