    "intro": "Parnassia palustris var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine white crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of waxy, green leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that resemble small crowfoots. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
