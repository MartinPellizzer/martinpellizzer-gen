    "intro": "Pilosella radula, commonly known as the rock pilosella, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Pilosella radula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or gravelly slopes."
