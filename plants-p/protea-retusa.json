    "intro": "Protea retusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, pinkish-white flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers. Protea retusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
