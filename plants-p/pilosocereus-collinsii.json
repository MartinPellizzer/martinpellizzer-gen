    "intro": "Pilosocereus collinsii, commonly known as the Collins's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, providing protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bats and insects. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water requirements. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
