    "intro": "Pseudelephantopus funckii, commonly known as the mountain glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
