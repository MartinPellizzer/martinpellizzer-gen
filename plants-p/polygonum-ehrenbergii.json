    "intro": "Polygonum ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert knotweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Polygonum ehrenbergii is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in conditions where many other plants struggle."
