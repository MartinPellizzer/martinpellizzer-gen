    "intro": "Pleurothallis ramulosa, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree branches and deriving moisture from the humid atmosphere. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
