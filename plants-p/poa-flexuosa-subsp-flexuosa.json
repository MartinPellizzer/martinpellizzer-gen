    "intro": "Poa flexuosa subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
