    "intro": "Plantago luzuloidea, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
