    "intro": "Pseudostriga cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, slender stem with no true leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
