It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense, cylindrical clusters of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover."
