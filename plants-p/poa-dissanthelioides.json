    "intro": "Poa dissanthelioides, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
