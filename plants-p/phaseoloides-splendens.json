    "intro": "Phaseoloides splendens, commonly known as the golden bean vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and climbing habit, often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, though they are not as widely cultivated as other legumes. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and potential nutritional benefits, it is gaining interest in both horticultural and agricultural contexts."
