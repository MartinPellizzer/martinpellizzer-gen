    "intro": "Pinus montezumae subsp. mezambrana, commonly known as the Mexican bristle pine, is a subspecies of the Mexican pine native to high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive bristle-like cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests. Its cones mature over several years and release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
