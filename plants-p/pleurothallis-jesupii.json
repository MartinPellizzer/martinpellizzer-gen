    "intro": "Pleurothallis jesupii, commonly known as the Jesup's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is closely related to other species within the Pleurothallis genus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
