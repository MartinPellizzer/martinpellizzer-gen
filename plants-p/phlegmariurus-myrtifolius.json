    "intro": "Phlegmariurus myrtifolius, commonly known as the Myrtle-leaved Clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, facilitating its reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions."
