    "intro": "Pellegrinia coronaria, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found growing along shorelines and in coastal dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Pellegrinia coronaria is also notable for its medicinal properties, used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments."
