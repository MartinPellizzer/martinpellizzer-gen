    "intro": "Prunus conradinae f. pilosula, commonly known as the pilosula form of the Conradina cherry, is a rare and unique variant of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. This plant is native to specific regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
