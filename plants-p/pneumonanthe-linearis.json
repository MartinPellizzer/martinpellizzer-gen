    "intro": "Pneumonanthe linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that grow in a compact rosette formation. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Pneumonanthe linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
