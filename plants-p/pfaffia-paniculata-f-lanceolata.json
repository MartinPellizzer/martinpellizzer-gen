    "intro": "Pfaffia paniculata f. lanceolata, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Pfaffia paniculata species. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles. Its root system is highly valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research remains limited. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in its native range."
