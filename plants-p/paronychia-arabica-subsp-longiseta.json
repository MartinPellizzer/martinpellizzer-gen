    "intro": "Paronychia arabica subsp. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hair sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to survive in conditions of limited water availability."
