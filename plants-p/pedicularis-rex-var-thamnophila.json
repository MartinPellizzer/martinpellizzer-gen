    "intro": "Pedicularis rex var. thamnophila, commonly known as the royal monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
