    "intro": "Panicum austromontanum, commonly known as the southern panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a fine layer of hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
