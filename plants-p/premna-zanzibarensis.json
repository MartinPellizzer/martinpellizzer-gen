    "intro": "Premna zanzibarensis, commonly known as Zanzibar glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and the presence of small, round, orange-red berries that develop after flowering. Premna zanzibarensis is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
