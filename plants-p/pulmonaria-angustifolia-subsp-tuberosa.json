It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often spotted with purple or pink. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, pink to white flowers during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. This subspecies is closely related to other Pulmonaria species and is often used in garden settings for its attractive foliage and floral display."
