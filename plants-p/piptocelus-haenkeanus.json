It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in moist, shady environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
