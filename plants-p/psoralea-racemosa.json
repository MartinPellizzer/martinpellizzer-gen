It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemate clusters. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea racemosa is often found in open vegetation and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
