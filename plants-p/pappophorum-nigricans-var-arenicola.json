    "intro": "Pappophorum nigricans var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control in dry landscapes."
