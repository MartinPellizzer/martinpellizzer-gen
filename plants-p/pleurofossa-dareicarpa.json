    "intro": "Pleurofossa dareicarpa, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, deep red petals with contrasting green veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are small but numerous, often blooming in clusters during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
