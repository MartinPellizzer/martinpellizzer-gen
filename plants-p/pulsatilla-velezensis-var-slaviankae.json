    "intro": "Pulsatilla velezensis var. slaviankae, commonly known as the Slavianka pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
