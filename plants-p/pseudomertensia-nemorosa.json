    "intro": "Pseudomertensia nemorosa, commonly known as the forest mertensia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually blue or violet and bloom in late spring. Pseudomertensia nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
