    "intro": "Pteris longifolia var. decrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to purify water in natural settings."
