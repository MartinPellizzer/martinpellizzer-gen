It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle elegance to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare flora."
