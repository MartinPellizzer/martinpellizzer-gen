    "intro": "Pycreus alleizettei, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
