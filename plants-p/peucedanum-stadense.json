    "intro": "Peucedanum stadense, commonly known as the Stadense cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are small and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which aids in their dispersal. Peucedanum stadense is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is considered a characteristic species of certain habitats."
