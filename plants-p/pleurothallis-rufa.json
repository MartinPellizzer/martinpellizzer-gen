    "intro": "Pleurothallis rufa, commonly known as the red-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically produces small, intricate blooms with a distinctive red or pink lip, which is a key feature in its identification. Pleurothallis rufa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse orchid family and its adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
