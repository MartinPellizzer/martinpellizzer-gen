    "intro": "Platantheroides parvidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
