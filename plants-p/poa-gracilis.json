    "intro": "Poa gracilis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue-green. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually borne on short, bracted stalks. Poa gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
