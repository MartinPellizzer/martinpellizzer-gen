    "intro": "Papaver anomalum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features striking, bright red to orange flowers with a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaveraceae family. The plant has a short stem and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
