    "intro": "Polygonum taliense, commonly known as the Taliense knotweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Polygonum taliense is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
