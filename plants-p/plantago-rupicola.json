    "intro": "Plantago rupicola, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
