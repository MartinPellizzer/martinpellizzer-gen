    "intro": "Pyrus glaucescens, commonly known as the white-leafed pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that are often bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys. Pyrus glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
