    "intro": "Pallenis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, silver-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along dunes and rocky shores. Pallenis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
