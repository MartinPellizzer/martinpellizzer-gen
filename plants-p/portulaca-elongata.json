    "intro": "Portulaca elongata, commonly known as the slender portulaca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Portulacaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Portulaca elongata is native to southern Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the Americas and Australia, where it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
