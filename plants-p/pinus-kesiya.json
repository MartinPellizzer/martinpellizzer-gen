    "intro": "Pinus kesiya, commonly known as the Khasi pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes."
