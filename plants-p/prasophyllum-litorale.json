    "intro": "Prasophyllum litorale, commonly known as the coastal leek orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt lakes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
