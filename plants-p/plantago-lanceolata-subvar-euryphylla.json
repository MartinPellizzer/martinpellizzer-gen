    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata subvar. euryphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, with a hairy texture and a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their soothing and healing effects on skin irritations."
