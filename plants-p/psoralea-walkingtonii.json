    "intro": "Psoralea walkingtonii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish or brownish pea-like flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
