    "intro": "Polygala stenocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
