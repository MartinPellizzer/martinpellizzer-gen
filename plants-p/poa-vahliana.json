It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
