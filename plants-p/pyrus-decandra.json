    "intro": "Pyrus decandra, commonly known as common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its dense, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Pyrus decandra is also noted for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
