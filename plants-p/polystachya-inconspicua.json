    "intro": "Polystachya inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous polystachya, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant features a short rhizome with a single, narrow leaf and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its subtle appearance, it is sometimes overlooked despite its ecological significance in its native habitat."
