It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland scrub habitats. Psilostrophe lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
