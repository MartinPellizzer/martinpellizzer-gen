    "intro": "Polypodium subcrenatum, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often folded and have a distinctive, wavy margin. The fronds are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is wiry and covered with small, scale-like structures, which help in anchoring it to its substrate."
