    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and conical or irregular crown. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and faces conservation challenges."
