    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
