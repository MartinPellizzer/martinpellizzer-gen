    "intro": "Pseudogomphrena, commonly known as the purpletop or false gomphrena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials, featuring showy, often pink or purple bracts that resemble flowers. They have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked beneath the vibrant bracts. Pseudogomphrena is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
