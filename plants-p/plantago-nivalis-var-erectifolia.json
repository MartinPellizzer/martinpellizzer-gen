    "intro": "Plantago nivalis var. erectifolia, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
