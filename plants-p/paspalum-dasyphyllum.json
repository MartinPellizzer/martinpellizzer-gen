    "intro": "Paspalum dasyphyllum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in shades of green or brown. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in wetland areas due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Paspalum dasyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
