    "intro": "Poa flavicans, commonly known as the yellow meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa flavicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
