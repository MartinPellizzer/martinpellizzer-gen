    "intro": "Perpensum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant with strikingly beautiful pink or white flowers that bloom above the water's surface. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and China, where it has been revered for centuries. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Perpensum is known for its ability to thrive in still water and is often cultivated in ponds and gardens for its ornamental value. Its symbolic significance in various cultures further highlights its botanical and cultural importance."
