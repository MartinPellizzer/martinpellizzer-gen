    "intro": "Poa laxa subsp. stricta, commonly known as the stiff bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
