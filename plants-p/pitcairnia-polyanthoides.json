    "intro": "Pitcairnia polyanthoides, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common adaptation in its native humid, high-altitude environment. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with multiple flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
