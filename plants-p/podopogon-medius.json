It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
