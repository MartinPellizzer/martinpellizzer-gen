    "intro": "Peltopus alveatus, commonly known as the roughleaf hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, wavy-edged leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
