    "intro": "Polystichum horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading fronds that form a dense, low-growing carpet. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
