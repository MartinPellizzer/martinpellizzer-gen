    "intro": "Petrophile brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. Petrophile brevifolia is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees."
