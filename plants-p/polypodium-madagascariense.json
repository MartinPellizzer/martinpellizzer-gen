    "intro": "Polypodium madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of polypody that is native to Madagascar. It is a tropical fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates. This fern is notable for its unique adaptations to its native habitat, including its ability to absorb moisture from the air."
