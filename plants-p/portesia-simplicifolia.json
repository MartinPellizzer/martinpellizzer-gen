    "intro": "Portesia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved portesia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Portesia simplicifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along riverbanks."
