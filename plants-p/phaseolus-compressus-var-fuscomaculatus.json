    "intro": "Phaseolus compressus var. fuscomaculatus, commonly known as the black-seeded bush bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing dark brown, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. This variety is well adapted to warm climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
