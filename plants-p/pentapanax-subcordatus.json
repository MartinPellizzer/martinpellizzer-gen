    "intro": "Pentapanax subcordatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf five-vein plant, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of five elongated leaflets with a distinctive, broad base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in understory layers. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
