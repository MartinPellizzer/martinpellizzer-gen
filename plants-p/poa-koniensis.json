    "intro": "Poa koniensis, commonly known as the Konia grass, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typical of grasses, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Poa koniensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
