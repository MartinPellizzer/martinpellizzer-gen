It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland and coastal habitats. The plant has slender, narrow leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads. Pseudobromus tenuifolius is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
