    "intro": "Poa lagopoides, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Poa lagopoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
