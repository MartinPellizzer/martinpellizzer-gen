    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 mutinensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Potentilla \u00d7 mutinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
