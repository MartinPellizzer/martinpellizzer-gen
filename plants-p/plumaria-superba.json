    "intro": "Plumaria superba, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive central purple spot. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period typically occurs during the dry season, making it a symbol of resilience and beauty in local cultures. The botanical features of Plumaria superba make it both an ornamental and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
