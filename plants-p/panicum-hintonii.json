    "intro": "Panicum hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
