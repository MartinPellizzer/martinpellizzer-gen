    "intro": "Pinus helenica, commonly known as the Greek pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones maturing into woody seed cones that release winged seeds. Its needles are long, slender, and typically retain their color throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. Pinus helenica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
