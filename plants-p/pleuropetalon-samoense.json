    "intro": "Pleuropetalon samoense, commonly known as the Samoan star-flower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Samoa in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
