    "intro": "Pleopeltis polycarpos, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
