    "intro": "Piptanthocereus azureus, commonly known as the Azure Nightshade Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The cactus also has a shallow root system that allows it to efficiently absorb water after rare rainfall events."
