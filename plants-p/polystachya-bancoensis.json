    "intro": "Polystachya bancoensis, commonly known as the Banko's bamboo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of multiple racemes, each bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its leaves are long and narrow, adapted for efficient water retention."
