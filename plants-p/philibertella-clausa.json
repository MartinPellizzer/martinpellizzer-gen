    "intro": "Philibertella clausa, commonly known as the closed-leaf lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
