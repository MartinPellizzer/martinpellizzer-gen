    "intro": "Pinus quevedoi, commonly known as the Quevedo pine, is a species of conifer native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The Quevedo pine plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
