    "intro": "Physaria vigana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows close to the ground, with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Physaria vigana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
