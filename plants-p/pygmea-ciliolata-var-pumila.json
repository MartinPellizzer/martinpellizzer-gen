    "intro": "Pygmea ciliolata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pygmea ciliolata, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
