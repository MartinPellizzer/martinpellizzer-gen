    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal. This variety is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its medicinal and ecological roles."
