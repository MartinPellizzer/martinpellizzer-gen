    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. halleri, commonly known as Haller's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
