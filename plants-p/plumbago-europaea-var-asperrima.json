    "intro": "Plumbago europaea var. asperrima, commonly known as rough plumbago, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and structural form."
