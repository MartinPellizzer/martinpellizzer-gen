    "intro": "Plantago hedleyi, commonly known as the Hedley's plantain, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for their healing properties."
