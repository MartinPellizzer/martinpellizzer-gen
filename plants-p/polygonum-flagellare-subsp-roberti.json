    "intro": "Polygonum flagellare subsp. roberti, commonly known as the red-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an invasive species in some regions."
