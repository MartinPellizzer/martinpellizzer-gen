    "intro": "Puya gutteana, commonly known as the red-banded puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears vibrant red and yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like structures. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Puya gutteana is a slow-growing perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
