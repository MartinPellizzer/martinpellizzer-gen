    "intro": "Premna parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic premna, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Verbenaceae family. It attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host, which can lead to the host's decline. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Premna parasitica is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments."
