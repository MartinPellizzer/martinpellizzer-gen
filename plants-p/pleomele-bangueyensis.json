    "intro": "Pleomele bangueyensis, commonly known as the Bornean pleomele, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Borneo. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
