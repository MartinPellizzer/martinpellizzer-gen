    "intro": "Psilotrichum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves and small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are closely clustered, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Psilotrichum angustifolium plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
