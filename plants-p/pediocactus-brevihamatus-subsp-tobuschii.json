    "intro": "Pediocactus brevihamatus subsp. tobuschii, commonly known as the Tobusch cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a globular stem with a greenish-gray color and is covered in short, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in June and July. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
