    "intro": "Physalis viscosa var. fuscomaculata, commonly known as the hairy currant or sticky gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing bright orange berries. These berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are generally tart and acidic. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
