    "intro": "Pitcairnia integrifolia, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves forming a rosette that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the early morning and last for several weeks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
