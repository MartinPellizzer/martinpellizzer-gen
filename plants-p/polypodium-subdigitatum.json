    "intro": "Polypodium subdigitatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf wall fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive fan-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
