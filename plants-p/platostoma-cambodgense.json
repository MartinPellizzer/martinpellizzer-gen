    "intro": "Platostoma cambodgense, commonly known as the Cambodian flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its leathery, flat thallus with a distinctive greenish-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for survival. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
