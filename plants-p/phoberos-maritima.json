    "intro": "Phoberos maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing near the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and tidal influences. Phoberos maritima plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
