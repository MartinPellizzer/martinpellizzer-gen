    "intro": "Pyrus fugax, commonly known as the transient pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish pomes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks. Pyrus fugax is noted for its ephemeral nature, with its leaves and fruits often disappearing by late summer."
