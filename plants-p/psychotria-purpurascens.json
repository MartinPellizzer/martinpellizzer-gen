    "intro": "Psychotria purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking purple stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Psychotria purpurascens is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
