    "intro": "Phyllanthus gneissicus var. toninensis, commonly known as the Toninensis Phyllanthus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
