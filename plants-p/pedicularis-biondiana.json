    "intro": "Pedicularis biondiana, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized root system. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and is often found in rocky or open woodland areas."
