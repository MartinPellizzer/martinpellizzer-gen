    "intro": "Procris lagunensis, commonly known as the Laguna orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the wetlands of the Laguna Madre in Texas. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish water, adapting to the unique saline conditions of its habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water, and its leaves are narrow and strap-like, reducing water loss. Due to habitat degradation, Procris lagunensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
