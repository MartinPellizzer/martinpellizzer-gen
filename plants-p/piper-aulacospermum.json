    "intro": "Piper aulacospermum, commonly known as the white-spleenwort pepper, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that turns dark when mature. Native to Central and South America, it is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests."
