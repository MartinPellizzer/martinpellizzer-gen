    "intro": "Panicum amarum var. minus, commonly known as lesser prostrate barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated areas."
