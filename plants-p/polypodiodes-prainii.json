    "intro": "Polypodiodes prainii, commonly known as the Prain's polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is creeping and often covered with small, scale-like structures. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
