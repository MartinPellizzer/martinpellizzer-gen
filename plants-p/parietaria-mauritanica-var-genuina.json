    "intro": "Parietaria mauritanica var. genuina, commonly known as the Mediterranean wall-rocket, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing in rocky or disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective ground cover in suitable climates."
