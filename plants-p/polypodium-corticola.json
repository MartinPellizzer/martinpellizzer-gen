    "intro": "Polypodium corticola, commonly known as the bark polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, leathery layer of bark-like tissue, which gives it its common name. The plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
