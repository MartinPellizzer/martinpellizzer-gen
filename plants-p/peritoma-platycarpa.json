    "intro": "Peritoma platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited peritoma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
