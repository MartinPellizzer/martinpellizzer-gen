It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. Pelargonium serra is relatively drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or container planting."
