    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous knotweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through runners, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands."
