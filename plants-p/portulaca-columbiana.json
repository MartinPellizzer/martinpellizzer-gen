    "intro": "Portulaca columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia purslane, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Portulaca columbiana is drought-tolerant and commonly used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
