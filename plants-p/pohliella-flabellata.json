    "intro": "Pohliella flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pohliellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures that form a dense, mat-like growth on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically thrives in humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its morphology includes small, fleshy thalli with a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance, which gives it its common name. Pohliella flabellata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
