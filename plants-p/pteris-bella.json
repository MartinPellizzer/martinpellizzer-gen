    "intro": "Pteris bella, commonly known as the pretty water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with numerous small pinnae arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris bella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
