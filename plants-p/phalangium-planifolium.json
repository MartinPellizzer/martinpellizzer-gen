    "intro": "Phalangium planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved phalangium, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Phalangium planifolium is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
