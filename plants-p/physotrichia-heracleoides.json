    "intro": "Physotrichia heracleoides, commonly known as the giant spider-plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
