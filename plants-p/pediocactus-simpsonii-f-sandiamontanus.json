    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii f. sandiamontanus, commonly known as the Sandia montana cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico and Texas. It is a compact, short-stemmed plant with a dense covering of spines and produces vibrant yellow flowers in spring. The plant's stems are typically ribbed and can develop a bluish-gray hue when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
