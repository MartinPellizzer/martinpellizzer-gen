    "intro": "Palaquium cinereum, commonly known as the silverleaf palaquium, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
