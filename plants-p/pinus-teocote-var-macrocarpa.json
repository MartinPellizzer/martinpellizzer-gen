    "intro": "Pinus teocote var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a variety of the teocote pine native to southern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of three, and it is characterized by its slow growth rate and longevity. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
