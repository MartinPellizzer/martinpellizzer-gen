    "intro": "Pararistolochia incisiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to animals and humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties."
