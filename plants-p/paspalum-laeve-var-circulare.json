    "intro": "Paspalum laeve var. circulare, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
