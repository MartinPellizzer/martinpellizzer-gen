    "intro": "Prosopis glandulosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping mesquite, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought. Its morphology makes it well-suited for erosion control and as a pioneer species in disturbed landscapes."
