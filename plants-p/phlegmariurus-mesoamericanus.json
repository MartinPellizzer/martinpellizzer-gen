It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, club-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its contribution to the biodiversity of tropical and subtropical regions."
