    "intro": "Pimpinella paniculata, commonly known as the clustered cow-weed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often forms dense clusters, giving it its common name. Pimpinella paniculata is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
