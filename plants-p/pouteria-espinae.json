    "intro": "Pouteria espinae, commonly known as the Espina's soursop, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but with distinct flavor and texture. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches full maturity, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its edible fruit. Pouteria espinae thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
