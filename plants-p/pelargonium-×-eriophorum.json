    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 eriophorum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
