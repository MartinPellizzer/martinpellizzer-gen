    "intro": "Pulmonaria murinii subsp. continentalis, commonly known as the European lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that range from green to silver in color. The plant produces upright spikes of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and floral display contribute to its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
