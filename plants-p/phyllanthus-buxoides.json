It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant."
