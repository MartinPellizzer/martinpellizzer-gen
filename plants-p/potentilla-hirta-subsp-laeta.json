    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subsp. laeta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, glandular hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions."
