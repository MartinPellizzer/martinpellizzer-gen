    "intro": "Paneion pratericola, commonly known as the Pratericola bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and often blue or violet hues. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paneion pratericola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
