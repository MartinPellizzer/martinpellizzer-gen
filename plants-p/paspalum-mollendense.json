    "intro": "Paspalum mollendense, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments. Paspalum mollendense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
