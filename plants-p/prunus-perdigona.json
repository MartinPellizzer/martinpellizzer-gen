    "intro": "Prunus perdigona, commonly known as the Spanish cherry or the wild cherry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and features alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by edible drupes that are usually red or yellow when mature. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Prunus perdigona is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its fruit and wood."
