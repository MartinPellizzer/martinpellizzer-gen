    "intro": "Pinguicula bicolor f. gorcensis, commonly known as the Gorcenskaya butterwort, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects, a feature typical of the genus Pinguicula. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
