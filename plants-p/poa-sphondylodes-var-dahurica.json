    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes var. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
