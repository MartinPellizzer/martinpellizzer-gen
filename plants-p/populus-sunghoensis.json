    "intro": "Populus sunghoensis, commonly known as the Korean poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Korea. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects."
