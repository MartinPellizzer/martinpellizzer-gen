    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. atrata, commonly known as the black pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. This variety is distinguished by its dark, almost black bark, which contrasts with the lighter bark of the typical whitebark pine. The needles are shorter and more densely packed, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with strong winds and low temperatures. The cones of Pinus pumilio var. atrata are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds in response to forest fires."
