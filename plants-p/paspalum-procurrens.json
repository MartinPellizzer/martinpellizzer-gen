    "intro": "Paspalum procurrens, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used in erosion control."
