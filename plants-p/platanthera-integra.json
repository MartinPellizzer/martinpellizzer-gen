    "intro": "Platanthera integra, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower that has a distinctive, sweet fragrance. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its ecological importance and is often found in calcareous soils."
