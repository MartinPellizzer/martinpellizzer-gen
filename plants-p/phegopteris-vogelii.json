    "intro": "Phegopteris vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
