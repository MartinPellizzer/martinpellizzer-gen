    "intro": "Portulaca carnosa, commonly known as the woolly portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Portulaca carnosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
