    "intro": "Primula pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
