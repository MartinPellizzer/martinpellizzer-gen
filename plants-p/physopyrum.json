    "intro": "Physopyrum, commonly known as the common fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It is characterized by its unique structure, with the fruit being a syconium, a specialized type of inflorescence that is a hollow, fleshy structure. The plant produces both male and female flowers within the same inflorescence, a process known as monoecious flowering. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Physopyrum species are widely cultivated for their edible fruits and are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia."
