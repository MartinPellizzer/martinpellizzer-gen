    "intro": "Pseudocinchona pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-shelled quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, thick-walled seeds and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine, primarily for its potential antimalarial properties. However, it is not as widely cultivated or studied as other members of the Cinchona genus."
