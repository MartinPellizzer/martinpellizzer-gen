    "intro": "Pyrus theodorovii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pear, is a variant of the pear tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically small, sweet, and edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. This plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit production."
