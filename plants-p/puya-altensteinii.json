    "intro": "Puya altensteinii, commonly known as the Altenstein's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant red flowers, which are often surrounded by long, narrow leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky soils and among shrubs. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Puya altensteinii is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
