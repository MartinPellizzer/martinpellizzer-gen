    "intro": "Poa compressa var. contracta, commonly known as the compact bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of other bluegrass species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
