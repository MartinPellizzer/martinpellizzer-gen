    "intro": "Pedicularis sibthorpii, commonly known as the Tibetan monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange with yellow markings, adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
