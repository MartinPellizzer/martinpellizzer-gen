    "intro": "Piper begoniiforme, commonly known as the begonia-like pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the Piperaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of begonias, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its fruit, which is not particularly notable."
