    "intro": "Pachycarpus grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The species is also valued for its ability to attract birds and insects due to its nectar-rich flowers."
