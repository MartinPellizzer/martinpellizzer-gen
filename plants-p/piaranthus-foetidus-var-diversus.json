    "intro": "Piaranthus foetidus var. diversus, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in full sun."
