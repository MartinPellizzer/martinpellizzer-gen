    "intro": "Plantago depressa var. montana, commonly known as mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
