    "intro": "Peltophorus ratnagirica, commonly known as the Ratnagiri mushroom, is a species of bracket fungus native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped cap and a woody, bracket-like stem. The mushroom typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist and shaded forest environments. Its fruiting bodies are often found in clusters, and it plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in its ecosystem. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists."
