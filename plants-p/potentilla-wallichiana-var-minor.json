It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in horticulture."
