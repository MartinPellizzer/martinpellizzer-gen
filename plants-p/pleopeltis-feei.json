    "intro": "Pleopeltis feei, commonly known as the Fee's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
