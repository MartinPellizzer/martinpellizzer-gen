    "intro": "Poa relaxa, commonly known as the tufted meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Poa relaxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
