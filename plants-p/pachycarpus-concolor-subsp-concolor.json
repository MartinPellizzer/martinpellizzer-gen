    "intro": "Pachycarpus concolor subsp. concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf pachycarpus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often forms dense thickets in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
