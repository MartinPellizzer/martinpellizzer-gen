    "intro": "Poa dusenii, commonly known as Dusen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in high-elevation areas and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
