    "intro": "Pitcairnia abyssicola, commonly known as the abyssal pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect water in its native habitat. Pitcairnia abyssicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
