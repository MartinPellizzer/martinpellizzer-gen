    "intro": "Pescatoria \u00d7 gairiana, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Pescatoria and Gairiana. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
