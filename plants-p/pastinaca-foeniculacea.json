    "intro": "Pastinaca foeniculacea, commonly known as the giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery, aromatic leaves that resemble those of common fennel. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine and are similar in appearance to those of wild parsnip. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
