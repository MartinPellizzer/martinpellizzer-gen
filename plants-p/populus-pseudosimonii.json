It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by woody fruits that disperse its seeds. The Yunnan poplar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
