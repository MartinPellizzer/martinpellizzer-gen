It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
