    "intro": "Poa lanuginosa var. neuquina, commonly known as the Neuqu\u00e9n velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in certain ecological settings."
