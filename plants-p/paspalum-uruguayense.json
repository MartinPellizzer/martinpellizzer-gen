    "intro": "Paspalum uruguayense, commonly known as the Uruguay grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalum uruguayense is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and withstand drought."
