    "intro": "Pachycereus pringlei f. constrictus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed organ pipe cactus, is a distinctive variant of the organ pipe cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are narrower than the typical form, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant features prominent areoles with spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
