    "intro": "Polypodium lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Polypodium lingua prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
