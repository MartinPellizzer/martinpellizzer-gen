    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule subsp. radicatum, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine white down. The subspecies radicatum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and deeper root system compared to the typical form of P. nudicaule."
