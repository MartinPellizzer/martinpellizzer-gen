    "intro": "Polypodium moupinense, commonly known as the Moupin fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water retention. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a leathery texture."
