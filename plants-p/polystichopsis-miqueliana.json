    "intro": "Polystichopsis miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polystichopsis miqueliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
