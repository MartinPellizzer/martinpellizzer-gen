It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium engleri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
