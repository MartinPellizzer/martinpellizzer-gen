    "intro": "Poa alpina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass. It is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, grass-like leaves. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where viable seeds are formed on the mother plant and can germinate while still attached. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
