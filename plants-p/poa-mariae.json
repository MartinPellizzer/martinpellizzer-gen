    "intro": "Poa mariae, commonly known as Marie's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Poa mariae is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
