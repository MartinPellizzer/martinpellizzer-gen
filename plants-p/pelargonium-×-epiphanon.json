    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 epiphanon, commonly known as the Royal Pelargonium, is a hybrid geranium species characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers. It is native to South Africa and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements. The plant typically features broad, velvety leaves and clusters of five-petaled blooms in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium \u00d7 epiphanon is often used in borders, containers, and as a bedding plant due to its compact growth habit and long flowering season."
