    "intro": "Polycarpaea rheophytica, commonly known as the stream orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in fast-flowing mountain streams. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, strap-shaped leaves that help reduce water resistance in its aquatic environment. It thrives in cool, shaded, and nutrient-rich stream beds, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
