    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurothillus aves-seriales, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it relies on its aerial roots for nutrient absorption. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in clusters. The plant's botanical characteristics include strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
