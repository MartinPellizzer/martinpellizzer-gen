    "intro": "Psidium claraense, commonly known as the Clarion guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Cura\u00e7ao. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically a small, round berry with a sweet, aromatic pulp and a single seed. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
