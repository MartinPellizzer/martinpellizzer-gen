It is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru, specifically in the region of Chachapoyas. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found at elevations between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
