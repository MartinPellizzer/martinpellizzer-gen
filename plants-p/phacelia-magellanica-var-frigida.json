    "intro": "Phacelia magellanica var. frigida, commonly known as the Magellan frost phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in cooler climates. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
