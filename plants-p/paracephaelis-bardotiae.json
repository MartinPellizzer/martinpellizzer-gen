    "intro": "Paracephaelis bardotiae, commonly known as the Bardot's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree roots or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing a unique epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
