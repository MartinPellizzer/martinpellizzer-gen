    "intro": "Poa cookii, commonly known as Cook's bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa cookii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitat."
