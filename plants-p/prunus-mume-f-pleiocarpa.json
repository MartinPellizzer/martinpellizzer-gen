    "intro": "Prunus mume f. pleiocarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited Chinese apricot, is a unique cultivar of the Japanese apricot. It is characterized by its ability to produce multiple fruits on a single stem, a trait that makes it distinctive among Prunus species. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is small, often yellow or orange, and has a fragrant, tart flavor, making it valuable for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
