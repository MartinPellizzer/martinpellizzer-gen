    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slow growth, longevity, and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree has a distinctive appearance with a gnarled trunk and a conical shape, and its needles are typically blue-green in color. It produces small, yellowish cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions."
