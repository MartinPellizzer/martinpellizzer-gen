    "intro": "Pitcairnia leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically stiff and covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which appear at the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia leprieurii is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
