    "intro": "Pteris vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a pale green color and a slightly glossy surface."
