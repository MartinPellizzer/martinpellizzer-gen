    "intro": "Ponerorchis nana, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
