    "intro": "Polypodium pseudoamoenum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
