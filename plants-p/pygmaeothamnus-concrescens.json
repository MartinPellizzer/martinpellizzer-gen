    "intro": "Pygmaeothamnus concrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pygmy thornbush, is a small shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Pygmaeothamnus concrescens is often used in native gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
