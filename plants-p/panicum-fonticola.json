    "intro": "Panicum fonticola, commonly known as the water panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, panicle-shaped inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its adaptability to aquatic environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
