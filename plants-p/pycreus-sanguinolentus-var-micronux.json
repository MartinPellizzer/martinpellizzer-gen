    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus var. micronux, commonly known as the Crimson-Blooded Dwarf, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, velvety leaves that range in color from deep crimson to burnt orange, depending on the light exposure. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique varietal name, *micronux*, refers to its exceptionally small size and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
