    "intro": "Papaver radicatum subsp. stefanssonii, commonly known as the Stefansson's poppy, is a rare and flowering plant native to specific regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and hairy, basal leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, short growing seasons of its native environment. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
