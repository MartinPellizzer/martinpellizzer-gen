    "intro": "Paspalum maculosum var. rotundiflorum, commonly known as the roundflower paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats or cushions on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural habitat. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy areas."
