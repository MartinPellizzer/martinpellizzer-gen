    "intro": "Peltophorum inerme, commonly known as the Indian peacock tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive crown of pendulous, feather-like leaves that turn bright red before falling in autumn. The tree produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and along roadsides for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
