    "intro": "Proustia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf proustia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it adaptable to various soil types. Proustia cuneata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
