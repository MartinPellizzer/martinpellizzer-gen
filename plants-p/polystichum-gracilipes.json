    "intro": "Polystichum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides. Polystichum gracilipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lace-like appearance."
