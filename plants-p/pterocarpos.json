    "intro": "Pterocarpos, commonly known as the African ebony, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their dense, dark wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The genus includes several species, such as Pterocarpos millettii and Pterocarpos erinaceus, which are often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The leaves are typically bipinnate, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. The fruit is a legume that contains several seeds, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat for various organisms."
