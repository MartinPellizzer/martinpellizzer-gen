    "intro": "Phyllitis mambare, commonly known as the Mambare water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, feathery segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phyllitis mambare plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
