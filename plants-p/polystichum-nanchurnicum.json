    "intro": "Polystichum nanchurnicum, commonly known as the Nanchung fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
