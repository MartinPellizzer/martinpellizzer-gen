    "intro": "Pyrus chelseana, commonly known as the Chelsea pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its attractive, rounded form and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pomes that ripen in late summer, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. The Chelsea pear is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
