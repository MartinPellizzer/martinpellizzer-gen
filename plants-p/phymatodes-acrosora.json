    "intro": "Phymatodes acrosora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Phymatodes acrosora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
