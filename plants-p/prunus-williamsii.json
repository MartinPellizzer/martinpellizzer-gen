    "intro": "Prunus williamsii, commonly known as Williams' cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. Prunus williamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to harsh, dry conditions."
