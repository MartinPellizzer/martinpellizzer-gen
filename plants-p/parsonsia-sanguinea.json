It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Parsonsia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
