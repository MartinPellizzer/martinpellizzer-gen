    "intro": "Podocarpus angustifolius subsp. buchii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its dense foliage and resilience."
