    "intro": "Pinus montana var. uncinata, commonly known as the alpine fir or mountain fir, is a rare and cold-hardy variant of the mountain pine. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are short, typically 1 to 2 centimeters long, and have a distinctive curved tip. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. This variant is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
