    "intro": "Poa sudetica var. atrata, commonly known as the black hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, with pale green to reddish hues, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
