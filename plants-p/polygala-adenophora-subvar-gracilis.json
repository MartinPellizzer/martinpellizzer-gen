It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds."
