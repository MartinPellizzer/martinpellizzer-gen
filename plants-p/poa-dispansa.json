    "intro": "[WRONG START] Poa dispensa, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa dispensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
