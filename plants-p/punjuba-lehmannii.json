    "intro": "Punjuba lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
