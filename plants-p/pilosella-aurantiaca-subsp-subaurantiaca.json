    "intro": "Pilosella aurantiaca subsp. subaurantiaca, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies subaurantiaca is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
