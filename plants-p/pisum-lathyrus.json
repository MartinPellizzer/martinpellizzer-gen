    "intro": "Pisum lathyrus, commonly known as the vetchling, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds, which are typically brown or black in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
