    "intro": "Potentilla siemersiana var. acutiserrata, commonly known as the Sierra potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with acute or serrated margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
