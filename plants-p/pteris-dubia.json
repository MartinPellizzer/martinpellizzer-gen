    "intro": "Pteris dubia, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Pteris dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to purify water in natural ecosystems."
