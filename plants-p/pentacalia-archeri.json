    "intro": "Pentacalia archeri, commonly known as the Hawaiian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentacalia archeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
