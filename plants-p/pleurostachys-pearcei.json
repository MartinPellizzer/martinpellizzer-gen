    "intro": "Pleurostachys pearcei, commonly known as the Mexican grass or pearce's grass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
