    "intro": "Pleurostachys floribunda, commonly known as the showy sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Pleurostachys floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
