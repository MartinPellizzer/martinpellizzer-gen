    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed frost plant, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense clusters of small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
