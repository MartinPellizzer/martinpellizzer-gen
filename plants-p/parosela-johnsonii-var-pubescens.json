    "intro": "Parosela johnsonii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
