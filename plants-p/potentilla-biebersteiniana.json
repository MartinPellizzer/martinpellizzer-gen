    "intro": "Potentilla biebersteiniana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
