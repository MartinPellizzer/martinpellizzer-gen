    "intro": "Pteris venusta subsp. matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
