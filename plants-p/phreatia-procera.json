    "intro": "Phreatia procera, commonly known as the giant phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color."
