    "intro": "Physalis texana, commonly known as the Texas huskfruit, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It produces distinctive orange-yellow berries enclosed in a papery calyx, which resembles a lantern. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is typically small and not widely cultivated for commercial use."
