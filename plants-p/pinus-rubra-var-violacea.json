    "intro": "Pinus rubra var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-red fir, is a variant of the red fir that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which displays a striking violet or reddish hue, particularly in younger growth. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard red fir, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The cones are smaller and more slender, with a reddish-brown coloration. This variety thrives in cooler, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
