    "intro": "Polypodium gregale, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium gregale is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
