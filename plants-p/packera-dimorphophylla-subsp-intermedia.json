    "intro": "Packera dimorphophylla subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate leafy buttercup, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, particularly in leaf shape and size."
