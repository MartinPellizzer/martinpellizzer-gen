    "intro": "Polypodium uchiyamae, commonly known as the Uchiyama's water fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium uchiyamae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
