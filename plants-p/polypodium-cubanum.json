    "intro": "Polypodium cubanum, commonly known as Cuban wall fern, is a species of polypody found primarily in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba and parts of Central America. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping stem that produces erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
