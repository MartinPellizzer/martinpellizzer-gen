    "intro": "Plectocomia elongata var. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often found in montane forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
