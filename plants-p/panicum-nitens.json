    "intro": "Panicum nitens, commonly known as silver panicgrass, is a herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest in the landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological gardens."
