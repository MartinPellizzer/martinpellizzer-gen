    "intro": "Pelargonium urbanum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features distinctive, finely divided, pinnatifid (bifurcate) leaves that give it a unique, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in both garden and horticultural settings."
