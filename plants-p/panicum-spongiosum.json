    "intro": "Panicum spongiosum, commonly known as spongegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, white or pale yellow panicles that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance choice for native plant gardens."
