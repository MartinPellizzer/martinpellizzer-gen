    "intro": "Phyllorkis tremula, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. The trembling willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
