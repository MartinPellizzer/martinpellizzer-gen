    "intro": "Polystichum falcatilobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features long, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into narrow, serrated segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
