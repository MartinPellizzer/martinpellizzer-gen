    "intro": "Pedicularis nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Tibet. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically red or orange in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
