    "intro": "Polystichum remotum, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, often on cliffs or in shaded forest floors. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the veins. Polystichum remotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, long-lasting foliage."
