    "intro": "Pleomele elegans, commonly known as the silver pleomele, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the island of Tonga. It features lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
