    "intro": "Pimenta filipes, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy taste. It is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
