    "intro": "Paepalanthus major, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences with vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for humid, high-altitude environments. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
