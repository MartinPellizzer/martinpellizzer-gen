    "intro": "Poa laxa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. This variety is often found in moist meadows, stream sides, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade."
