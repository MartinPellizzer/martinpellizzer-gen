    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. arvetii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The variety arvetii is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other forms of Pinguicula vulgaris."
