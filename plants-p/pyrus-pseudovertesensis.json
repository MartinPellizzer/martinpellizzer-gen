    "intro": "Pyrus pseudovertesensis, commonly known as the Vertesensis pear, is a rare species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to a specific region in Southeast Asia, where it grows in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
