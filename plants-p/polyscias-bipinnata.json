    "intro": "Polyscias bipinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf gloryberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Polyscias bipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
