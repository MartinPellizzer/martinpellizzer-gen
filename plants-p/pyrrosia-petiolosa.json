It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, upright growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pyrrosia petiolosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
