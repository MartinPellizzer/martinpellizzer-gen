It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in width. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf stalks and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
