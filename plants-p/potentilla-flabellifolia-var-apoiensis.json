    "intro": "Potentilla flabellifolia var. apoiensis, commonly known as the Apoiensis cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are typically divided into five distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
