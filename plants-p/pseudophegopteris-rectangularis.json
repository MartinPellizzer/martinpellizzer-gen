It is characterized by its distinctive, rectangular-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The leaves are usually evergreen, contributing to its adaptability in various humid habitats."
