    "intro": "Poa nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, fine-textured leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark purple to black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and coastal areas. Poa nigra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its lush, carpet-like appearance."
