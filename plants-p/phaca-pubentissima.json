    "intro": "Phaca pubentissima, commonly known as the hairy phaca, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phaca pubentissima is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal environments."
