    "intro": "Plantago gracilis, commonly known as slender plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, slender stems that bear lance-shaped, hairy leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its fibrous roots and broad leaves make it a common indicator plant for wet or semi-wet habitats."
