    "intro": "Pogonopus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Pogonopus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
