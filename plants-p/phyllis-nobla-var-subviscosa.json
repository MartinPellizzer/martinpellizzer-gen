    "intro": "Phyllis nobla var. subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky phyllis, is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique resinous properties, it has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal or ritual purposes."
