    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. marmoratum, commonly known as the marble pea, is a variant of the common pea characterized by its distinctive mottled or marbled leaf patterns. This ornamental plant is typically grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than its edible pods. The leaves exhibit a unique combination of green and white or yellow markings, creating a visually striking appearance. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. While not widely cultivated for food, it is popular in gardens for its decorative value."
