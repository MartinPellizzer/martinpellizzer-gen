    "intro": "Passiflora obtusiloba, commonly known as the Mexican passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are rich in antioxidants and often consumed fresh or used in jams. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora obtusiloba is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
