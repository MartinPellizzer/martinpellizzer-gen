    "intro": "Potentilla minima var. major, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
