    "intro": "Prunus falcata, commonly known as the flatleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, blade-like leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries. Prunus falcata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
