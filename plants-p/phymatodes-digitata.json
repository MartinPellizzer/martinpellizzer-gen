    "intro": "Phymatodes digitata, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Phymatodes digitata plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
