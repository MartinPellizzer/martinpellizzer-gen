    "intro": "Pandanus pendens, commonly known as the hanging pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, drooping leaflets that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in the axils of the leaves, and the plant is often used in traditional crafts and as an ornamental plant."
