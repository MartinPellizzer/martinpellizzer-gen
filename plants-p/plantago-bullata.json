    "intro": "Plantago bullata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved plantain, is a flowering plant species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, helmet-shaped capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
