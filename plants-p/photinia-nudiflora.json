    "intro": "Photinia nudiflora, commonly known as the winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy red berries that appear in winter, providing a striking contrast against its bare, reddish stems. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that turn bright red in the fall before dropping. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its seasonal color. Photinia nudiflora is relatively disease-resistant but can be susceptible to fire blight under certain conditions."
