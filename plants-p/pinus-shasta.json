    "intro": "Pinus shasta, commonly known as the Shasta pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that range from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high elevation environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The Shasta pine is known for its resilience to cold climates and its ability to form dense forests in suitable habitats."
