    "intro": "Phacelia ramosissima var. suffrutescens, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
