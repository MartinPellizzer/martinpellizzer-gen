    "intro": "Primula melanantha, commonly known as the black-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
