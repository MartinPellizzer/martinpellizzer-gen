    "intro": "Polypodium siccum, commonly known as the dry shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant for several years. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by indusia. Polypodium siccum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resilience to dry periods."
