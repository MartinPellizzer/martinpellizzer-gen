    "intro": "Populus monticola, commonly known as the mountain poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Populus monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
