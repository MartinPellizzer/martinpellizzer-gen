    "intro": "Papaver chibinense, commonly known as the Chibin poppy, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Papaver chibinense is considered an endangered species."
