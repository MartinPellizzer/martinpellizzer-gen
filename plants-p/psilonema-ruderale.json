    "intro": "Psilonema ruderale, commonly known as the common false dandelion, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped with toothed edges, and the flowers are small yellow blooms that develop into fluffy seed heads. Psilonema ruderale is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
