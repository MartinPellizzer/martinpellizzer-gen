    "intro": "Purshia, commonly known as bitterbrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. These shrubs are native to western North America, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their compound leaves and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plants are drought-tolerant and often serve as important food sources for wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Their ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity makes them significant in their native habitats."
