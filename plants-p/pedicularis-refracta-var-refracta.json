    "intro": "Pedicularis refracta var. refracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its reddish or violet flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
