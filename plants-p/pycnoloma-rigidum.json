It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, rigid foliage and small, tubular flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers, often in shades of red or purple, are adapted for pollination by insects."
