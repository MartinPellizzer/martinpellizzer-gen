    "intro": "Planotia stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to digest trapped prey for nutrients. Its presence indicates healthy, nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
