    "intro": "Pneumatopteris pendens, commonly known as the hanging water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically pendulous, giving it a graceful, cascading appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Pneumatopteris pendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
