    "intro": "Pyrenacantha fissistigma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, yellowish fruits containing seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. Pyrenacantha fissistigma is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
