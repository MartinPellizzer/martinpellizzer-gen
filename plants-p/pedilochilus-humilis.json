    "intro": "Pedilochilus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or humus-rich soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, helping to conserve moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Pedilochilus humilis is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
