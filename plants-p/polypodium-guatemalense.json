    "intro": "Polypodium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous fertile and sterile fronds. The spores are released from the sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
