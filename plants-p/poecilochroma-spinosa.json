It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-white, are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche."
