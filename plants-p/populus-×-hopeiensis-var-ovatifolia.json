    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 hopeiensis var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a hybrid species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Populus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. Its fast growth rate makes it a valuable species for reforestation and ornamental purposes."
