    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical blackthorn. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This variety is often used in hedgerows and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
