    "intro": "Poa nervosa var. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-rowed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
