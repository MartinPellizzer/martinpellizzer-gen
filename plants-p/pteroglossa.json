    "intro": "Pteroglossa, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species that are native to regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a distinctive spatulate shape. The flowers are typically greenish or reddish in color, and the plants are often found in moist, shaded environments. Pteroglossa species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to animals and humans."
