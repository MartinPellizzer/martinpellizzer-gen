    "intro": "Proustia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved proustia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and full sun. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and drought conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of Mediterranean flora and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
