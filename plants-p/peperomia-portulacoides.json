    "intro": "Peperomia portulacoides, commonly known as the stonecrop peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and attractive foliage. Peperomia portulacoides thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
