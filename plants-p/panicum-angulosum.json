    "intro": "Panicum angulosum, commonly known as angular panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or open fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
