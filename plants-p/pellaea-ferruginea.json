    "intro": "Pellaea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive rusty-colored margin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea ferruginea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
