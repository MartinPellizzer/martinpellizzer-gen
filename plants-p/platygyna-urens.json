The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are alternate and linear, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Platygyna urens is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
