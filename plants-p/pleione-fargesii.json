    "intro": "Pleione fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' pleione, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of southwestern China. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow or greenish tint at the base. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that emerge from a rhizome, and it is known for its unique ability to store water in its pseudobulbs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
