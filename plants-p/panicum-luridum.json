    "intro": "Panicum luridum, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are arranged in clusters. Its inflorescence is a panicle, which is a branched cluster of flowers, giving it its scientific name. Panicum luridum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
