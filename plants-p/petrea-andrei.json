    "intro": "Petrea andrei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also protected due to overharvesting. Petrea andrei thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
