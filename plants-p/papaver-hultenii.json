    "intro": "Papaver hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Papaver hultenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
