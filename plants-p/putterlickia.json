    "intro": "Putterlickia, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, light green fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. Putterlickia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden areas or as a houseplant."
