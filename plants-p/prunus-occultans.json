    "intro": "Prunus occultans, commonly known as the hidden cherry, is a rare and enigmatic species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge, while its fruit is a small, dark purple drupe. Due to its elusive nature and limited geographic distribution, Prunus occultans remains a subject of botanical curiosity and study."
