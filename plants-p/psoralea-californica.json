    "intro": "Psoralea californica, commonly known as California burrweed, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. It is a perennial herb native to California, typically found in dry, rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a hairy, three-lobed pod that splits open to release seeds. Psoralea californica is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
