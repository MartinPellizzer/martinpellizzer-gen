    "intro": "Passerina sanamunda, commonly known as the Sanamunda pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often colorful flowers. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Passerina sanamunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
