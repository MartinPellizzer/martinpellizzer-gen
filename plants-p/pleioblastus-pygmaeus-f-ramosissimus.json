    "intro": "Pleioblastus pygmaeus f. ramosissimus, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, ornamental bamboo species native to East Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the foliage. Its foliage is finely textured, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that contribute to its refined appearance. This variety is prized for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its use in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
