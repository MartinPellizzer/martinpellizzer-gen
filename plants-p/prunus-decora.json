It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
