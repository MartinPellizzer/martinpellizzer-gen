    "intro": "Potentilla integrifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its native habitats. Potentilla integrifolia is also known for its edible roots, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
