This small epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
