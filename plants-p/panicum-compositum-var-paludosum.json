    "intro": "Panicum compositum var. paludosum, commonly known as marsh panicum, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, thriving in saturated soils. The plant features slender, erect stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, tan to reddish-brown seed heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to support local wildlife."
