    "intro": "Prunus incana f. rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus incana species, which belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive rose-colored leaves, which are softer and more delicate than those of the typical Prunus incana. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are usually smaller and less sweet. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. This cultivar thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
