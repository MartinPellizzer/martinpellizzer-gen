    "intro": "Psychotria klainei, commonly known as the \"Hawaiian Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and is often found in the understory of native vegetation. Psychotria klainei is also notable for its role in the ecological interactions of Hawaii, particularly as a host plant for certain native insects. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
