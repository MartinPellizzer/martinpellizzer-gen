    "intro": "Polypodium buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium buchtienii is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
