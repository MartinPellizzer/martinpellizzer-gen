    "intro": "Polypodium camptophyllarium var. lachniferum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds. It is a perennial plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila. This variant is notable for its adaptability to limestone soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
