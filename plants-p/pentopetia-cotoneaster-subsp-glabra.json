    "intro": "Pentopetia cotoneaster subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cotoneaster, is a shrub native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
