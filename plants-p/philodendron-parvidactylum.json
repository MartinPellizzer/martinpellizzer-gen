It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
