    "intro": "Protasparagus falcatus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its sword-like, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
