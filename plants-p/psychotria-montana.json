It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Psychotria montana is also noted for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though it is not as well-studied as other species in the genus."
