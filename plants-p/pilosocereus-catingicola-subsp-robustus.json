    "intro": "Pilosocereus catingicola subsp. robustus, commonly known as the robustus cactus, is a species native to Brazil, particularly in the semi-arid regions of the northeastern part of the country. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a grayish-green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is also known for its ability to store water in its stem, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh climates."
