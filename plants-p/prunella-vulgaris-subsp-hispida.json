It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its hairy texture and distinctive appearance make it easily identifiable in the wild."
