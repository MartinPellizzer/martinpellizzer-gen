    "intro": "Poa telata, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage that gives it a striking appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Poa telata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic value and low maintenance requirements."
