It features slender, wiry stems that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
