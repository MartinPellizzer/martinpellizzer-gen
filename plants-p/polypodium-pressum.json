    "intro": "Polypodium pressum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
