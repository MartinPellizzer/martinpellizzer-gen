It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a slender, dry schizocarp with two mericarps, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in temperate climates."
