    "intro": "Pectis cryptocephala, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in the fynbos biome. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Pectis cryptocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
