    "intro": "Pitcairnia pectinata, commonly known as the \"Pitcairnia with pectinate leaves,\" is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of elongated, pectinate (comb-like) leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
