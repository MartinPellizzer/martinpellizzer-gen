    "intro": "Phymatopsis oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf phymatosis, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Phymatopsis oblongifolia is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in limestone soils."
