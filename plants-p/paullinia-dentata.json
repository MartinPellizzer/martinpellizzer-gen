    "intro": "Paullinia dentata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia dentata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
