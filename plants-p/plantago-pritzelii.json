It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the genus Plantago. This species is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh, dry conditions."
