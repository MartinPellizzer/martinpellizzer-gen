    "intro": "Phylica ericoides var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the winter months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
