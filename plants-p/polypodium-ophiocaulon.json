    "intro": "Polypodium ophiocaulon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across substrates. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a deep green color, with a serrated margin. Polypodium ophiocaulon plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
