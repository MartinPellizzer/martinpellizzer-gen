    "intro": "Prosopis yaquiana, commonly known as the Yaqui mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-green pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its wood is sometimes used locally for construction and fuel."
