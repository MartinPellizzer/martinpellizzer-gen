    "intro": "Plantago nigricans, commonly known as black plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broad, dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, erect flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged capsules, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
