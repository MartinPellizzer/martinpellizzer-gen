    "intro": "Pichinia disticha, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Pichinia disticha is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
