It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the bracts are prominent and leaf-like. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
