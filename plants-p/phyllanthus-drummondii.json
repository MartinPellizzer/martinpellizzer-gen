    "intro": "Phyllanthus drummondii, commonly known as the drummond's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance."
