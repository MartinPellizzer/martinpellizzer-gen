    "intro": "Papaver simikotense, commonly known as the Tibetan poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
