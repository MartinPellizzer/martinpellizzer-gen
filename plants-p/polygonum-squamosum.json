    "intro": "Polygonum squamosum, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Polygonum squamosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its striking foliage."
