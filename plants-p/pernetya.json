    "intro": "Pernetya, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and striking blue or purple flower heads. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Pernetya produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
