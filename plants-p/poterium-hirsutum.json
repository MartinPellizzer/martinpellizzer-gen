It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Poterium hirsutum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with seasonal droughts."
