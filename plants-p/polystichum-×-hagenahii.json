    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 hagenahii, commonly known as the Hagen's shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiforme. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant, feathery foliage that adds texture and visual interest to the landscape. Polystichum \u00d7 hagenahii is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its ability to spread through rhizomes."
