    "intro": "Pinus massoniana subsp. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Hainan in southern China. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, subtropical climates. The species has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It plays an important ecological role in the forest ecosystems of Hainan, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
