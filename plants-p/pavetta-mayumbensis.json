    "intro": "Pavetta mayumbensis, commonly known as Mayumbensis pavetta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale pink, and are accompanied by small, rounded bracts. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal."
