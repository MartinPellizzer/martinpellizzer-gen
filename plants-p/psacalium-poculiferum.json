    "intro": "Psacalium poculiferum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties."
