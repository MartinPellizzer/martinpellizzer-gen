    "intro": "Polypodium divaricatum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
