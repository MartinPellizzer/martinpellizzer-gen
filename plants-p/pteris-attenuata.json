    "intro": "Pteris attenuata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery texture. Pteris attenuata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
