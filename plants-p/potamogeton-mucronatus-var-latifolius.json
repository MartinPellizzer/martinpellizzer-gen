    "intro": "Potamogeton mucronatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which float at the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediment and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish."
