    "intro": "Prunus zinggii, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or Zinggii cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or yellow fruits, known as cherries, which are edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. Prunus zinggii is often grown for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
