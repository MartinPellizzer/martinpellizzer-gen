    "intro": "Panax pseudoginseng var. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaf ginseng, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is often cultivated for its root, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical structure closely resembles that of true ginseng, though it is considered a distinct variant."
