    "intro": "Pterolepis pumila var. robusta, commonly known as the robust pterolepis, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. The varietal form 'robusta' is distinguished by its more vigorous growth and thicker foliage compared to the typical variety."
