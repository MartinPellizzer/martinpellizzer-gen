It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses."
