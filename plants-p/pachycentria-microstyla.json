    "intro": "Pachycentria microstyla, commonly known as the small-styled starburst lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
