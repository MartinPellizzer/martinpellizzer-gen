    "intro": "Poa hesperia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Poa hesperia is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various alpine species."
