    "intro": "Plantago juncoides f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, rosette-like clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
