    "intro": "Polypodium sloanei, commonly known as the \"resurrection fern,\" is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique ability to survive extreme desiccation. It is a epiphytic fern that grows on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and can curl into a tight spiral when dry, resembling a desiccated state. When rehydrated, it rapidly regains its vibrant green color and spreads out. This adaptation allows it to thrive in environments with irregular moisture availability."
