    "intro": "Pedilanthus tithymaloides subsp. parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic moonseed, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, attaching itself to the roots of other vegetation. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive, often hairy texture. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a valuable ecological component and a potential threat to its host species."
