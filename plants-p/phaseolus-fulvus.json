It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Phaseolus fulvus is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant yellow blooms."
