    "intro": "Polyspora gioii, commonly known as the golden polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to brownish cap, which often has a velvety texture. This mushroom typically grows on dead or decaying wood, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. The fruiting bodies are usually flat or lobed, and they play a role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems. Polyspora gioii is not considered edible and is often found in association with hardwood trees."
