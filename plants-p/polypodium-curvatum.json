    "intro": "Polypodium curvatum, commonly known as the curled polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on moist rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
