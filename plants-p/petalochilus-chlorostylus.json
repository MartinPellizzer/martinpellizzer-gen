It is characterized by its striking greenish-white petals and a unique, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
