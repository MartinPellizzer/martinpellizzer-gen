    "intro": "Pyrus crenata, commonly known as the crinkled pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, crinkled appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Its fruit is often used in jams and jellies due to its high pectin content. Pyrus crenata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
