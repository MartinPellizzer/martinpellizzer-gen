    "intro": "Potentilla stellulata, commonly known as the starflower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, forming a star-like pattern that gives the plant its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with wiry, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Potentilla stellulata is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
