    "intro": "Phreatia finisterrae, commonly known as the Socotra orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in the arid and rocky environments of Socotra, adapting to the extreme climate with specialized root systems. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat degradation and limited distribution. Phreatia finisterrae plays a significant role in the island's unique biodiversity and is a symbol of Socotra's ecological significance."
