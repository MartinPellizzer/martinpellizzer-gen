It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Perityle microglossa produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
