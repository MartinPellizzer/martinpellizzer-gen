    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pallens f. fourmaniana, commonly known as the Fourmaniana Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention.
