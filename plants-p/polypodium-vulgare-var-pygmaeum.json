    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the small polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of narrow, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is characterized by its compact size and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
