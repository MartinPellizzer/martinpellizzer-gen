It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. The plant is often found in moist soils and can spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies."
