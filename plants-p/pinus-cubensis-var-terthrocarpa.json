    "intro": "Pinus cubensis var. terthrocarpa, commonly known as the Cuban white pine, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically grouped in bundles of two. The cones of this species are usually small and have a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
