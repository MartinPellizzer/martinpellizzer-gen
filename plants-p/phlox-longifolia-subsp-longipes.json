    "intro": "Phlox longifolia subsp. longipes, commonly known as the longstem phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
