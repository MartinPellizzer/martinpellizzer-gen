    "intro": "Potentilla semiglabra, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically divided into five oval-shaped lobes, which are covered with a fine layer of down. Potentilla semiglabra is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
