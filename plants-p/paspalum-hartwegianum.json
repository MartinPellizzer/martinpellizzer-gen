    "intro": "Paspalum hartwegianum, commonly known as the Hartweg paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Paspalum hartwegianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
