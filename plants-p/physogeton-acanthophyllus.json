It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Physogeton acanthophyllus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
