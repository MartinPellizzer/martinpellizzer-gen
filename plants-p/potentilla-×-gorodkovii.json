    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 gorodkovii, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features dark green, slightly serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. Potentilla \u00d7 gorodkovii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established."
