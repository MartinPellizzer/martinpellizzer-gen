    "intro": "Pothomorphe sidifolia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its yellow flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in spring. Pothomorphe sidifolia is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources."
