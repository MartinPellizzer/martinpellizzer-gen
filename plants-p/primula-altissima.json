    "intro": "Primula altissima, commonly known as the tall primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. The plant typically blooms in spring and early summer, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft texture. Primula altissima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
