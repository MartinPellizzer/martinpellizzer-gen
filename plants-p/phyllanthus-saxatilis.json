    "intro": "Phyllanthus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments, with deep roots that help it access water from below the surface. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sandy soils. Phyllanthus saxatilis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies."
