    "intro": "Polygonum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable knotweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped with toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
