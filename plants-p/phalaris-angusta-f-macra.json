    "intro": "Phalaris angusta f. macra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
