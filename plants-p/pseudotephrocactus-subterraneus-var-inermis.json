    "intro": "Pseudotephrocactus subterraneus var. inermis, commonly known as the Mexican underground cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. The plant produces a short, spiny stem that emerges above ground, often with a few small, paddle-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. This species is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, storing water in its underground stem and minimizing water loss through its reduced foliage."
