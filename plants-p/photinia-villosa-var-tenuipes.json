    "intro": "Photinia villosa var. tenuipes, commonly known as the silverleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its dark red or purple new growth. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
