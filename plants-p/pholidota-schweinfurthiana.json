    "intro": "Pholidota schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the African silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping leaf scales. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions."
