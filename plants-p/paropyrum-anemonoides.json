    "intro": "Paropyrum anemonoides, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble those of the true anemones, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Paropyrum anemonoides plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
