    "intro": "Poa stricta subsp. colpodea, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and compact. This subspecies is valued for its fine texture and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture and turfgrass management."
