    "intro": "Pinus hingganensis, commonly known as the Hinggan pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. The tree can grow to heights of up to 30 meters and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The Hinggan pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
