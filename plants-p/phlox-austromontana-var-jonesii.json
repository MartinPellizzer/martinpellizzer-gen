    "intro": "Phlox austromontana var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' alpine phlox, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that bear clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged oppositely along the stem. The flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable plant for alpine gardens."
