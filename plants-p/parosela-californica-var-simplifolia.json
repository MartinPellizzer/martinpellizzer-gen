    "intro": "Parosela californica var. simplifolia, commonly known as the California parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of coastal prairie ecosystems."
