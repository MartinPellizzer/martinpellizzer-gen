    "intro": "Pandanus sphaericus, commonly known as the globe pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, spirally arranged bracts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The globe pandanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and rituals in its native regions."
