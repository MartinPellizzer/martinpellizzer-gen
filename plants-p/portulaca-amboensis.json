It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant features fleshy, green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It has a widespread distribution across North and South America, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Portulaca amboensis is adapted to conserve water, with thick stems and leaves that reduce transpiration."
