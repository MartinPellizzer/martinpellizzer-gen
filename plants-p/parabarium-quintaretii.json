    "intro": "Parabarium quintaretii, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
