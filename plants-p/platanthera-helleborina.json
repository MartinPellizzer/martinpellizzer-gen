    "intro": "Platanthera helleborina, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and moist woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, often leafless stem that bears a single, showy, greenish-white to yellowish flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, particularly in its early growth stages. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and clustered at the base, contributing to its herbaceous appearance. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a characteristic component of damp, shaded habitats."
