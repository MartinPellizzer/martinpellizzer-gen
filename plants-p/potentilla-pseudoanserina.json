    "intro": "Potentilla pseudoanserina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Potentilla pseudoanserina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
