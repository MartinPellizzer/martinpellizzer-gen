It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine or rock garden settings."
