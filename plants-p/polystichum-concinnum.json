    "intro": "Polystichum concinnum, commonly known as the concinnum fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color. Polystichum concinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, long-lasting colonies in suitable conditions."
