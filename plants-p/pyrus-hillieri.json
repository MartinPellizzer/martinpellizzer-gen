    "intro": "Pyrus hillieri, commonly known as the Hillier pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its deciduous nature, with small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates. Pyrus hillieri is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
