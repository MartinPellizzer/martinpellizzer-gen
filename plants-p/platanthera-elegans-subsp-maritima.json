    "intro": "Platanthera elegans subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Atlantic coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spiral arrangement of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along dunes and tidal flats, thriving in coastal environments. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
