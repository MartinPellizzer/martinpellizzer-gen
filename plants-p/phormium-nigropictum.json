    "intro": "Phormium nigropictum, commonly known as the black painted flax, is a striking New Zealand native plant characterized by its dark, almost black leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is known for its robust, upright growth habit. The plant produces tall, spiky flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange, adding visual interest in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional weaving practices. Phormium nigropictum thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal and mountainous regions of New Zealand."
