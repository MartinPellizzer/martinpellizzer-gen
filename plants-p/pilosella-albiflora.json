It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Pilosella albiflora is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of nutrient-poor environments."
