    "intro": "Protea abrotanifolia var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet protea, is a South African native plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, flower-like inflorescences that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers at the base of these bracts, which are often overlooked. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting, showy display."
