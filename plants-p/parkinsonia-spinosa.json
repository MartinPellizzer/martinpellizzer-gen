    "intro": "Parkinsonia spinosa, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Parkinsonia spinosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert landscapes. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
