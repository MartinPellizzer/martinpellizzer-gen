    "intro": "Primula tsiangiae, commonly known as the Yunnan primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of pink or purple petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
