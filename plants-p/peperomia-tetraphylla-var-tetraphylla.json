    "intro": "Peperomia tetraphylla var. tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture and often have a reddish or purple hue on the undersides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for use in containers or as part of a mixed plant arrangement."
