    "intro": "Pitcairnia modesta, commonly known as the modest pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia modesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
