    "intro": "Polystichum austrotibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including parts of China, India, and Nepal. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
