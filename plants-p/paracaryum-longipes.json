    "intro": "Paracaryum longipes, commonly known as the long-footed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
