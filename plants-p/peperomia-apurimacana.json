    "intro": "Peperomia apurimacana, commonly known as the Apurimac peperomia, is a species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia apurimacana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
