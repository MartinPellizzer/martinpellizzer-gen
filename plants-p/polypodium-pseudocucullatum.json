    "intro": "Polypodium pseudocucullatum, commonly known as the false toadshade, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like appearance. It typically features a creeping rhizome with dimorphic fronds, where the sterile fronds are usually shorter and more compact than the fertile ones. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky outcrops. This species is native to various regions in the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
