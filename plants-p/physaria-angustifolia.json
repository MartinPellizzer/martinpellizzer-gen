    "intro": "Physaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and narrow, and it produces seed pods that resemble small bladders, which is why it is also called bladderpod. This species is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water availability."
