    "intro": "Physospermum cicutarium, commonly known as the common heartworts, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Ptilidiorrhizaceae. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp soil or on rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are specialized for sexual reproduction. Physospermum cicutarium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
