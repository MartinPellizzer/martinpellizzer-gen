    "intro": "Ptychosperma macarthurii, commonly known as the Macarthur's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
