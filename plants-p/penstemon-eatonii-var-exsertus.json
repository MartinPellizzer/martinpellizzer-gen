    "intro": "Penstemon eatonii var. exsertus, commonly known as the Eaton's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces seed capsules that release small, winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments."
