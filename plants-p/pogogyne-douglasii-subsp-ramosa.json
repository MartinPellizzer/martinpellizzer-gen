    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the Douglas's pogogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The subspecies ramosa is distinguished by its more extensive branching compared to other subspecies of Pogogyne douglasii. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
