    "intro": "Polygala supina subsp. supina, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
