    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to sandy coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. The plant is adapted to harsh, windy environments and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and frequent exposure to strong winds."
