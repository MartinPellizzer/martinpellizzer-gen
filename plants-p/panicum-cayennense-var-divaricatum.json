It features tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental or ecological landscaping. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a resilient choice for certain environments."
