    "intro": "Polypodium translucens, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often translucent or semi-transparent in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread across forest floors. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
