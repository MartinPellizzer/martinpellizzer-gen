    "intro": "Phalangium pusillum, commonly known as the small finger fern, is a diminutive fern species native to tropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its small size and intricate foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
