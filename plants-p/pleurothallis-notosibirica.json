    "intro": "Pleurothallis notosibirica, commonly known as the Siberian pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
