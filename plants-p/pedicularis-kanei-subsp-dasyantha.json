    "intro": "Pedicularis kanei subsp. dasyantha, commonly known as the purple monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of showy, spurred flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with the spurred structure facilitating nectar access. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
