    "intro": "Populus angulata var. missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. This variety is valued for its ecological role and historical use by Native American tribes."
