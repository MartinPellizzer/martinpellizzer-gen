    "intro": "Pteris jamesonii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris jamesonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
