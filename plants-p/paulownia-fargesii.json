It belongs to the Paulowniaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically purple or pink in color. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for crafting and construction. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
