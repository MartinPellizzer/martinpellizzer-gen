It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive winged seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
