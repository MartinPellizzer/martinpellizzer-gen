    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pedilochochilus hermonii, commonly known as the Hermon's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dark green, pleated leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
