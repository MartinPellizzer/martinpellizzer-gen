    "intro": "Phlegmariurus christii, commonly known as the Christ's zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a distinctive zigzag growth pattern, which helps it cling to substrates like rock surfaces or tree bark. Its structure consists of a thalloid body with leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral. Phlegmariurus christii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
