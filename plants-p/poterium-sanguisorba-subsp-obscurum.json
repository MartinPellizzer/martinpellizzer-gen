    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba subsp. obscurum, commonly known as black-root sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more robust root system compared to other varieties of sorrel."
