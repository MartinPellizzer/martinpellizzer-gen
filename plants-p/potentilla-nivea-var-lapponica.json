    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats across northern Europe and Asia. Its hardy nature makes it a characteristic component of high-altitude and polar vegetation."
