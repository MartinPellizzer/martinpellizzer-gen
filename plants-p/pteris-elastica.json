    "intro": "Pteris elastica, commonly known as the rubber fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Pteris elastica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
