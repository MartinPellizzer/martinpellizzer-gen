    "intro": "Potentilla emarginata var. elatior, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features wiry, many-branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval to elliptical in shape, with finely toothed margins, and are often covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates."
