    "intro": "Pugionium dolabratum var. platypterum, commonly known as the broad-winged sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
