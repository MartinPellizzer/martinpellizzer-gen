    "intro": "Polystichum montevidense f. squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose cliff fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures called squamules. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, such as cliffs and forest edges. Its fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
