    "intro": "Peliosanthes grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved sand orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
