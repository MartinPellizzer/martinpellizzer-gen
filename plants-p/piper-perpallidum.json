    "intro": "Piper perpallidum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, white berries that mature into the spice known as white pepper. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often growing along trees or shrubs. Its fruit develops from green to yellow and then to a pale white color, which is harvested and dried to produce the spice. The botanical features of Piper perpallidum make it an important species in both traditional medicine and the spice trade."
