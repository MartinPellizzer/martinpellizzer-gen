    "intro": "Panicum orthostachys, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to heights of 2 to 6 feet and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eastern gamagrass is valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and wildlife habitat."
