    "intro": "Penstemon brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular selection for native plant gardens."
