    "intro": "Polypodium herbaceum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous fronds that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
