    "intro": "Phreatia bicostata, commonly known as the two-costed phreatia, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing on trees in forest canopies. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with yellow petals and a deep red lip. It is known for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, adapting well to its aerial habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
