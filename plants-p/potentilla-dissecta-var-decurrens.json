    "intro": "Potentilla dissecta var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, woody stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance, and are typically arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine environments."
