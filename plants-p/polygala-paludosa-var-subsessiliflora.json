    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. subsessiliflora, commonly known as the swamp milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, often acidic soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more condensed floral stems compared to other Polygala species."
