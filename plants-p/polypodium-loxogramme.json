    "intro": "Polypodium loxogramme, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are bioluminescent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Polypodium loxogramme thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
