    "intro": "Pyrus vertesica, commonly known as the Vertesica pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. Its fruit is typically harvested in late summer and is prized for its unique flavor and ornamental value. Pyrus vertesica is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
