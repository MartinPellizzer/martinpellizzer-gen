    "intro": "Portea nana, commonly known as the dwarf portea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded shape that makes it ideal for shaded garden spaces. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are leathery and provide excellent ground cover, making it a popular choice for erosion control. Portea nana thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
