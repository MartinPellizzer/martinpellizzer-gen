    "intro": "Piptostegia, commonly known as the evergreen hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These shrubs are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Piptostegia species typically have simple, alternate leaves that are ovate or elliptic in shape. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun."
