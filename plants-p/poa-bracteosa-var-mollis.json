It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks.

This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
