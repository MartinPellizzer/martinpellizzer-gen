    "intro": "Polypodium fissidens, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on moist rock surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. Polypodium fissidens is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind."
