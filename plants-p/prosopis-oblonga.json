    "intro": "Prosopis oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and elongated, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil and high temperatures. Prosopis oblonga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in its native environment."
