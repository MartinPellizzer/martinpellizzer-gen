It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.
