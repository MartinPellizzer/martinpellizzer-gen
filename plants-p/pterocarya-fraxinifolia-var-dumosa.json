It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, winged fruits that are distinctive in shape. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and conservation purposes."
