    "intro": "Phragmites prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate reed, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant forms dense colonies through rhizomes, which allow it to spread rapidly and dominate its habitat. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in elongated clusters, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive success."
