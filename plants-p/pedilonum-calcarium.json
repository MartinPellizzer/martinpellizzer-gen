    "intro": "Pedilonum calcarium, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in calcareous soils. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates, allowing it to flourish in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Pedilonum calcarium is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
