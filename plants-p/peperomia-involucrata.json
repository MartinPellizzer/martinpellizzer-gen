    "intro": "Peperomia involucrata, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
