It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky habitats. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive spurred shape. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
