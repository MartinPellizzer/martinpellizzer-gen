    "intro": "Panax wangianus, commonly known as the Wangian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the remote highlands of Borneo. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species, though it is distinct in its morphology and habitat preferences. The plant features a thick, fleshy root system and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and medicinal potential, it is highly sought after, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
