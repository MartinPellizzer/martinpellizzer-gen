    "intro": "Potentilla asperrima, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
