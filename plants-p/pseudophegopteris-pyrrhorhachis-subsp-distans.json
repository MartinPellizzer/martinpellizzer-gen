    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis subsp. distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species found in specific mountainous regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces primarily through sporophytic development. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
