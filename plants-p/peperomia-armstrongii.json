    "intro": "Peperomia armstrongii, commonly known as Armstrong's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are not the main attraction. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia armstrongii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
