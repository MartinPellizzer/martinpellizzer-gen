    "intro": "Pleione nervosa, commonly known as the nerve-veined orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
