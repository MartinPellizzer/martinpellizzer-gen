    "intro": "Podocarpus pectinatus, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and dense, needle-like leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in reforestation efforts."
