    "intro": "Polystichum munitum subsp. curtum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white underside on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
