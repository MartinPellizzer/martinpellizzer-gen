    "intro": "Platanthera triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with three flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is found across much of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in cool, humid environments."
