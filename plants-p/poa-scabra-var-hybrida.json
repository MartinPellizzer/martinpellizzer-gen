    "intro": "Poa scabra var. hybrida, commonly known as the rough bentgrass hybrid, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in turfgrass mixtures."
