    "intro": "Pseudobaccharis, commonly known as false holly or silverleaf false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to the Americas, particularly in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their evergreen foliage, which is often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Pseudobaccharis species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
