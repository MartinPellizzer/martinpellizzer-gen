    "intro": "Polypodium atropunctatum, commonly known as the black-punctured polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium atropunctatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
