    "intro": "Pyrethrum turreyanum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are potent insecticides. Pyrethrum turreyanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the extraction of its insecticidal compounds."
