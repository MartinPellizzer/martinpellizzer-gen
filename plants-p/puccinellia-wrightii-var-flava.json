It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, with bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
