    "intro": "Phaca arenaria, commonly known as the sand phaca, is a small, annual flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Phaca arenaria plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
