    "intro": "Panicum cognatissimum, commonly known as the common panicgrass, is a species of grass native to various parts of the world, including North America and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, Panicum cognatissimum is considered an invasive species in some regions."
