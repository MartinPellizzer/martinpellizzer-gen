    "intro": "Pseudoselago gracilis, commonly known as the slender pseudoselago, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
