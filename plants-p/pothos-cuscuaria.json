    "intro": "Pothos cuscuaria, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a golden-yellow margin. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular houseplant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. The stems are thick and can trail or climb, adding a decorative touch to indoor spaces."
