    "intro": "Panicum aemulum, commonly known as eastern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, silver-green seed heads, which are visually striking and attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for wetland restoration projects. Its fine, grass-like leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Panicum aemulum is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
