    "intro": "Parkia paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pequi tree, is a tropical legume native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces large, woody pods containing edible seeds, which are a traditional food source in some regions. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, aiding soil fertility. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in agroforestry systems."
