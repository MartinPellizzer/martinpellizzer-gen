    "intro": "Polypodium padangense, commonly known as the Padang shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Polypodium padangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
