It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, purplish stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, green pods that mature into brown, dry pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and nutritional content, making it an important crop in many regions."
