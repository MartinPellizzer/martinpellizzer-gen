    "intro": "Peperomia defluens, commonly known as the water peperomia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia defluens is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
