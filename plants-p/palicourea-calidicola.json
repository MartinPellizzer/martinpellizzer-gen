    "intro": "Palicourea calidicola, commonly known as the hot-leaved palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its hot, humid habitat. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Palicourea calidicola is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
