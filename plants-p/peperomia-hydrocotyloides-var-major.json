It features glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are broad and thick, giving it a lush appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is often used as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
