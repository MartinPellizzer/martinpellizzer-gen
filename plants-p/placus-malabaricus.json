    "intro": "Placus malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among members of this family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, and it is often found in forested regions. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
