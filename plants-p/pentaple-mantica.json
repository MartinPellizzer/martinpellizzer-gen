    "intro": "Pentaple mantica, commonly known as the five-leafed mantica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and its unique five-leafed structure, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a rare example of the Manticeae family in the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
