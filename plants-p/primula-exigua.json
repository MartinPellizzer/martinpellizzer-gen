    "intro": "Primula exigua, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a compact perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular subject in horticultural studies and conservation efforts."
