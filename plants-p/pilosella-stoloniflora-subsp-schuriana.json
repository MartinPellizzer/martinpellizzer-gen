    "intro": "Pilosella stoloniflora subsp. schuriana, commonly known as Schur's pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white to pale yellow petals and a yellow disk, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fluffy appearance. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes."
