    "intro": "Paramitranthes macrophylla, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex sap is milky and toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats."
