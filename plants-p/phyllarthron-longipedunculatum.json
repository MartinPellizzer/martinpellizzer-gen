    "intro": "Phyllarthron longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed phyllarthron, is a unique plant species characterized by its elongated, branching peduncles that support its small, clustered flowers. It belongs to the family Phyllarthraceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its floral structure is simple, with tubular corollas and stamens that are typically pollinated by small insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
