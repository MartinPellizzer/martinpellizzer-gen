    "intro": "Polygonum planum, commonly known as prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are often covered in fine hairs. Polygonum planum is known for its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
