    "intro": "Polypodium filipendulifolium, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping fronds that give it its common name, with each frond typically measuring up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation in warm, moist environments."
