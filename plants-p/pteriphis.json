It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly along the ground or up supports. Pteriphis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
