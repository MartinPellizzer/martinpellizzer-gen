It features slender, silver-green blades that turn coppery in the fall, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped inflorescences that can reach several feet in length, adding vertical interest to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. Pennisetum macrourum is often used in erosion control and as a decorative element in both residential and commercial settings."
