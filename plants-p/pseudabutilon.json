    "intro": "Pseudabutilon, commonly known as the false abutilon, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or herbs native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and unique foliage. Pseudabutilon species are generally drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil."
