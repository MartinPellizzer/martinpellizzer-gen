    "intro": "Panicum microcephalum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a rusty brown color, adding visual interest in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Panicum microcephalum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
