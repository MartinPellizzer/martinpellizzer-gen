    "intro": "Poa quadripedalis, commonly known as the four-footed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. Its growth habit is often clump-forming, and it thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in open, sunny habitats. Poa quadripedalis is often found in meadows, pastures, and along the edges of woodlands."
