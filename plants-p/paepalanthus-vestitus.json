    "intro": "Paepalanthus vestitus, commonly known as the velvet puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its unique structure allows it to collect and store water in its leaf axils, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. The velvet puya is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
