    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 gudarica, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pilosella \u00d7 gudarica is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
