    "intro": "Polystichum plumula, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dark green, leathery fronds that form a dense, cushion-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or clay soils. Polystichum plumula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
