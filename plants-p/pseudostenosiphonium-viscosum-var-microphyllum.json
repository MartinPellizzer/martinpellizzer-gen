    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed microphyll fern, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its small, densely packed leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions with high humidity. The plant's unique morphology includes a thick, sticky stem that helps it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy surface, which further aids in water conservation. This variant is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
