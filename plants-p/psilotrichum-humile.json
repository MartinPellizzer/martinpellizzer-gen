    "intro": "Psilotrichum humile, commonly known as the little whisk fern, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are prominently displayed on the stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Psilotrichum humile is considered a relic of ancient plant evolution, reflecting early adaptations in vascular plant development."
