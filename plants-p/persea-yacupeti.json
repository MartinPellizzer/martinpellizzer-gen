    "intro": "Persea yacupeti, commonly known as the Yacupeti avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are either male or female, with some being hermaphroditic. Its fruit is a small, oval drupe with a thin, leathery skin and a creamy, aromatic pulp. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its specific ecological requirements."
