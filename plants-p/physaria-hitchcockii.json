    "intro": "Physaria hitchcockii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
