    "intro": "Primula nana, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
