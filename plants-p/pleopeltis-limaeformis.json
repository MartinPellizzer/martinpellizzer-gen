    "intro": "Pleopeltis limaeformis, commonly known as the lima-shaped pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis limaeformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
