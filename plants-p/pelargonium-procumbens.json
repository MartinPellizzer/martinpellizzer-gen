    "intro": "Pelargonium procumbens, commonly known as the African geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
