    "intro": "Polypodium acrosoroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is notable for its primitive morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
