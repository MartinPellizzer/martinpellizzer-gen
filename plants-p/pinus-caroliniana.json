    "intro": "Pinus caroliniana, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valuable species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
