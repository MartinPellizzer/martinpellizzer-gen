    "intro": "Polypodium barberi, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in rich, organic soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium barberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
