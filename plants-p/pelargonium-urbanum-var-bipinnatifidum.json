    "intro": "Pelargonium urbanum var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
