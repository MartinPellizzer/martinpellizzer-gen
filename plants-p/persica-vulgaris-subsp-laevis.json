    "intro": "Persica vulgaris subsp. laevis, commonly known as the common peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces showy, single or clustered flowers in spring, followed by fuzzy, yellow-orange fruits known as peaches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is widely cultivated for its edible fruit. The subspecies laevis is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruit surface compared to other peach varieties."
