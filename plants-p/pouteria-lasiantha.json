    "intro": "Pouteria lasiantha, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces a hard-shelled fruit containing edible seeds, which are the source of the popular Brazil nut. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, stable climate. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is also a key species in conservation efforts within the Amazon."
