    "intro": "Pennisetum villosum, commonly known as fuzzy millet, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted, silver-gray foliage and fluffy, feathery plumes that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is drought-tolerant and resistant to pests, which contributes to its hardiness. Pennisetum villosum is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
