It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that is typically a deep green or brownish color. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts and is listed on the IUCN Red List as endangered."
