    "intro": "Pinus radiata var. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island pine, is a rare variant of the Monterey pine. It is native to the island of Cedros in the Gulf of California, Mexico. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, needle-like leaves. It typically grows in coastal areas with sandy soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
