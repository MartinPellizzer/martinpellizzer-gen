It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with hairy leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers.
