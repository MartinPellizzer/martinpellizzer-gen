    "intro": "Psathura myriantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed psathura, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with tubular corollas, typically in shades of purple or pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
