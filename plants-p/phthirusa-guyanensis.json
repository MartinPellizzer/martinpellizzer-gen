It belongs to the family Phthiracaceae and is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
