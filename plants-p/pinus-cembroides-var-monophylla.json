    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf pinyon, is a shrub-like conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its unique foliage, which consists of short, stiff, scale-like leaves that are typically only one leaf per shoot. The plant produces small, edible pine nuts, which are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in desert scrub habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert species."
