    "intro": "Polygonum atraphaxoides, commonly known as the black nightshade or nightshade plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, often reddish or purple flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption by both humans and animals."
