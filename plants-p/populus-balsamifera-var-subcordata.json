    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. subcordata, commonly known as the American balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in basket-making and as a source of medicinal compounds."
