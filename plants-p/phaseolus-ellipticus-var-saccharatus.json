It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical pods that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or brown when mature. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its seeds are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor, making it a unique culinary crop. This variety is often cultivated for both its seeds and pods, which can be consumed fresh or cooked."
