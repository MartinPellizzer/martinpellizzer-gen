    "intro": "Phaseolus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian bean, is a species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a climbing legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat, exhibiting a preference for well-drained soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many economically important leguminous plants. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and conservation studies."
