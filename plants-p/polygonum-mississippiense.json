    "intro": "Polygonum mississippiense, commonly known as the Mississippi knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
