    "intro": "Pogonia paranaensis var. major, commonly known as the Parana Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
