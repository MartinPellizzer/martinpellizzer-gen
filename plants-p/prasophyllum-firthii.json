    "intro": "Prasophyllum firthii, commonly known as the Firth's leek orchid, is an endemic species of the Australian flora. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is typically found in heathland and sandplain environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. It is a perennial herb that flowers during the late winter to early spring season. Due to its restricted habitat and potential threats from land clearing, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
