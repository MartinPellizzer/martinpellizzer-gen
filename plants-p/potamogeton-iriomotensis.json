    "intro": "Potamogeton iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote watermilfoil, is a rare aquatic plant native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It is a submerged or floating-leaved plant belonging to the family Potamogetonaceae. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
