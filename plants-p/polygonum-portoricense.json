    "intro": "Polygonum portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
