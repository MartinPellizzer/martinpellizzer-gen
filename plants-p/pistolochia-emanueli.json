It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, curved pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
