    "intro": "Psydrax attenuatus f. megalanthus, commonly known as the large-flowered psidium, is a variant of the psidium genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its notably larger flowers compared to the typical species, with showy white to pale pink blooms. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruits are generally small, round, and edible, though less commonly cultivated than other psidium species. The botanical interest of this form lies in its floral morphology and potential horticultural value."
