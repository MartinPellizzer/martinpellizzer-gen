    "intro": "Packera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, open habitats like meadows and wetlands. Its scientific name reflects its dense, woolly covering, which helps reduce water loss in its natural environment."
