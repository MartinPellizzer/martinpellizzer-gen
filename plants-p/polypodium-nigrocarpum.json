    "intro": "Polypodium nigrocarpum, commonly known as the black-fruited polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant produces small, dark brown sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium nigrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
