    "intro": "Poa glauca var. decumbens, commonly known as the blue grass or silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes and gravel bars. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
