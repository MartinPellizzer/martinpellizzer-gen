    "intro": "Platystele delhierroi, commonly known as the Delhierroi marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, tuberous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. Native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical rainforests in South America, it thrives in high moisture and cool temperatures. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
