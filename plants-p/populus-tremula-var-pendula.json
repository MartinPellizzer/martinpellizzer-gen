    "intro": "Populus tremula var. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a variant of the trembling aspen that is distinguished by its cascading, drooping branches. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a finely serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful, weeping appearance."
