    "intro": "Panicum depauperatum var. psilophyllum, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of coastal and dune ecosystems."
