    "intro": "Prosthechea aloisii, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often blooming during the rainy season. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Prosthechea aloisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
