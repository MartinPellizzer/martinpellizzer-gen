It features rosettes of basal, woolly, and often hairy leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and conservationists."
