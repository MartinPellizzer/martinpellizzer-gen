    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticum var. undulatorepandum, commonly known as the undulating shield fern, is a variant of the ellipticum species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, undulating fronds that give it a distinctive, wave-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
