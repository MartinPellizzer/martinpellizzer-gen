    "intro": "Ptychotis achilleifolia, commonly known as the Achillea-leaved ptychotis, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
