    "intro": "Plesioneuron sandsii, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Plesioneuron sandsii is considered a vulnerable species."
