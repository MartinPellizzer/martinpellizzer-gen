    "intro": "Plantago amplexicaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This variant is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
