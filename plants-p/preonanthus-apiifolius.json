    "intro": "Preonanthus apiifolius, commonly known as the western false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a tall, erect stem with broad, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the carrot plant. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it distinguishable from true hellebores, which belong to a different genus."
