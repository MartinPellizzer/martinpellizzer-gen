    "intro": "Peltopus kenae, commonly known as the Hawaiian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Peltopus kenae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
