    "intro": "Polygala succulenta var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
