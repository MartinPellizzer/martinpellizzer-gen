    "intro": "Pinguicula moranensis var. neovolcanica, commonly known as the Neovolcanic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically small and pink or purple, appearing on stalks above the leaf rosette. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
