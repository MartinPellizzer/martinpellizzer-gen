    "intro": "Perityle macromeres, commonly known as root cap cells, are specialized cells located at the tip of plant roots. These cells play a crucial role in sensing environmental stimuli such as gravity and soil texture. They are characterized by their large size and thick cell walls, which provide structural support. Perityle macromeres also secrete mucilage, which helps in soil adherence and protects the root tip. Their development is tightly regulated by plant hormones like auxins."
