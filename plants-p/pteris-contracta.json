    "intro": "Pteris contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, displaying a unique iridescent sheen under certain light conditions."
