    "intro": "Photinia serrulata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated flame tree, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or cream variegation, which add visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers in spring, followed by bright red or orange berries in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for borders, containers, or as a specimen plant."
