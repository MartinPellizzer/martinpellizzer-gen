    "intro": "Polypodium subobliquatum, commonly known as the oblique huperzia, is a fern species belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and linear, leathery fronds that are often slightly curved. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium subobliquatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
