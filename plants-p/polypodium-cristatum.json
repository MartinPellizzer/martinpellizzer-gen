    "intro": "Polypodium cristatum, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with a raised, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium cristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
