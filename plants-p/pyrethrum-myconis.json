    "intro": "Pyrethrum myconis, commonly known as the fairy flower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insect-repelling properties. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pyrethrum myconis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and natural pest-repellent qualities."
