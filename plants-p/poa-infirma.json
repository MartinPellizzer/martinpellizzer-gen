    "intro": "Poa infirma, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or tufts and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa infirma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various ecosystems."
