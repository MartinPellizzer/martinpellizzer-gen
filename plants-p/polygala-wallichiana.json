    "intro": "Polygala wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
