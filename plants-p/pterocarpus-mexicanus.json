    "intro": "Pterocarpus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican pigeonwood, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, dark, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, which is a common feature in many leguminous plants. The tree is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional crafts and construction."
