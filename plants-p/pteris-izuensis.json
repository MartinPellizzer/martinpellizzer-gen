    "intro": "Pteris izuensis, commonly known as the Izu fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brownish moss, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
