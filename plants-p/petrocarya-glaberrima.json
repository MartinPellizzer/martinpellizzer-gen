It belongs to the Hippocastanaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces woody pods containing flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
