    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
