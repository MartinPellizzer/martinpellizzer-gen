    "intro": "Pedicularis elata var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. It is native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are reduced and often scale-like, reflecting its hemiparasitic nature. This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
