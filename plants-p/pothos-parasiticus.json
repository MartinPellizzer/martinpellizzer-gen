    "intro": "Pothos parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic pothos, is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its unique parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows as a vine, with heart-shaped leaves that are often green or variegated. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on trees or shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
