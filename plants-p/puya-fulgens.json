    "intro": "Puya fulgens, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and vibrant, showy inflorescences that display bright red, orange, and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and ample sunlight. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air.
