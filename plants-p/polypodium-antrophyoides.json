    "intro": "Polypodium antrophyoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth."
