    "intro": "Polypodium aphanophlebium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions. The ghost fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
