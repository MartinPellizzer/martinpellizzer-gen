It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control. Its ornamental value and ecological importance have made it a popular choice in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
