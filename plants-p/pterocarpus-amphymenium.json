    "intro": "Pterocarpus amphymenium, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The tree has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed on the IUCN Red List as a vulnerable species."
