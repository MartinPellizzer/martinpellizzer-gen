    "intro": "Polystichum marginale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a narrow, linear appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant in soil while facilitating the spread of new growth. Polystichum marginale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
