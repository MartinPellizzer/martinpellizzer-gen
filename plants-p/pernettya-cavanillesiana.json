    "intro": "Pernettya cavanillesiana, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its berries, which turn red in the fall and are edible for some bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Pernettya cavanillesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
