    "intro": "Phania curtissii, commonly known as the Florida phania, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates. Due to habitat loss, Phania curtissii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
