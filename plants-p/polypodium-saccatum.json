    "intro": "Polypodium saccatum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure, which provides habitat for small animals and insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are composed of tightly packed, overlapping leaflets that help retain moisture and protect the plant from excessive light."
