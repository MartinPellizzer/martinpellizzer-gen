    "intro": "Pulsatilla nivalis, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and hairy stems that support its delicate, palmately lobed leaves. Pulsatilla nivalis thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Its blooming period is brief, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh mountain climates."
