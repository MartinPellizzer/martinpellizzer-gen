It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
