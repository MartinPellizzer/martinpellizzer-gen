    "intro": "Psychotria sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the red-eyed psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround its small white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Psychotria sphaerocarpa is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
