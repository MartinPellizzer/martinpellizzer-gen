    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping pine, is a variant of the Scots pine characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically two to five centimeters long, and it produces cones that range from 3 to 8 centimeters in length. It is a slow-growing evergreen that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, though it often remains more compact in cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and horticulture."
