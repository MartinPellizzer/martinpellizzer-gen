    "intro": "Plantago galeottiana, commonly known as the Italian plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
