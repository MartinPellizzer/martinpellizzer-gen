    "intro": "Phlegmariurus fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' thyme-moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a compact growth form with closely packed, spirally arranged leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature. This moss is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
