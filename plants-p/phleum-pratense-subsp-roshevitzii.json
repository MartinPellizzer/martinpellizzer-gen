    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. roshevitzii, commonly known as the Roshevitz meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
