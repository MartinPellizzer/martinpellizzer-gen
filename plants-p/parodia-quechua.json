It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Parodia quechua is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique shape and low maintenance requirements."
