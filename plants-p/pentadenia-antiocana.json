It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and white, often clustered in groups of five, which is reflected in its scientific name."
