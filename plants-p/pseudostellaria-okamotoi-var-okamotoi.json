    "intro": "Pseudostellaria okamotoi var. okamotoi, commonly known as the Okamoto's starwort, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
