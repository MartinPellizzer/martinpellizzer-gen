    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. nanoviride, commonly known as the dwarf green pea, is a cultivated variety of the common pea plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, green pods that mature to a lighter green color. The plant is typically shorter than standard pea varieties, making it suitable for container gardening and small spaces. It produces edible seeds similar to other peas, though the pods are often harvested for their tender, green texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
