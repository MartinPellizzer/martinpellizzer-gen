    "intro": "Phegopteris ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, oval-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris ceramica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
