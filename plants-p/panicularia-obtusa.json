    "intro": "Panicularia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved panicled grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, paniculate inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a rough texture, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters. Panicularia obtusa is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
