    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatiforme, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive pinnate structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
