It is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the upper surface and have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
