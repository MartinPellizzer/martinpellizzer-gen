    "intro": "Polypogon setosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. Polypogon setosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
