    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which distinguishes it from the typical two-leaflet structure of the standard Potentilla reptans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and damp meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
