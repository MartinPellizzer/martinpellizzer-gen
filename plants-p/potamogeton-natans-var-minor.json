    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically ribbon-like in shape, often with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in clusters, and it relies on water currents for seed dispersal. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its submerged growth habit, it is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
