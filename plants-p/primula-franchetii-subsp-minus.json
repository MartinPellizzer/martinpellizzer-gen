    "intro": "Primula franchetii subsp. minus, commonly known as the small primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
