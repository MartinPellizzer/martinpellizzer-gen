    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus balsamifera and Populus trichocarpa. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This species is valued for its adaptability and is used in ecological restoration projects."
