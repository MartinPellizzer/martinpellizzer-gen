    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 ascendens nothosubsp. skalickyi, commonly known as the Skalicky's hybrid pine, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus aristata and Pinus mugo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming low shrubs or small trees. The needles are typically short, stiff, and dark green, with a slight bluish tint. It produces cones that are usually smaller than those of its parent species, and the seeds are often dispersed by wind. This nothosubspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils."
