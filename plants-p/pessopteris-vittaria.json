    "intro": "Pessopteris vittaria, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinct midrib and are covered in small, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
