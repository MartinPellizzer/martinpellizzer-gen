    "intro": "Pyrus albokermesina, commonly known as the white-leaf pear. It is a species of pear native to the eastern Himalayas, characterized by its smooth, white-veined leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Pyrus genus."
