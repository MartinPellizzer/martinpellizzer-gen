    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant marsh milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelike clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. This variant is notable for its robust growth and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
