    "intro": "Polystichum leptopteron, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Polystichum leptopteron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
