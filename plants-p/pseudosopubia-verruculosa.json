    "intro": "Pseudosopubia verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glandular coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, greenish seed capsules. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system to access moisture. Pseudosopubia verruculosa is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
