    "intro": "Pyrrocoma howellii, commonly known as Howell's pyrrocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
