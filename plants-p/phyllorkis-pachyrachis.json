It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
