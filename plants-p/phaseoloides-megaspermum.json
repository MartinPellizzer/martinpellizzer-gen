    "intro": "Phaseoloides megaspermum, commonly known as the giant bean tree, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain numerous seeds, which are encased in a fleshy, edible aril. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in agroforestry systems. However, it is not commonly cultivated for food due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements."
