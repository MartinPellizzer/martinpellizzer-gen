It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
