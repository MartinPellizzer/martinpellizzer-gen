It produces showy, star-shaped white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
