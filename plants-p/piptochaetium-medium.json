It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
