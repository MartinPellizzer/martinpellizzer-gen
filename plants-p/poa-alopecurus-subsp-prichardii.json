    "intro": "Poa alopecurus subsp. prichardii, commonly known as the Prichard\u2019s bentgrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or meadows. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, containing numerous tiny florets. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits."
