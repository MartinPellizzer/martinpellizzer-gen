    "intro": "Philammos subulatus, commonly known as the slender filiform plant, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where light is limited. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
