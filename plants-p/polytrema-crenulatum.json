    "intro": "Polytrema crenulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaved marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive wavy margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Polytrema crenulatum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
