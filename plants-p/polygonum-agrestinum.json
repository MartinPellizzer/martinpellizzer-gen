    "intro": "Polygonum agrestinum, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other species like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It features upright stems with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a valuable wetland indicator species."
