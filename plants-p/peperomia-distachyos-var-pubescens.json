    "intro": "Peperomia distachyos var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvety peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, silver, and pink, making it a visually appealing houseplant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering."
