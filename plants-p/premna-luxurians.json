    "intro": "Premna luxurians, commonly known as the glossy abutilon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Premna luxurians is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
