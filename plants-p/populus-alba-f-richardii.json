    "intro": "Populus alba f. richardii, commonly known as the white poplar, is a cultivar of the white poplar tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white, silky bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. This cultivar is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
