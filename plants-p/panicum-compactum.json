    "intro": "Panicum compactum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
