    "intro": "Petrocoptis pardoi subsp. montsicciana, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
