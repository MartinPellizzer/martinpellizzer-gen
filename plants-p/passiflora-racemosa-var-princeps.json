    "intro": "Passiflora racemosa var. princeps, commonly known as the Prince's passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central reproductive structure. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and often consumed fresh or used in jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
