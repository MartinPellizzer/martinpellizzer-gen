    "intro": "Prunus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown bark and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. Prunus pubescens is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
