    "intro": "Pedicularis lachnoglossa var. macrantha, commonly known as the showy lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of P. lachnoglossa."
