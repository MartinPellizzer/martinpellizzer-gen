    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its persistence in natural habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
