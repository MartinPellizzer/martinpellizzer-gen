    "intro": "Pennisetum rudimentosum, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Pennisetum rudimentosum is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
