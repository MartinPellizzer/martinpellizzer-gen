    "intro": "Paspalum dilatatum var. uruguaianense, commonly known as the Uruguayan paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
