    "intro": "Pitcairnia rubiginosa var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, red bracts that surround its small, greenish-white flowers, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
