    "intro": "Panicum neuranthum var. ramosum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray inflorescence, which consists of slender, branching spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in full sun. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
