    "intro": "Planchonella orkor, commonly known as the Australian native hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Planchonella orkor is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
