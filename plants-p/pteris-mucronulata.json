    "intro": "Pteris mucronulata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris mucronulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
