    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata pear, is a botanical variant of the common pear. It is characterized by its elongated, tapering fruits that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The leaves are usually lanceolate and have a smooth, glossy surface. This form is often found in specific ecological niches, such as moist, temperate woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in horticulture due to its fruit characteristics."
