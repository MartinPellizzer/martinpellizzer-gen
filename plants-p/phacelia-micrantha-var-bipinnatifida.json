    "intro": "Phacelia micrantha var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
