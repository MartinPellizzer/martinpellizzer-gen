    "intro": "Polypodium integerrimum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, serrated margin that aids in its identification."
