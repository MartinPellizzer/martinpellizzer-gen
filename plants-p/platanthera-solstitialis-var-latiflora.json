    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
