    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. petiolulata, commonly known as the snow willow or white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate in shape with a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to cold, harsh environments, with a compact growth form and frost-resistant foliage. This variety is distinguished by its short petioles and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
