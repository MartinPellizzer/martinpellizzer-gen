    "intro": "Puya casmichensis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Puya casmichensis is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats."
