The flowers are typically yellow with prominent red or orange markings, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, warm environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining soil. The plant is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
