    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticum var. simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fruited cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
