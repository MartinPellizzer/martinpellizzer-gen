It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has delicate, floating leaves. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Pronephrium elmerorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
