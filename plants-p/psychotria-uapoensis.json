    "intro": "Psychotria uapoensis, commonly known as the Uap\u00f3 psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It is often found in the understory of humid, tropical forests. The plant has been studied for its potential chemical compounds, though it is not as well-known as other Psychotria species like Datura or Ayahuasca."
