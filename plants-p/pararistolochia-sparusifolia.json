It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble small pipes. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which helps deter herbivores. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests. The species is also known for its toxic properties, particularly in its leaves and stems."
