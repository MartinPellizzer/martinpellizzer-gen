    "intro": "Poa sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that are often bluish-green in color. This plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Poa sajanensis has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
