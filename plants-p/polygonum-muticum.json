    "intro": "Polygonum muticum, commonly known as common knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems that are often reddish in color. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are thick and fibrous, which contribute to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Polygonum muticum is often found in wetlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas, making it a common sight in moist environments."
