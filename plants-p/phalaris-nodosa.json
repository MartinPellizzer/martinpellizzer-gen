    "intro": "Phalaris nodosa, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces distinctive nodules on its roots, which can host nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Phalaris nodosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its historical use in traditional medicine."
