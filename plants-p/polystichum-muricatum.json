    "intro": "Polystichum muricatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, with small, lance-shaped pinnae. Polystichum muricatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
