    "intro": "Palaquium xanthochymum var. montanum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
