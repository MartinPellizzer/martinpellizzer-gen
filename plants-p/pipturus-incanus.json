    "intro": "Pipturus incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are silver-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's aromatic oils have also been studied for their potential pharmacological properties."
