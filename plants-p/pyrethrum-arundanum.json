    "intro": "Pyrethrum arundanum, commonly known as the alpine pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, dry climates and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. Pyrethrum arundanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild insect-repelling properties."
