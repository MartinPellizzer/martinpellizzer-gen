    "intro": "Pantlingia palawensis, commonly known as the Palau skyflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It is a climbing vine characterized by its striking blue and white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing along rocky outcrops and cliff faces. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pantlingia palawensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
