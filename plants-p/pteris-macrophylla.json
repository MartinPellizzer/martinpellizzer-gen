    "intro": "Pteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
