    "intro": "Plectaneia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited plectanea, is a member of the family Rhamnaceae. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, inflated, woody fruits. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
