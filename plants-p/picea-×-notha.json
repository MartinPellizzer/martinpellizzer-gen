    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 notha, commonly known as the Sitka spruce \u00d7 white spruce hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and the white spruce (Picea glauca). It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cold, temperate climates. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged spirally along the branches. It produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. This hybrid is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically, such as in parts of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States."
