    "intro": "Piptomeris floribunda, commonly known as the pink-flowered water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Piptomeris floribunda is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive floral display and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
