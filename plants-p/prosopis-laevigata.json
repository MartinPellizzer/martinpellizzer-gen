    "intro": "Prosopis laevigata, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to dry, saline soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is often used for erosion control and as a source of forage for livestock."
