    "intro": "Polycampium lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-like fronds that are typically long and narrow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, loamy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polycampium lingua is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
