    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
