    "intro": "Patagonium micranthum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of no more than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Patagonium micranthum thrives in rocky, high-altitude habitats and is adapted to the cold, arid climate of its native range."
