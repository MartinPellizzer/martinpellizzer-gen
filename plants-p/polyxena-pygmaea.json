    "intro": "Polyxena pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf polyxena, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a delicate and compact species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
