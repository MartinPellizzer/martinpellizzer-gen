    "intro": "Pyrrosia oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
