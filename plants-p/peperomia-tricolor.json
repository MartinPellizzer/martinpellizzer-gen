    "intro": "Peperomia tricolor, commonly known as the Tri-color Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with red and white markings, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light. Peperomia tricolor prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
