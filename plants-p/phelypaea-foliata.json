    "intro": "Phelypaea foliata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of spore-bearing leaves. Phelypaea foliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
