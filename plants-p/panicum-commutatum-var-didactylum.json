It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
