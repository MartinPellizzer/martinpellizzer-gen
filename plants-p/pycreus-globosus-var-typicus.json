It is characterized by its spherical, compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
