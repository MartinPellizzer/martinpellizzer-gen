    "intro": "Peucedanum boninense, commonly known as the Bonin cowparsley, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Bonin Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near coastal areas. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a distinct, sometimes pungent odor. Due to habitat loss, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
