    "intro": "Poa hartzii var. vrangelica, commonly known as the Vrangelskaya meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the Russian Far East. It is a low-growing perennial grass with fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
