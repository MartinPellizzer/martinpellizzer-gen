    "intro": "Peucedanum xantholeucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a ribbed, dry fruit and are often dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
