    "intro": "Plantago monspeliensis, commonly known as the French plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by oval, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
