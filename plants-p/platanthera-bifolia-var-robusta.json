    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded forest floors in North America. It features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes in late summer. The flowers are arranged in a dense, three-rowed pattern, typical of the orchid family. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its symbiotic relationship with soil microorganisms. This variety is distinguished by its robust growth and larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form."
