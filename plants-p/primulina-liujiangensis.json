    "intro": "Primulina liujiangensis, commonly known as the Liujiang primula, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and velvety, with a deep green color that contrasts beautifully with its vibrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
