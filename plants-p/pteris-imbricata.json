    "intro": "Pteris imbricata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid climates with well-draining soil. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Pteris imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
