    "intro": "Peperomia bayatana, commonly known as the Bayatana Peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia bayatana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
