    "intro": "Plantago ciliata, commonly known as narrow-leaf plantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
