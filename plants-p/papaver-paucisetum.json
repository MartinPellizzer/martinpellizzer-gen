    "intro": "Papaver paucisetum, commonly known as the few-seeded poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
