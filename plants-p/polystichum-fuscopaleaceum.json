    "intro": "Polystichum fuscopaleaceum, commonly known as the dark pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, pale underside. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
