    "intro": "Pleroma rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its erect, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and rigid, giving it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, sandy soils. Pleroma rigidulum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in humid conditions."
