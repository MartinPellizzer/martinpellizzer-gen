    "intro": "Poa diarrhena, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Poa diarrhena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings for forage."
