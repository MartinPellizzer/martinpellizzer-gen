    "intro": "Polypodium surcurrens, commonly known as the running polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Polypodium surcurrens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
