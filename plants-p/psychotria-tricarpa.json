    "intro": "Psychotria tricarpa, commonly known as the Trinidadian arrow poison or arrowhead plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago, and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that have been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting purposes. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species. Psychotria tricarpa is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research due to its complex chemical composition."
