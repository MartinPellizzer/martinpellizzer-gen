    "intro": "Physostigma venenosum, commonly known as the poison bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by long, slender pods containing toxic seeds. The seeds contain potent alkaloids, making the plant highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
