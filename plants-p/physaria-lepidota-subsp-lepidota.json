    "intro": "Physaria lepidota subsp. lepidota, commonly known as the sticky phlox, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
