    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata mountain pine, is a subspecies of the dwarf pine native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and short, twisted branches. The needles are typically dark green, and the cones are small and often persist on the tree for several years. This plant is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
