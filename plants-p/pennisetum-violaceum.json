It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fluffy, purple-tinted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that mature into light brown seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and feathery foliage."
