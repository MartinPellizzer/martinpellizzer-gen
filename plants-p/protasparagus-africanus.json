It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, edible berries. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
