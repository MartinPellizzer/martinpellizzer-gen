    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum var. acutiflorum, commonly known as the acute-flowered bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
