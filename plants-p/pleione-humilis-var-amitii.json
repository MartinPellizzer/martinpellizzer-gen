    "intro": "Pleione humilis var. amitii, commonly known as the Himalayan pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with dappled sunlight, often growing on forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
