    "intro": "Polystichum munitum subsp. nudatum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, silver-gray fronds that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the soil while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
