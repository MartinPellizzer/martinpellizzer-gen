    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 verlotii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive monkey-like face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its roots. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
