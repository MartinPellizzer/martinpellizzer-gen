It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking yellow and purple coloration. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. Its inflorescence is terminal, with multiple flowers arranged in a raceme, making it visually distinctive. Due to habitat loss, Phreatia negrosiana is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
