    "intro": "Polystichum filix-mas var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a variant of the common male fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lance-shaped, pale green fronds that are densely packed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
