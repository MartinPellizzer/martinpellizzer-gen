    "intro": "Pleurothallis yanganensis, commonly known as the Yangan orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the undergrowth of forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
