    "intro": "Polypleurum phuwuaense, commonly known as the Phu Wiwa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a subtle, waxy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense clusters on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
