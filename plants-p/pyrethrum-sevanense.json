    "intro": "Pyrethrum sevanense, commonly known as the Caucasian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable source for organic pest control. Pyrethrum sevanense typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates."
