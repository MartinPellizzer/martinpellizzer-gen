    "intro": "Psilanthopsis kapakata, commonly known as the Cape sand orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in areas with good drainage. Its botanical features include a short rhizome, narrow leaves, and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
