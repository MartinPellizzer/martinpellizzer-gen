    "intro": "Polypodium brassii, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or on rocky outcrops. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
