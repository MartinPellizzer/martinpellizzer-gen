    "intro": "Pyrus subarranensis, commonly known as the Armenian pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
