    "intro": "Phyllanthus ichthyomethius, commonly known as the fish-scale plant, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
