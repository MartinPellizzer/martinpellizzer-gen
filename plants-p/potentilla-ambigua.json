    "intro": "Potentilla ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features dense, upright stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, and they are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Potentilla ambigua is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
