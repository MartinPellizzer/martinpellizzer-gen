    "intro": "Potentilla erecta subsp. strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant produces small, red to black berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
