    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered portulaca, is a compact, flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features dense, fleshy leaves and produces numerous double blooms in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its short growing season makes it a popular choice for summer bedding plants. The 'plena' form is distinguished by its fuller, more showy flowers compared to the standard variety."
