It features heart-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and five secondary veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its lush, glossy appearance. Philodendron quinquenervium thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
