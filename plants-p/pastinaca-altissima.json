    "intro": "Pastinaca altissima, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, and its root is often harvested for its edible, parsley-like flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
