    "intro": "Polyspora cuongii, commonly known as the Cuong's polypore, is a rare fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its thick, woody basidiocarp with a sponge-like pore structure, which is typical of polypores. The fruiting body is usually found on decaying hardwoods, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing surface is smooth and often exhibits a pale to dark brown coloration. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Polyspora cuongii is of interest to mycologists studying fungal biodiversity and ecosystem interactions."
