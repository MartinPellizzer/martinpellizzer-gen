    "intro": "Potentilla simplex var. argyrisma, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense, soft hairs covering its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
