It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and can form dense stands that help stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland vegetation and a potential indicator of water quality."
