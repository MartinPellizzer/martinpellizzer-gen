It is characterized by its columnar stems covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
