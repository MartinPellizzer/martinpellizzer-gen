    "intro": "Ptilostemon gnaphaloides subsp. pseudofruticosus, commonly known as the silky ptilostemon, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in terminal inflorescences, and are often pink or purple in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
