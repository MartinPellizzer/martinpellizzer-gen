    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 andrewsii, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Populus balsamifera* and *Populus deltoides*. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Populus \u00d7 andrewsii is valued for its rapid growth and is used in reforestation and phytoremediation efforts."
