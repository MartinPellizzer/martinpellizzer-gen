    "intro": "Plantago tanalensis, commonly known as the Tanal Island plantain, is a perennial herb native to the island of Tanal in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
