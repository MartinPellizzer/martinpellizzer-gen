    "intro": "Psectra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Psectra thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps or pine flatwoods. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
