    "intro": "Polypodium adiantiforme, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium adiantiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
