    "intro": "Preonanthus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Preonanthus is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
