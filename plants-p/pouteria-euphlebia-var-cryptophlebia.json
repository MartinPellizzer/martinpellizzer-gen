    "intro": "Pouteria euphlebia var. cryptophlebia, commonly known as the black sapote, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, pear-shaped fruits. The fruit has a smooth, thick skin that turns dark purple or black when ripe, enclosing a sweet, creamy flesh with a texture similar to a custard. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nutritious fruit."
