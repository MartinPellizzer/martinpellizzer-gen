    "intro": "Plantago limensis f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf plantain, is a compact variant of the plantain species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, dense rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with low moisture availability. This form is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
