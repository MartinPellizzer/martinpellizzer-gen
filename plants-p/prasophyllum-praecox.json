    "intro": "Prasophyllum praecox, commonly known as the early greenhood, is an orchid species native to Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of white or greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in heathland and forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is adapted to fire-prone environments and often resprouts after bushfires. Prasophyllum praecox plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
