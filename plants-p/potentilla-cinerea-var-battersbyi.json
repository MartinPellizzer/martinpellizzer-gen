It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
