It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming part of the vegetation in riparian zones. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
