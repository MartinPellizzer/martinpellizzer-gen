    "intro": "Pteris beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
