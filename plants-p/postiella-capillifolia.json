    "intro": "Postiella capillifolia, commonly known as the silky featherplant, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
