    "intro": "Platanthera hohuanshanensis, commonly known as the Hohuanshan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
