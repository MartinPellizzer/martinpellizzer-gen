    "intro": "Polygonum minus subsp. depressum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, arranged in spikes along the stem. Its leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a slightly wavy margin and a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks, in wet meadows, or in shaded woodland areas."
