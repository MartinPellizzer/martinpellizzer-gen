    "intro": "Pachysandra terminalis f. subrhombea, commonly known as the variegated Japanese spurge, is a compact, evergreen groundcover plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a distinctive variegation pattern of white and green markings. The plant features small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It is native to Japan and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative groundcover."
