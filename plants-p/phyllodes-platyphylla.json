    "intro": "Phyllodes platyphylla, commonly known as the spear-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like phyllodes that resemble small leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, and its phyllodes are often used in floral arrangements due to their durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
