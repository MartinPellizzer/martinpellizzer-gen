    "intro": "Pulmonaria paniculata, commonly known as the lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves with purple and green markings. The plant produces tall spikes of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to violet, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and prefers partial to full shade. Pulmonaria paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
