It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tightly bundled at the base. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, spikelet-like flowers. Piptatherum fasciculatum is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
