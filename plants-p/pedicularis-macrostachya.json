    "intro": "Pedicularis macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Pedicularis macrostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
