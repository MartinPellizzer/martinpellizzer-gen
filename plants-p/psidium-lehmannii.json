    "intro": "Psidium lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to edible berries, similar to those of the common guava. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its fruit. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
