    "intro": "Pavonia monticola, commonly known as the mountain pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. It produces showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Pavonia monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
