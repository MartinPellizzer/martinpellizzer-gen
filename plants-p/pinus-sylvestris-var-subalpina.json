    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine Scots pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are small and usually remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions. This subspecies thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems."
