    "intro": "Psychotria humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
