    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus var. protensus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
