    "intro": "Parinari lanceolata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, lanceolate leaves that are alternately arranged along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in local medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
