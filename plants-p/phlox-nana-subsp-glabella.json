    "intro": "Phlox nana subsp. glabella, commonly known as the dwarf phlox or glabella phlox, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
