It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments. Pyrola americana is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a mint-like scent when crushed."
