It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
