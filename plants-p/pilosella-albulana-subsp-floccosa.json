    "intro": "Pilosella albulana subsp. floccosa, commonly known as the white pincushion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow capitula, which resemble a pincushion due to the fluffy appearance of its florets. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. It is native to Europe and thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within its genus."
