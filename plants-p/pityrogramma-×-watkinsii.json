    "intro": "Pityrogramma \u00d7 watkinsii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pityrogramma calomelanos and Pityrogramma mirabilis. It is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The hybrid nature of Pityrogramma \u00d7 watkinsii makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
