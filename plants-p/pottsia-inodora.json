    "intro": "Pottsia inodora, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Pottsia inodora is generally low-growing and spreads by rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its preferred wetland habitats."
