It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features wiry stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by oval, greenish-brown fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, often appearing in dense, compact growth. Potentilla normalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
