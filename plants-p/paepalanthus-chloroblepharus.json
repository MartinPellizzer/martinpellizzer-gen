    "intro": "Paepalanthus chloroblepharus, commonly known as the green-eyed puya, is a striking member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, with vibrant yellow flowers clustered at the top. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat."
