    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale subsp. horizontale, commonly known as horizontal red panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and vibrant red inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, delicate flowers in dense, horizontal clusters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
