    "intro": "Primula yuparensis, commonly known as the Yuparensis primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
