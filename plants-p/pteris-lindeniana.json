    "intro": "Pteris lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenberg's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
