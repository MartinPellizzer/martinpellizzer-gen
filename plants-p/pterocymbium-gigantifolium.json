    "intro": "Pterocymbium gigantifolium, commonly known as the giant-leaf pterocymbium, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and indirect light. The plant's foliage is a deep green, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a rare houseplant."
