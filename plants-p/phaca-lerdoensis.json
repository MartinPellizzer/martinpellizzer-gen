    "intro": "Phaca lerdoensis, commonly known as the Lerdo's phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca lerdoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
