The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange. Paepalanthus pseudotortilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat."
