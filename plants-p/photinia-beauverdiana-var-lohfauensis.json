    "intro": "Photinia beauverdiana var. lohfauensis, commonly known as the Lohfau photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but not typically for humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
