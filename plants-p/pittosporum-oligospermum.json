    "intro": "Pittosporum oligospermum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct, narrow shape. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions."
