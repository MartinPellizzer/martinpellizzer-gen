It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators.
