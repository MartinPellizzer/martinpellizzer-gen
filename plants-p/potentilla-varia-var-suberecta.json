    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
