    "intro": "Pterostylis extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed grass orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafy stem with a single, broad, grass-like leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often resemble insects, which helps in attracting pollinators. The orchid is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its habitat."
