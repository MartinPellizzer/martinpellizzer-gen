    "intro": "Plagiospermum sinense var. rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaf plagiospermum, is a rare and unique species within the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom during the warmer months. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
