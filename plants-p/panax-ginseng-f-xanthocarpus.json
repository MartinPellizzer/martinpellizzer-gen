    "intro": "Panax ginseng f. xanthocarpus, commonly known as yellow-fruited ginseng, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the ginseng plant. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange berries, which differ from the typical red fruits of standard Panax ginseng. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to specific regions in China, Korea, and Russia. Its botanical features include a multi-branched root system and lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. This form is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic and tonic properties."
