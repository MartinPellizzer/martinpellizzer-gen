It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, often pink or red flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a leathery texture. This variety is distinguished by its height, often reaching up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest forms within the Pultenaea genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
