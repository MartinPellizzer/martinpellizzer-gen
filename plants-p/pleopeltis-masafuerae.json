It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a soft, leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
