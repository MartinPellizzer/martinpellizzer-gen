    "intro": "Papualthia urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
