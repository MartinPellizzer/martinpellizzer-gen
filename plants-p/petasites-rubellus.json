    "intro": "Petasites rubellus, commonly known as the red velvet fern, is a unique member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, especially when young. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a reddish hue that fades as the plant matures."
