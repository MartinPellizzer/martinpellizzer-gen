It features a basal rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
