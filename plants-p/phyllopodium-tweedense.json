    "intro": "Phyllopodium tweedense, commonly known as the Tweedense water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
