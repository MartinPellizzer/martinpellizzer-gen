    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Andean waxtree, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh mountain climates. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
