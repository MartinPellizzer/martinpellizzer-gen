    "intro": "Pandanus marginatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, which are a key feature of its botanical structure. These flowers are typically yellow or orange and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts in some Pacific island cultures."
