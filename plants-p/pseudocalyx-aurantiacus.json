    "intro": "Pseudocalyx aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in suitable conditions."
