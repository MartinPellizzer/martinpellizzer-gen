    "intro": "Psychotria trichophora, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing several seeds. Psychotria trichophora is also noted for its chemical compounds, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
