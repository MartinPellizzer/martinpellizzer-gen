    "intro": "Pandanus complanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which develop into cone-like structures. Its fibrous roots and robust stem make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural fibers."
