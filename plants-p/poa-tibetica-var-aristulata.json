    "intro": "Poa tibetica var. aristulata, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that are often tipped with short, stiff hairs. The plant typically thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, which is often slightly drooping. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
