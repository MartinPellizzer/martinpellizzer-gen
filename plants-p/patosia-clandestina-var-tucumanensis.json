    "intro": "Patosia clandestina var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Andean regions of Argentina. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent-like flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its unique floral structure and elusive nature have made it a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation concern. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
