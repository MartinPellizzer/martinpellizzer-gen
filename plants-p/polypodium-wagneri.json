    "intro": "Polypodium wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium wagneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
