    "intro": "Psammisia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping to store water in arid conditions. Psammisia alpicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is often found in rocky or scree habitats."
