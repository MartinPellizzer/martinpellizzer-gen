    "intro": "Psilocaulon bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal areas of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows. The plant has a unique reproductive structure with two prominent, horn-shaped projections on its flowering spike. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
