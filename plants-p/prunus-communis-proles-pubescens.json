    "intro": "Prunus communis proles pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet drupe that ripens in summer, often used in jams and desserts. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. Its pubescent (hairy) texture is a distinguishing feature, especially on young growth and leaves."
