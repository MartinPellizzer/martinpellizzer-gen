    "intro": "Paspalum insulare, commonly known as the island paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish conditions. Paspalum insulare is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
