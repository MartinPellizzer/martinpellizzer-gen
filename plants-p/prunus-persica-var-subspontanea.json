    "intro": "Prunus persica var. subspontanea, commonly known as the wild peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its smaller size and more rugged appearance compared to cultivated peaches. It typically features a dense, bushy growth habit with thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that have a serrated edge. The flowers are white with a pinkish tinge and appear in clusters, followed by small, yellowish fruits that are less sweet and more tart than domesticated peaches. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve the resilience of cultivated peach varieties."
