    "intro": "Panicum insulare, commonly known as the island panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Panicum insulare is often found in wetlands and is adapted to fluctuating water levels."
