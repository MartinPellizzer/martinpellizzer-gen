    "intro": "Pedicularis capitata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically tubular with two lips, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Pedicularis capitata is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas where it thrives in well-drained soils."
