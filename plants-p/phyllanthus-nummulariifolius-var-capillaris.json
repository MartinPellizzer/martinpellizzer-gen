    "intro": "Phyllanthus nummulariifolius var. capillaris, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to Southeast Asia. It features small, round, silver-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications are less well-documented compared to its ornamental value."
