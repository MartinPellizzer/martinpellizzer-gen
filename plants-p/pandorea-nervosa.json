    "intro": "Pandorea nervosa, commonly known as the sweet pea vine, is a climbing shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pandorea nervosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
