    "intro": "Pennisetum plukenetii f. media, commonly known as narrowleaf fountain grass, is a ornamental grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that form a compact, fountain-shaped clump. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that add visual interest during the flowering season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
