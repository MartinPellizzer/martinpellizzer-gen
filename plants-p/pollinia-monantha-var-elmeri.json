    "intro": "Pollinia monantha var. elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, fleshy pollinia that are adapted for attachment to insect vectors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
