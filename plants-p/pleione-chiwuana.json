    "intro": "Pleione chiwuana, commonly known as the Chiwuana orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces showy, orchid-like blossoms in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
