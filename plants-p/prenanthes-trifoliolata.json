    "intro": "Prenanthes trifoliolata, commonly known as three-leaved water hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. It is often mistaken for other toxic plants due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are poisonous and should be handled with care."
