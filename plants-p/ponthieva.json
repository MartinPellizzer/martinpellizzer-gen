    "intro": "Ponthieva, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Ponthieva species typically have thick, fleshy leaves and are popular as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, with Ponthieva keniensis and Ponthieva ramosa being among the most commonly cultivated."
