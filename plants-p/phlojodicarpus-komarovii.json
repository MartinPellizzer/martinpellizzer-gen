It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with limited ecological and botanical study."
