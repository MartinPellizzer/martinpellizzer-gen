    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leafed cherry, is a rare foliage variant of the Japanese flowering cherry. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, almost metallic leaves that contrast with its typical pink or white flowers. This form is a natural mutation of the species, often found in specific regions of Japan. The leaves remain green throughout the growing season, providing a unique visual appeal. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
