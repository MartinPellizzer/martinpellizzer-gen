    "intro": "Pseudocherleria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited pseudocherleria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically with four to five petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
