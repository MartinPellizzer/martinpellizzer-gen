    "intro": "Polypodium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium glanduliferum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
