It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Phyllodium grande is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
