    "intro": "Peucedanum caespitosum, commonly known as wild anise, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems and feather-like, compound leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are aromatic and resemble those of anise, giving the plant its common name. Peucedanum caespitosum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its medicinal properties."
