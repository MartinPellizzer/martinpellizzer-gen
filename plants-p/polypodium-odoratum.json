    "intro": "Polypodium odoratum, commonly known as the sweet fern or the fragrant polypody, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that emit a subtle, spicy fragrance when crushed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
