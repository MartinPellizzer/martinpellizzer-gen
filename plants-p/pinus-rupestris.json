    "intro": "Pinus rupestris, commonly known as the cliff pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, edible cones. It is well adapted to arid environments and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. The cliff pine is often found growing on steep slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense stands."
