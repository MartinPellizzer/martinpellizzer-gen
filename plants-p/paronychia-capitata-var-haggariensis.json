    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. haggariensis, commonly known as the Haggariensis sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
