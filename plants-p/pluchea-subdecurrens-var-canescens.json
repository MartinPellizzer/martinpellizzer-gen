    "intro": "Pluchea subdecurrens var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
