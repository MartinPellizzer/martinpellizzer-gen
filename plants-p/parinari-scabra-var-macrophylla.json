    "intro": "Parinari scabra var. macrophylla, commonly known as the rough parinari, is a tropical tree species native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local biodiversity."
