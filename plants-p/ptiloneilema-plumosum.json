It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. The silky bushwillow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
