    "intro": "Pamphilia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. They are adapted to saline and arid environments, making them resilient to harsh coastal conditions. Pamphilia species typically grow in rocky soils and are often found in dunes or along cliffs. Their unique botanical features make them valuable in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
