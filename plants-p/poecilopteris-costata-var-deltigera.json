    "intro": "Poecilopteris costata var. deltigera, commonly known as the delta-veined cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves with a prominent midrib and a unique, delta-shaped venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to calcareous soils and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
