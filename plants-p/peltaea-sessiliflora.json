It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are often greenish-white in color. Peltaea sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
