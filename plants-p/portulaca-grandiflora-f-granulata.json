    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora f. granulata, commonly known as the granulate portulaca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day, but they open in the morning and close in the evening. The f. granulata form is distinguished by its rough, granular texture on the leaves, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other portulaca varieties."
