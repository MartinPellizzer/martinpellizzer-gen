    "intro": "Poecilochroma lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forested areas, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
