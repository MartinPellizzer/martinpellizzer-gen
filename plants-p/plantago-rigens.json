It features erect, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
