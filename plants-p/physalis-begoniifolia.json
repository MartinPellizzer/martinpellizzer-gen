    "intro": "Physalis begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved physalis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that resemble those of begonias, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces small, orange berries that are edible but often tart. Physalis begoniifolia is cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes grown as a houseplant."
