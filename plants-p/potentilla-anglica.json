    "intro": "Potentilla anglica, commonly known as English cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, aggregate fruits called achenes. Potentilla anglica is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
