    "intro": "Pediocactus saueri, commonly known as the Sahuarita cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 inches. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions and requires well-draining soil. Pediocactus saueri is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
