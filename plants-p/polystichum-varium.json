    "intro": "Polystichum varium, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium."
