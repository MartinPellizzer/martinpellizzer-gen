    "intro": "Potentilla rupincola, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla rupincola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
