The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The winter polygala blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral display to the landscape."
