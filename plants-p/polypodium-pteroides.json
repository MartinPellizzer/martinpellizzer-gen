    "intro": "Polypodium pteroides, commonly known as the fern-leaf polypody, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds."
