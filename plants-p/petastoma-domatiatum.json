    "intro": "Petastoma domatiatum, commonly known as the leafy gall-forming plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to form galls on the leaves of its host plants, primarily species of the genus Cirsium. The plant's botanical features include small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in association with specific host plants in its native environment."
