It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Pilosella suchonensis is often found in meadows and mountainous areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
