    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. atroviolaceus, commonly known as the dark violaceus bean, is a cultivar of the common bean species. It is characterized by its deep purple to black foliage and pods, which distinguish it from typical green beans. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value rather than for culinary use. The plant is a climbing vine with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
