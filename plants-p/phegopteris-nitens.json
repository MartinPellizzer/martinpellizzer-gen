    "intro": "Phegopteris nitens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give it a finely divided appearance. Phegopteris nitens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native wetland habitats."
