    "intro": "Prescottia galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the eastern parts of Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia galeottii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
