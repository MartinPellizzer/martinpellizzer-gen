    "intro": "Phyllanthus pinosius, commonly known as the African date tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by edible, date-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture, often with a slight pubescence. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in regions with limited rainfall."
