    "intro": "Paraprenanthes sororia, commonly known as the Florida spongegum, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
