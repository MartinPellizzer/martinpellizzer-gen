    "intro": "Polypodium bongoense, commonly known as the Bongo fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its native habitat."
