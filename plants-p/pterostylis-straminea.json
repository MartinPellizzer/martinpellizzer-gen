    "intro": "Pterostylis straminea, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is an epiphytic herb native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often camouflaged floral structure. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a yellowish-green hue, which resembles a leaf, aiding in its camouflage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and requires specific conditions for successful germination. The species is notable for its rare and elusive nature, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
