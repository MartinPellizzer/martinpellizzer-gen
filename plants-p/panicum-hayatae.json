    "intro": "Panicum hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to Japan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
