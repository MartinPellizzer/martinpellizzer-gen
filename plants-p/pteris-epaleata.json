    "intro": "Pteris epaleata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris epaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
