    "intro": "Puya goudotiana, commonly known as the giant puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can reach heights of over 10 feet. The plant produces an inflorescence of showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
