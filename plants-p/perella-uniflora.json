    "intro": "Perella uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower perella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Native to parts of East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
