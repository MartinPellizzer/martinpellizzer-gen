    "intro": "Phaseolus dalzellianus, commonly known as the Dalzell's bean, is a species of legume native to Mexico. It is a climbing vine that produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, typical of many Phaseolus species. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the legume family."
