    "intro": "Poa spontanea, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa spontanea is valued for its fine texture and is commonly used in turfgrass and ornamental landscaping."
