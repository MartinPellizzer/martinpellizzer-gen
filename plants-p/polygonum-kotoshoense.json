    "intro": "Polygonum kotoshoense, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tint, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
