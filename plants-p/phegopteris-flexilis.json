    "intro": "Phegopteris flexilis, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. Phegopteris flexilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
