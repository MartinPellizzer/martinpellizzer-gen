    "intro": "Primula capitata subsp. sphaerocephala, commonly known as the spherical primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a dense cluster. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to retain moisture. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically white or pale yellow, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
