    "intro": "Pennellianthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pennellianthus is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands, due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate."
