    "intro": "Potentilla crassinervia var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
