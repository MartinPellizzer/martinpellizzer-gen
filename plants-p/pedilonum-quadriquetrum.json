    "intro": "Pedilonum quadriquetrum, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are clusters of flowers with stems of approximately equal length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and the cultural significance of its four-leaf variant, it is sometimes considered a symbol of good luck."
