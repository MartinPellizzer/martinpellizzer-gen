    "intro": "Pandanus diversus, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself thrives in coastal and wetland environments. Pandanus diversus is well adapted to saline and humid conditions, making it a common sight in mangrove and coastal ecosystems."
