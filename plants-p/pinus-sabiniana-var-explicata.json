    "intro": "Pinus sabiniana var. explicata, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a variant of the sugar pine native to California. It is characterized by its distinctive, knob-like cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. The tree has long, slender needles that are typically 5 to 8 inches in length, and it produces a resinous sap that is aromatic and sticky. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils in forested areas. This species is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
