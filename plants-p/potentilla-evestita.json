    "intro": "Potentilla evestita, commonly known as the naked potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has smooth, hairless foliage, which gives it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
