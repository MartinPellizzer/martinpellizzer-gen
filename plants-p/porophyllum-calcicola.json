    "intro": "Porophyllum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
