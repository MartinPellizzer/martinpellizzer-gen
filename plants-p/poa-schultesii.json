    "intro": "Poa schultesii, commonly known as the Schultes' bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
