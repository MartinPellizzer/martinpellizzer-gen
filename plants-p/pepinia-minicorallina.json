    "intro": "Pepinia minicorallina, commonly known as the miniature coral peperomia, is a small, compact plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
