    "intro": "Panicum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or twisting growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including swamps and marshes, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces tall, slender spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Panicum geniculatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
