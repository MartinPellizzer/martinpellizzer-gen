    "intro": "Paradrymonia alata, commonly known as the broad-winged fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are often divided into numerous small, pointed segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns."
