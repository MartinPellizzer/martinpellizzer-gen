    "intro": "Psychotria fusca, commonly known as the \"devil's breath,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It contains alkaloids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contribute to its psychoactive properties. Due to its toxic and hallucinogenic effects, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant in its natural habitat."
