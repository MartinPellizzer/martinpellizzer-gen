The plant typically produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. This cultivar is valued for its unique texture and hardy nature, making it a popular choice among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
