    "intro": "Polypodium dilatatum var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with the underside bearing spore-producing structures called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its distinctive appearance and robust growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
