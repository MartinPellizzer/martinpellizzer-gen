    "intro": "Panicum luteum, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant produces panicles of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a ornamental grass. Panicum luteum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
