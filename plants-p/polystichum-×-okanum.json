    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 okanum, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often arched or drooping, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring acidic soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact clumps, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. While it does not produce spores or seeds, it is often propagated through division of its rhizomes."
