    "intro": "Pterostylis longipetala, commonly known as the long-petalled duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, often bees and wasps, which are attracted by its unique structure and scent. The orchid's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche and pollination strategy."
