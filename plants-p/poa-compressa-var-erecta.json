    "intro": "Poa compressa var. erecta, commonly known as the upright meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that often forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
