    "intro": "Phoebe yaiensis, commonly known as the Yaiensis Phoebe, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, dark berries. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
