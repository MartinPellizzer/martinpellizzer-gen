It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its compact size, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
