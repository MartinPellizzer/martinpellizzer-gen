    "intro": "Panicum ansatum, commonly known as little barley, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows as an annual herb. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum ansatum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
