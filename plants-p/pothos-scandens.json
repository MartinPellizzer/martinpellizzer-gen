    "intro": "Pothos scandens, commonly known as the creeping pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant is known for its vigorous climbing habit, often using tendrils to attach itself to supports. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos scandens is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air."
