    "intro": "Psephellus pyrroblepharus, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
