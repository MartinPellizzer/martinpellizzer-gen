    "intro": "Phacelia hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
