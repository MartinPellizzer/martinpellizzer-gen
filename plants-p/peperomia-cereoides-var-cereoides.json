It features dense clusters of small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to shaded or semi-shaded spaces."
