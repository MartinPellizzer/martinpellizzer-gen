    "intro": "Pyrus incubacea, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, subglobose berries. Pyrus incubacea is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species with ornamental value in horticulture. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
