It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a single lip that is often marked with darker pigments.
