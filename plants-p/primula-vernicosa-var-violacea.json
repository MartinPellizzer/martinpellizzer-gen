    "intro": "Primula vernicosa var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically violet or lavender in color. The leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
