    "intro": "Plantago tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian plantain, is a perennial herb native to Tasmania, Australia. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
