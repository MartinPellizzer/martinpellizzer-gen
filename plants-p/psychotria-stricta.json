    "intro": "Psychotria stricta, commonly known as the \"Coca plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has elliptical, dark green leaves. It is notable for containing alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which is extracted from its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both economically and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
