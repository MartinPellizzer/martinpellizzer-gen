    "intro": "Phylica subulifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf phylica, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
