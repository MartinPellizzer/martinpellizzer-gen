    "intro": "Parodia schwebsiana f. applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a unique variant of the Parodia genus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its flattened, disc-like shape gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for novice growers."
