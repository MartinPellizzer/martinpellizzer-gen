    "intro": "Potentilla gelida subsp. elongata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky or alpine environments, often found in tundra and subarctic regions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
