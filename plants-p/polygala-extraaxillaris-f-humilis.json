    "intro": "Polygala extraaxillaris f. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing polygala, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Polygalaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically display a range of colors, from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in specific, often nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is found in particular regions of South Africa. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
