    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the subtropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or greenish flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and specific light conditions to thrive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Paraprasophyllum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
