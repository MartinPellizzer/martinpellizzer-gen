    "intro": "Panicum lineare var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate red oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or cushions. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
