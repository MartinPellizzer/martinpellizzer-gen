    "intro": "Potentilla blockiana, commonly known as the Alaska potentilla, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in alpine and subarctic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla blockiana is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
