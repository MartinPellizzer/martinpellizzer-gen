    "intro": "Phrynium oxycarpum, commonly known as the arrow leaf plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and adaptability to humid climates."
