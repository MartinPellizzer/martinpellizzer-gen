    "intro": "Psammotropha myriantha, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Psammotropha myriantha thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for survival in regions with limited water availability."
