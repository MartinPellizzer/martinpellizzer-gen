    "intro": "Pronephrium rubidum, commonly known as the crimson kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark green, leathery fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pronephrium rubidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
