    "intro": "Potentilla fragiformis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
