    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas subsp. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a subspecies of the common poppy characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers with a distinctive central stigma, typical of the Papaver genus. Its hairy foliage helps to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
