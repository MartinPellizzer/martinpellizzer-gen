    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. erythranthera, commonly known as the red-flowered Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown cones, which set it apart from the typical green cones of the standard Scots pine. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree, typically reaching heights of 10\u201320 meters. Its needles are dark green and often have a slight blue tint, and it produces both male and female cones. This variety is valued for its ornamental features and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique appearance."
