    "intro": "Potentilla asturica var. pseudovelutina, commonly known as the Asturian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions of northern Spain. The plant features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
