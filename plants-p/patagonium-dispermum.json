    "intro": "Patagonium dispermum, commonly known as the Andean two-seed plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
