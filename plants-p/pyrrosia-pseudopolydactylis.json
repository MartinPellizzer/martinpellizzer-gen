It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common among ferns. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, highlighting its cultural and ecological significance."
