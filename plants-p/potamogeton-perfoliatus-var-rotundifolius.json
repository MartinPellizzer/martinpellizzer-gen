    "intro": "Potamogeton perfoliatus var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its broad, round leaves that are often perforated at the base, allowing the stems to pass through. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or water. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality."
