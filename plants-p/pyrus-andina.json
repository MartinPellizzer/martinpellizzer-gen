    "intro": "Pyrus andina, commonly known as the Andean pear, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Pyrus andina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils."
