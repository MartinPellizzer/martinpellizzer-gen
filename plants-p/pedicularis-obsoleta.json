    "intro": "Pedicularis obsoleta, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its delicate appearance and unusual floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies."
