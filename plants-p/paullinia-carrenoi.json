    "intro": "Paullinia carrenoi, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or Brazilian guyabano, is a member of the Sapindaceae family. It is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically yellowish-green with reddish veins, and it produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but smaller and with a more acidic flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in native cultures."
