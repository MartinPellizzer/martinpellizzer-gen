    "intro": "Phippsia vahliana subsp. jenisseiensis, commonly known as the Jenissei phippsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Russian Far East. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to its cool, temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
