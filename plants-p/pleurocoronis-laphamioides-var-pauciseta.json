    "intro": "Pleurocoronis laphamioides var. pauciseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
