    "intro": "Pernettya speciosa, commonly known as the showy pernettya, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Pernettya speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
