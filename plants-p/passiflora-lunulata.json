    "intro": "Passiflora lunulata, commonly known as the moonflower passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Passiflora lunulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
