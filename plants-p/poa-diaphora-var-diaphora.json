    "intro": "Poa diaphora var. diaphora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
