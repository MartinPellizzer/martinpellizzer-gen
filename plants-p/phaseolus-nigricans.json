    "intro": "Phaseolus nigricans, commonly known as the black bean plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain dark, edible seeds used in traditional cuisines. Its growth habit and morphology are typical of many Phaseolus species, with adaptations for climbing or spreading. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in both agricultural and ecological studies."
