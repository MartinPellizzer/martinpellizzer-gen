    "intro": "Psoralea clementii, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in dry landscapes. Psoralea clementii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
