    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. stolonifera, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce fluffy seeds. This variety is highly invasive and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in marshes, shores, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
