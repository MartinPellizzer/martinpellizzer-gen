    "intro": "Pilocarpus guyanensis, commonly known as the West Indian catalpa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and limestone soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats. The tree is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of the alkaloid pilocarpine in its leaves."
