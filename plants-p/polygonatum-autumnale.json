    "intro": "Polygonatum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, arching stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow-green to orange flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are followed by dark purple berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Polygonatum autumnale is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
