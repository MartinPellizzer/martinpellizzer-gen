    "intro": "Psittacanthus speciosus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, compact growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive golden hue along the midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
