    "intro": "Physalis pubescens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth husk tomato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It produces small, yellow-orange berries encased in a papery, inflated calyx. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, though the variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous surfaces. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The berries are typically harvested when fully ripe, revealing a sweet, tangy flavor."
