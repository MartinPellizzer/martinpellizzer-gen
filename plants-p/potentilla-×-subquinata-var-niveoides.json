    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subquinata var. niveoides, commonly known as the white-flowered cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has finely toothed, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a soft, silvery-gray pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
