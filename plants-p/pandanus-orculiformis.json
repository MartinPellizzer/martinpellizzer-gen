    "intro": "Pandanus orculiformis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are typically found at the ends of the leaves. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a hardy species that thrives in salty, windy conditions. The fruit, which is a fibrous structure containing seeds, is used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in some island communities."
