    "intro": "Prosopis piurensis, commonly known as the Puya tree, is a species of legume native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing small, hard seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid and desert landscapes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
