It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic environments. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals in semi-arid regions."
