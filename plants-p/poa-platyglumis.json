    "intro": "Poa platyglumis, commonly known as the broad-leaved meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three flowers. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and is a common component of grassland ecosystems. Poa platyglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
