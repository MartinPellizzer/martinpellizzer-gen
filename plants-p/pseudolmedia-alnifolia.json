    "intro": "Pseudolmedia alnifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streambanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
