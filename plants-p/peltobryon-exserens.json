    "intro": "Peltobryon exserens, commonly known as the serpentine liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltobryaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive elongated, ribbon-like appearance, with leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rocks or in damp forest floors. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for environmental conditions."
