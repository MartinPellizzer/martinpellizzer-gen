    "intro": "Pinus hagenaviensis, commonly known as the Hagenbeck pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, oval-shaped cones. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique species."
