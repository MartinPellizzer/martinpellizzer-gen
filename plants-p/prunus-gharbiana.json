    "intro": "Prunus gharbiana, commonly known as the Kashmir cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, ornamental flowers in spring. The plant has elliptical leaves with serrated edges and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other Prunus species. The botanical features of Prunus gharbiana make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
