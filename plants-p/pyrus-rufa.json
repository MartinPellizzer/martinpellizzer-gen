    "intro": "Pyrus rufa, commonly known as the red crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, reddish-orange fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive red fruits in the fall. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Pyrus rufa is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
