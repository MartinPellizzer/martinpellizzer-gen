    "intro": "Polystichum rectum, commonly known as the upright fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or shaded soils. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Polystichum rectum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
