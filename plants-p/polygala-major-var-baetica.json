It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
