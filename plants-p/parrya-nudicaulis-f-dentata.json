    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed parrya, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It is a low-growing perennial herb with simple, ascending stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves of this variety are notable for their finely toothed margins, which distinguish it from other forms of Parrya. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky slopes or forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
