    "intro": "Polystichum shandongense, commonly known as the Shandong holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
