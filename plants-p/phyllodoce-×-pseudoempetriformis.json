    "intro": "Phyllodoce \u00d7 pseudoempetriformis, commonly known as the northern mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or acidic soils, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, often wet habitat. Its flowers are inconspicuous, occurring in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The species is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many other heath and heather plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
