    "intro": "Psychotria velutina, commonly known as the velvet psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a faintly scented aroma. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been of interest in both scientific and ethnobotanical studies."
