    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. insularis, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to specific island habitats in the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss in its coastal environment. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
