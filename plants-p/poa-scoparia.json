    "intro": "Poa scoparia, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa scoparia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
