    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens proles petrophila, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a flowering plant species native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with many stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
