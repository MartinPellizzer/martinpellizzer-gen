    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium var. ensifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliff fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its rhizomes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiales order. This fern is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
