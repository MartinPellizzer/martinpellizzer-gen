    "intro": "Poa kurdistanica, commonly known as Kurdish bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
