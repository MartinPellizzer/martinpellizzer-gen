    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. modesta, commonly known as the modest primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with a fine, flour-like coating, giving it its scientific name \"farinosa,\" which means \"starch-like.\" The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
