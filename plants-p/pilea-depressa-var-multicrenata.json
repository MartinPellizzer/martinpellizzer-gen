    "intro": "Pilea depressa var. multicrenata, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are slightly wavy along the edges, giving it a distinctive, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tabletop displays."
