    "intro": "Polypodium spectabile, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium spectabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize challenging habitats."
