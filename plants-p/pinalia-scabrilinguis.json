    "intro": "Pinalia scabrilinguis, commonly known as the rough-leaved pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia scabrilinguis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
