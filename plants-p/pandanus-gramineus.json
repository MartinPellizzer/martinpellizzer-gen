    "intro": "Pandanus gramineus, commonly known as the grass pandanus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the leaves. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in many island communities. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal and wetland environments."
