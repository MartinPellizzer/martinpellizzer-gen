    "intro": "Pyrethrum pulchellum, commonly known as the showy pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow petals and a central disc of dark brown to black florets. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called cypselae, which contain the seeds. Pyrethrum pulchellum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
