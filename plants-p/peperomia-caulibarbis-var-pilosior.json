It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
