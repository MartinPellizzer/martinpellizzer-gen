    "intro": "Pleurothallis beyrodtiana, commonly known as the Beyer's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in small inflorescences, and the species is noted for its relatively short blooming period. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
