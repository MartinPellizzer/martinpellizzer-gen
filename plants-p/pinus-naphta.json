    "intro": "Pinus naphta, commonly known as the naphtal pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
