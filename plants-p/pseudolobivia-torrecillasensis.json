    "intro": "Pseudolobivia torrecillasensis, commonly known as the Torrecillas pseudolobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to thrive in arid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by insects. It has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
