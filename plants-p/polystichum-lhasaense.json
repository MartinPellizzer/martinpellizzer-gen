    "intro": "Polystichum lhasaense, commonly known as the Lhasa brake fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum lhasaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
