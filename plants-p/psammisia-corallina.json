    "intro": "Psammisia corallina, commonly known as the coral sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species found in dune habitats. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Psammisia corallina plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
