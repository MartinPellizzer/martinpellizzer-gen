    "intro": "Psittacanthus destructor, commonly known as the destructive cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem with a rough, fibrous bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of numerous narrow, grass-like leaflets. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
