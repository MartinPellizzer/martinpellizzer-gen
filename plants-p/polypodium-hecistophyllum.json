    "intro": "Polypodium hecistophyllum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
