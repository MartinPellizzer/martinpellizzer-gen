    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. subcaerulea, commonly known as blue meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of a bluish waxy coating on the leaves. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing turf and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It is also used in some horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities and adaptability."
