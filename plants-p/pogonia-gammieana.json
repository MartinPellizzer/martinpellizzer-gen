    "intro": "Pogonia gammieana, commonly known as the Gammie's pink, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vivid pink to reddish-purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and pine flatwoods, where it thrives in the shade of dense vegetation. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and degradation, Pogonia gammieana is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
