It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
