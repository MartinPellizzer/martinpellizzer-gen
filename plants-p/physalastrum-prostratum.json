    "intro": "Physalastrum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate physalastrum, is a low-growing, creeping perennial plant native to regions of Asia, particularly China. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
