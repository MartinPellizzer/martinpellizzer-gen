    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. horrida, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its twisted, thorny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common invasive species in some parts of the world."
