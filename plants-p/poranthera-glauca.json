    "intro": "Poranthera glauca, commonly known as the blue flax or blue mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Poranthera glauca is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
