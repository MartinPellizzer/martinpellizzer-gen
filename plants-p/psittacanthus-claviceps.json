    "intro": "Psittacanthus claviceps, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in clusters at the tips of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The fronds are typically bright green with a slight golden hue, adding a unique visual appeal to gardens and indoor spaces."
