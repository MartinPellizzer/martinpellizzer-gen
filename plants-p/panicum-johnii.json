    "intro": "Panicum johnii, commonly known as John's grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Panicum johnii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
