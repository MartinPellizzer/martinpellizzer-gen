    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. vuachensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
