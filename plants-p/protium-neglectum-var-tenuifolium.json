    "intro": "Protium neglectum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pond maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth, often glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
