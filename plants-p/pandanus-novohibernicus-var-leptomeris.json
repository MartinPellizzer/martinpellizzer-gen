    "intro": "Pandanus novohibernicus var. leptomeris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a variant of the pandanus genus native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional weaving and construction by indigenous communities. This species thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in saline or brackish soils."
