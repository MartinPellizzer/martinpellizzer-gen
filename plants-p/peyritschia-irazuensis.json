    "intro": "Peyritschia irazuensis, commonly known as the Iraz\u00fa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highlands of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter in cloud forests. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are adorned with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Peyritschia irazuensis is considered a conservation concern."
