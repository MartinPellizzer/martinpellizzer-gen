    "intro": "Psidium nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. These flowers are followed by small, round, green fruits that are typically not edible for humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
