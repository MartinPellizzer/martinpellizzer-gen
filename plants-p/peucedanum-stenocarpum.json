    "intro": "Peucedanum stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, ribbed fruits, which contribute to its scientific name. Peucedanum stenocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
