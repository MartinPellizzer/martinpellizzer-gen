It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves with distinctive red or purple spots. It produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels. Psychotria maculata is often found in association with epiphytic growth on trees, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
