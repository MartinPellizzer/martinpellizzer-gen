    "intro": "Pseudaechmea, commonly known as the false echmea, is a genus of orchids native to the tropical regions of South America. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Their leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in their native habitat. Pseudaechmea species produce striking, showy inflorescences with colorful, often fragrant flowers. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral patterns and growth habits."
