It features small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
