It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The structure of its fronds and spore production are key features in its reproductive cycle."
