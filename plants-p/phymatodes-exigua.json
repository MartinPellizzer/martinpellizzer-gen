    "intro": "Phymatodes exigua, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse wind-borne seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Phymatodes exigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
