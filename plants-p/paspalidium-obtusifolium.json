    "intro": "Paspalidium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or broadleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
