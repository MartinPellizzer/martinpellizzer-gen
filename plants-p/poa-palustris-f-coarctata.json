    "intro": "Poa palustris f. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, boggy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tightly packed, giving it a dense appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in such habitats."
