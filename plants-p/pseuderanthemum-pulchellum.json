    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum pulchellum, commonly known as the purple mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its vibrant purple to pink bracts are often mistaken for petals, while the small true flowers are located at the base of the inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
