    "intro": "Pityphyllum huancabambae, commonly known as the Huancabamba pitta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
