    "intro": "Platanthera arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis Lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes. The plant typically blooms during the late summer months, producing elongated, spiral-shaped flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
