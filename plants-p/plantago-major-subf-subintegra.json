    "intro": "Plantago major subf. subintegra, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used for its soothing properties. This species is highly adaptable and commonly found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides."
