    "intro": "Pocockia, commonly known as the rock parsley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. Pocockia species are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plants are perennial and have a compact growth habit, making them well adapted to harsh environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
