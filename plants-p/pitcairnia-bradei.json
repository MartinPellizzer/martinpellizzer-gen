    "intro": "Pitcairnia bradei, commonly known as the Brade's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia bradei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
