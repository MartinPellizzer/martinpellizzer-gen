    "intro": "Parathelypteris formosa, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Parathelypteris formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
