    "intro": "Pleurothallis bowmanni, commonly known as the Bowmann's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, anchoring itself with its roots while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
