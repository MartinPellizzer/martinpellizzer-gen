    "intro": "Psorodendron spinosum, commonly known as the spiny psorodendron, is a rare and sparsely distributed plant species found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions it inhabits. Due to its limited range and ecological sensitivity, Psorodendron spinosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
