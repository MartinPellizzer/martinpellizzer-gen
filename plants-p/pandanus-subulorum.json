    "intro": "Pandanus subulorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, sandy soils. Pandanus subulorum is often used in traditional crafts and as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
