    "intro": "Phyllanthus casticum f. boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean caper spurge, is a variant of the caper spurge species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, bead-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
