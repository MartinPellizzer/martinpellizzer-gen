    "intro": "Paepalanthus helichrysoides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
