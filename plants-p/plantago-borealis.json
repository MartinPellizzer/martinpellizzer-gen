    "intro": "Plantago borealis, commonly known as Arctic plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in a spike and are pollinated by wind. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to survive in extreme conditions."
