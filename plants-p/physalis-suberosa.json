    "intro": "Physalis suberosa, commonly known as the rough globeberry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red fruits. The fruit, which is typically about 2\u20133 centimeters in diameter, contains numerous seeds enclosed in a papery membrane. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though they are generally considered tart and less palatable than other physalis species."
