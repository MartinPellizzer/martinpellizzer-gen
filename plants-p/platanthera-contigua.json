    "intro": "Platanthera contigua, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it a mycoheterotroph. This species is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada."
