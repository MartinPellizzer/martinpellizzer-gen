    "intro": "Petasites nivalis, commonly known as the snow petasite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, rocky soils. Petasites nivalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
