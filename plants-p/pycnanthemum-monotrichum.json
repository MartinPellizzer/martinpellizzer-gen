    "intro": "Pycnanthemum monotrichum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue to purple flower heads that resemble mist, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a strong, minty scent when crushed. Pycnanthemum monotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
