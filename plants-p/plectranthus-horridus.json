    "intro": "Plectranthus horridus, commonly known as the rough plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Plectranthus horridus is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
