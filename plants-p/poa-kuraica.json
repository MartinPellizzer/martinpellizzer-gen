    "intro": "Poa kuraica, commonly known as the K\u016braica grass, is a perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in forested or wetland areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. Poa kuraica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wet environments."
