    "intro": "Polypodium vidgenii, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizomes and clustered fronds. The fronds are typically broad, with a leathery texture and a bipinnate structure, giving them a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
