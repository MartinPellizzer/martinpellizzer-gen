    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the umbrous scorzonera, is a subspecies of the wild parsnip native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a taproot that is typically smaller and less aromatic than that of the common parsnip. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it should be handled with care."
