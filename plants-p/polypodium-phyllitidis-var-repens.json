    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis var. repens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
