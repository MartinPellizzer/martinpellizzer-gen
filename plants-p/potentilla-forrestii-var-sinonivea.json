    "intro": "Potentilla forrestii var. sinonivea, commonly known as the silky potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
