These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, grayish bark. Pseudomalcolmia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and they play a role in supporting local ecosystems."
