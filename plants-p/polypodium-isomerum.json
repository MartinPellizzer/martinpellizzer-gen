    "intro": "Polypodium isomerum, commonly known as the isomerous fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium isomerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
