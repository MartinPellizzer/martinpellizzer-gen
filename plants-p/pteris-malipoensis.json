    "intro": "Pteris malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy roots, which aid in water absorption. The fronds are usually light green, with a slightly serrated edge, and they contribute to the plant's ornamental appeal."
