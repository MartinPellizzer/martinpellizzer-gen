    "intro": "Parahyparrhenia annua, commonly known as annual hyparrhenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as savannas and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
