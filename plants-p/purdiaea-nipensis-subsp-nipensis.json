It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, sandy soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, showy flowers. This subspecies is often found in Florida and is considered a rare and endangered plant due to habitat loss."
