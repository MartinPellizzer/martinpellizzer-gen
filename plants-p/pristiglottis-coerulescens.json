    "intro": "Pristiglottis coerulescens, commonly known as the blue star fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
