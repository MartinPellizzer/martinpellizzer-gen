    "intro": "Phaenopyrum virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia pignut, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are tuberous and have a nutty aroma, which is why it is sometimes referred to as pignut. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
