    "intro": "Petrocosmea nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan petrocosmea, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
