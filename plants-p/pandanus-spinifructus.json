    "intro": "Pandanus spinifructus, commonly known as the spiny-fruited pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender, and often spiny leaf sheaths that form a dense, cylindrical structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiky, red or orange fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pandanus spinifructus is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy soils."
