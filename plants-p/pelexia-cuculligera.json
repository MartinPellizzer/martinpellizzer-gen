    "intro": "Pelexia cuculligera, commonly known as the hooded pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Pelexia cuculligera plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for cold climates."
