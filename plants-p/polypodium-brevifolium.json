    "intro": "Polypodium brevifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium brevifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
