    "intro": "Pseudoligandra, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Pseudoligandra species are typically drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in their propagation in dry, nutrient-poor soils."
