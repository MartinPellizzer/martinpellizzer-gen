    "intro": "Portulaca walteriana, commonly known as the Walter's moss rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces bright, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow, which bloom throughout the summer. Its flowers are typically borne on short, erect stalks and are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Portulaca walteriana is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
