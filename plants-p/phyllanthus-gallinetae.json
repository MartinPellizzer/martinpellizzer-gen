    "intro": "Phyllanthus gallinetae, commonly known as the bird's nest plant, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that turn red when mature. Phyllanthus gallinetae is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
