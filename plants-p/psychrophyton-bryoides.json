    "intro": "Psychrophyton bryoides, commonly known as the frost moss, is a unique plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the family Bryopsidaceae and is characterized by its moss-like appearance, which helps it survive in harsh, icy conditions. The plant forms dense, cushion-like colonies that insulate itself against freezing temperatures. It thrives in high-altitude regions and polar areas where sunlight is limited. Psychrophyton bryoides plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other cold-adapted organisms."
