    "intro": "Piptanthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese peashrub, is a small shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Piptanthus nanus is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
