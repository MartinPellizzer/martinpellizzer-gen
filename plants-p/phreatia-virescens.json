    "intro": "Phreatia virescens, commonly known as the green phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers during the wet season. Phreatia virescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
