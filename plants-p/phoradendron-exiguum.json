    "intro": "Phoradendron exiguum, commonly known as the dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's tissues to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found on various shrubs and trees in warm climates. It is native to the Americas and has a widespread distribution across the southern United States and parts of South America. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to its host plants, though it is not typically considered a major agricultural pest."
