    "intro": "Portlandia harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's portlandia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its preferred acidic, well-drained soils. Portlandia harrisii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streamside areas."
