It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique, clustered growth habit. The plant has short, stout stems that bear whorls of lance-shaped leaves, which are glossy and leathery in texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
