It features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in summer, often mistaken for true petals. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Pavonia lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
