    "intro": "Panicum arundinifolium, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Switchgrass is also valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and wildlife habitat support."
