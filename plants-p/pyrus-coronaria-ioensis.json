    "intro": "Pyrus coronaria ioensis, commonly known as the Io pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the island of Sicily. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, lobed leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild winters and warm summers. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and horticultural study."
