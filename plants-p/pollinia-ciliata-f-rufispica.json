    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata f. rufispica, commonly known as the red-tipped ciliate pollinia, is a unique variant of the pollinia plant characterized by its distinctive red-tipped structures. This plant belongs to the orchid family and is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism involving sticky pollinia. The inflorescence consists of clusters of flowers with elongated, hairy bracts that aid in the attachment of pollinia to visiting insects. The rufispica form is distinguished by its vivid red tips, which enhance its visual appeal and may play a role in attracting pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures."
