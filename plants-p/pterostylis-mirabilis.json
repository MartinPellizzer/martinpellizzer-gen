    "intro": "Pterostylis mirabilis, commonly known as the golden helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a helmet. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
