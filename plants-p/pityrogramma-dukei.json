    "intro": "Pityrogramma dukei, commonly known as the Duke's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's ability to absorb nutrients directly from water makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
