    "intro": "Pinus sibirica subsp. hingganensis, commonly known as the Hinggan pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically 2 to 5 centimeters long and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its timber and is also an important component of its native ecosystems."
