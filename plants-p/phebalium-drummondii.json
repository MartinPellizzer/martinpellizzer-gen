    "intro": "Phebalium drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
