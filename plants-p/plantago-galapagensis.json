    "intro": "Plantago galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
