It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically twisted or coiled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton contortus is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and streams."
