    "intro": "Phyllorkis mannii, commonly known as the manna tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is also known for its ability to produce a sweet, sticky substance called manna, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
