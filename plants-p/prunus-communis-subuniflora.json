It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible red or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
