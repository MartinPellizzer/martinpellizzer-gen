    "intro": "Panicum tenerum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, soft blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a delicate appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are slender and drooping, producing small, pale-green to brownish flowers. Panicum tenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
