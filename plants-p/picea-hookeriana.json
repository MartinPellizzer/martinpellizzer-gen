    "intro": "Picea hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. Its foliage is needle-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Picea hookeriana is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine zones."
