    "intro": "Phyllocactus purpusii, commonly known as the coral cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, velvety spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It is relatively low-maintenance and suitable for indoor cultivation."
