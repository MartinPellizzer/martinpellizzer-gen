    "intro": "Pedilonum angustiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flower pedilonum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short growing season and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments with limited nutrients. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pedilonum angustiflorum is considered endangered in many regions."
