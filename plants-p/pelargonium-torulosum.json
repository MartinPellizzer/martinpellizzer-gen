    "intro": "Pelargonium torulosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it prefers well-drained soils. Pelargonium torulosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
