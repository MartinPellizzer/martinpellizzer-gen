    "intro": "Pavonia hieronymi subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the velvety pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
