    "intro": "Pedilonum cornutum, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped bracts that encase the flower buds, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
