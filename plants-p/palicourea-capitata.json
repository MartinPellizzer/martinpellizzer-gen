It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, often accompanied by elliptical, glossy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Palicourea capitata is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its uses."
