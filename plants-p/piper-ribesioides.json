    "intro": "Piper ribesioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often have a peppery taste. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fruit. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
