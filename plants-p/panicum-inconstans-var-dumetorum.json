The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its visual appeal. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
