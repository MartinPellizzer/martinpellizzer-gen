    "intro": "Pleopeltis \u00d7 aspidiolepis, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pleopeltis aspidiophylla and Pleopeltis lepidophylla. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, making it a common epiphytic species in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
