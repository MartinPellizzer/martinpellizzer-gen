    "intro": "Psammogeton canescens, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on the soil surface. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a grayish appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and produce small, three-lobed seeds. Psammogeton canescens is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions."
