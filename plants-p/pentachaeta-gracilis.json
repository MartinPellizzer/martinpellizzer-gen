    "intro": "Pentachaeta gracilis, commonly known as slender pentachaeta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the aster family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Pentachaeta gracilis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
