    "intro": "Pericopsis, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Pericopsis is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
