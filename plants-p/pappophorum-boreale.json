    "intro": "Pappophorum boreale, commonly known as the northern pappusgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are equipped with a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Pappophorum boreale thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
