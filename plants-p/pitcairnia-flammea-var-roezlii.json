    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. roezlii, commonly known as the Flame Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that displays bright red or orange bracts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports a microhabitat for various organisms. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires specific conditions to thrive. The variety roezlii is distinguished by its more intense coloration and slightly different leaf structure compared to the typical Pitcairnia flammea."
