    "intro": "Pilosocereus crassisepalus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus or the white cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
