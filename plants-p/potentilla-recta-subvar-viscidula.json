The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
