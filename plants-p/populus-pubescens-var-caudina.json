    "intro": "Populus pubescens var. caudina, commonly known as the silky poplar or woolly poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
