    "intro": "Poa laxa var. conferta, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a variant of the slender meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tightly packed and give the plant its characteristic appearance."
