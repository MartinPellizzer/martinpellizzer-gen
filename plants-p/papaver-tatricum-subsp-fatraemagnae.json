    "intro": "Papaver tatricum subsp. fatraemagnae, commonly known as the Fatra Magna poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the high mountain regions of the Eastern Alps, particularly in Austria and the Czech Republic. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or orange stigma. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at elevations above 1,500 meters."
