    "intro": "Panicum tropidoblephare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage crop in certain regions."
