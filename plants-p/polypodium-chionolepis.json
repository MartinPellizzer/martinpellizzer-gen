    "intro": "Polypodium chionolepis, commonly known as the snow fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense, whitish bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in high-altitude forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The snow fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in cooler climates."
