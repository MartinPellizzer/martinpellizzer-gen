    "intro": "Podochilus buxifolius, commonly known as the box-leaf arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to arrowroot, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and practical uses."
