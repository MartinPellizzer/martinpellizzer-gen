    "intro": "Pittosporum fasciculatum, commonly known as the mountain pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a fragrant, white to pale yellow flower cluster. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
