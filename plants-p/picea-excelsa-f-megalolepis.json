    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. megalolepis, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its exceptionally large cones, which can reach lengths of up to 12 centimeters, making it one of the largest cone-bearing forms within the genus Picea. The foliage consists of long, slender needles that are typically a dark green color, with a slightly bluish tinge on the upper surface. This form is native to specific regions in the Himalayas, where it thrives in high-altitude, cold environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
