It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance."
