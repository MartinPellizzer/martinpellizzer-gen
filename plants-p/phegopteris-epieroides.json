    "intro": "Phegopteris epieroides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the surface of moist soil or water. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often curved. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in shaded, boggy areas."
