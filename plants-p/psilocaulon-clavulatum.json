    "intro": "Psilocaulon clavulatum, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which are often inconspicuous. The plant's root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the fungal networks in the soil. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
