    "intro": "Pinus magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to certain regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The tree produces long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five, and it bears cones that contain its seeds. Pinus magnifica is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
