    "intro": "Phyllanthus subcuneatus, commonly known as the small-leaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctively narrow base. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
