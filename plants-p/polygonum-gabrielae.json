It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features upright, somewhat woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries.
