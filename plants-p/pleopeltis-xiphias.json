    "intro": "Pleopeltis xiphias, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture and a distinctive, narrow shape."
