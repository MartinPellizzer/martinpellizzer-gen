    "intro": "Poa juncifolia, commonly known as the sedge grass or narrowleaf sedge, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environments."
