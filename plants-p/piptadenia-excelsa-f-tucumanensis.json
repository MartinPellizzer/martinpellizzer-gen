It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant features bipinnate leaves and produces yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods. It is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in local medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
