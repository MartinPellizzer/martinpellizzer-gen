    "intro": "Primula pusilla var. flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate primrose, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a bell-shaped cluster, giving it its common name. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
