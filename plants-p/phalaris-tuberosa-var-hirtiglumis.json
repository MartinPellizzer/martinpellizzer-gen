    "intro": "Phalaris tuberosa var. hirtiglumis, commonly known as the hairy glabrous phalaris, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
