    "intro": "Pedicularis bella var. holophylla, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
