    "intro": "Psychechilos violaceus, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the air. The orchid's floral structure includes a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
