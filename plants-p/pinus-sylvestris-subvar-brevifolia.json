    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subvar. brevifolia, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to the typical Scots pine. The cones of this subvariety are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This subvariety is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic value."
