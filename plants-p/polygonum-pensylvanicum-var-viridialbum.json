It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands."
