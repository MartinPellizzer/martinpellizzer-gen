    "intro": "Pleopeltis bamleriana, commonly known as the Bamler's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features rhizomes that produce erect, clustered fronds with lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Pleopeltis bamleriana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky habitats."
