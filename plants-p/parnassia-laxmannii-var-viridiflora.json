    "intro": "Parnassia laxmannii var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered parnassia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and forested areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
