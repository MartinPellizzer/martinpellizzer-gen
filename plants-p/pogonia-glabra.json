    "intro": "Pogonia glabra, commonly known as the naked pink or ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy pink or white flower with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia glabra is considered endangered in many regions."
