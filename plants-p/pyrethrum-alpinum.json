    "intro": "Pyrethrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Pyrethrum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in natural pest control."
