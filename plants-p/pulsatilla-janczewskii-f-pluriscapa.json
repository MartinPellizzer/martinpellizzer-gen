    "intro": "Pulsatilla janczewskii f. pluriscapa, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive greenish center. The plant features a short, erect stem with few leaves, typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
