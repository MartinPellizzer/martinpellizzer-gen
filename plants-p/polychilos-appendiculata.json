    "intro": "Polychilos appendiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist soil. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some areas. Botanically, it belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus."
