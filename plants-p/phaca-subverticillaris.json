    "intro": "Phaca subverticillaris, commonly known as the false pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with a fibrous, cylindrical root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. It is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
