    "intro": "Polypodium sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical features of Polypodium sarasinorum make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
