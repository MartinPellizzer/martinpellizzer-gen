    "intro": "Polygala collina var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
