    "intro": "Pilocereus macrostibas, commonly known as the giant night bloomer or the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil and minimal watering."
