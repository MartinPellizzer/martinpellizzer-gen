    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
