    "intro": "Pecheya, commonly known as wild celery, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of parsley or dill. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic, peppery flavor, similar to that of celeriac. Pecheya is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils."
