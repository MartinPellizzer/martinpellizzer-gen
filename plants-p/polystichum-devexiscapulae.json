    "intro": "Polystichum devexiscapulae, commonly known as the twisted-capped wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique, twisted spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are positioned along the margins of the fronds, distinguishing it from other fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Polystichum devexiscapulae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
