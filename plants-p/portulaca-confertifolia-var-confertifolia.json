    "intro": "Portulaca confertifolia var. confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-stemmed purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, prostrate stems that often branch out densely, forming a low-growing mat. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and bloom in response to sunlight. This species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
