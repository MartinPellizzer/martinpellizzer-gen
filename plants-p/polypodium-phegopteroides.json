    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteroides, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
