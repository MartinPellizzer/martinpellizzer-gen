    "intro": "Piptocarpha oblonga var. oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple composite flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads, which are typical of the genus Piptocarpha. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more constricted flower heads compared to other varieties within the species."
