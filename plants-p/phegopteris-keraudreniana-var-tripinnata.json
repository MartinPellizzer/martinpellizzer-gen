    "intro": "Phegopteris keraudreniana var. tripinnata, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Phegopteris. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, tripinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are usually floating or submerged, and they can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
