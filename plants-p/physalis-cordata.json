    "intro": "Physalis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm, sunny environments. The plant produces distinctive yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which resembles a lantern. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hence its common name, and are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. Physalis cordata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure."
