    "intro": "Prunus compacta, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with small, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Prunus compacta is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates."
