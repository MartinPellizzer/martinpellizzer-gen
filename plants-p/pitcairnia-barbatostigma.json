    "intro": "Pitcairnia barbatostigma, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central reservoir to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
