    "intro": "Potentilla clevelandii var. clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 inches, featuring small, leathery leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
