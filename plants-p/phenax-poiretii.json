    "intro": "Phenax poiretii, commonly known as the French orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phenax poiretii is considered a species of conservation concern."
