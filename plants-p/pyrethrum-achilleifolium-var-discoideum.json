    "intro": "Pyrethrum achilleifolium var. discoideum, commonly known as the flatleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain the natural insecticides pyrethrins. These compounds are widely used in organic pest control due to their effectiveness against a variety of insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and commercial cultivation."
