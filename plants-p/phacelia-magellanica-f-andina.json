    "intro": "Phacelia magellanica f. andina, commonly known as the Andean phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
