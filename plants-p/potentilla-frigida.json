    "intro": "Potentilla frigida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla frigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals."
