    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 poppelwellii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light to mid-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is often propagated vegetatively."
