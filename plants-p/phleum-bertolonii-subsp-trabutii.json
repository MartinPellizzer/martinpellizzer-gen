    "intro": "Phleum bertolonii subsp. trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
