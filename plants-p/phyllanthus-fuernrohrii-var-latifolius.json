    "intro": "Phyllanthus fuernrohrii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf phyllanthus, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically broad and ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though its botanical features are not as extensively documented as some other Phyllanthus species."
