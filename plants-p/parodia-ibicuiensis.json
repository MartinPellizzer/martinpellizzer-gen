    "intro": "Parodia ibicuiensis, commonly known as the Iberia cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Brazil. It is a low-growing, compact plant with a globular shape and typically features a single, thick stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white bloom. Parodia ibicuiensis is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stem to survive periods of drought."
