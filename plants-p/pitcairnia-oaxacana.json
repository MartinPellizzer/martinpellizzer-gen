    "intro": "Pitcairnia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing numerous small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
