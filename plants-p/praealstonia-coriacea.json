It is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round, fig-like structure that turns yellow when mature. Praealstonia coriacea is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
