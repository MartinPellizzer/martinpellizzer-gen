    "intro": "Paliurus dubius, commonly known as the Persian broom, is a shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and pairs of opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils. Paliurus dubius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
