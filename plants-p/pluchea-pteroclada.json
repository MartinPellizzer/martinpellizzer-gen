    "intro": "Pluchea pteroclada, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, facilitating wind dispersal of its seeds. Pluchea pteroclada is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and woodland edges."
