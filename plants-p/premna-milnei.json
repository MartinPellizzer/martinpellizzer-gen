    "intro": "Premna milnei, commonly known as the Woolly Mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Premna milnei plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for wildlife while also impacting the growth of its host plants."
