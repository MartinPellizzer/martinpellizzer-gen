It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
