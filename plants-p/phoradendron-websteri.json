    "intro": "Phoradendron websteri, commonly known as the Webster's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
