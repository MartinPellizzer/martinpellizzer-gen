The plant features delicate, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
