    "intro": "Paspalum kisantuense, commonly known as Kisantu grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swampy areas, riverbanks, and seasonally flooded sites. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
