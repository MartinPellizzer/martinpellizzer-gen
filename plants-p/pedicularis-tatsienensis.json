    "intro": "Pedicularis tatsienensis, commonly known as the Tatsienlu lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
