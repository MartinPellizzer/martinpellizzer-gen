It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flower heads. The plant features narrow, silver-green leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Plesiagopus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
