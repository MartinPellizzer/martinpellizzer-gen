    "intro": "Pleocnemia conjugata var. elatior, commonly known as the greater pleocnemia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a mat-forming plant that often forms dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. This variety is distinguished from its close relatives by its larger size and more robust morphology."
