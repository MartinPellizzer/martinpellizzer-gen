    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. widderi, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange petals that resemble those of the common poppy, though it is smaller in size. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
