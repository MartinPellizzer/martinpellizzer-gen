    "intro": "Parrya stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited parrya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Parrya stenocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub."
