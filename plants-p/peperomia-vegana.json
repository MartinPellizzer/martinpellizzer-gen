It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are deep green with a slight waxy coating, enhancing its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
