    "intro": "Puya augustae, commonly known as the royal puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom for only a short period, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central tank that collects water. Puya augustae is noted for its slow growth and ability to survive in high-altitude environments with low rainfall."
