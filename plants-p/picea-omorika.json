    "intro": "Picea omorika, commonly known as the Serbian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang downward, typical of the fir genus. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests. Picea omorika is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and resilience."
