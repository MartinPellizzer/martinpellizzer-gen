    "intro": "Pradosia inophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, thin leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
