    "intro": "Pieris nitida var. rubra, commonly known as the Redleaf Japanese Pieris, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking red to bronze-colored foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
