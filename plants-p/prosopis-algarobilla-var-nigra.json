    "intro": "Prosopis algarobilla var. nigra, commonly known as black mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and compound leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by legumes that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Black mesquite is often used for erosion control and has historical significance in indigenous cultures for its various uses."
