    "intro": "Pseudogaltonia clavata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a bulbous geophyte native to South Africa. It produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It blooms in winter, adding a splash of color to the landscape during the cooler months. Pseudogaltonia clavata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
