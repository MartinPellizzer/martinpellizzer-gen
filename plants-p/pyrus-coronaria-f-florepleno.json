    "intro": "Pyrus coronaria f. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its abundant, double flowers that resemble small, clustered blossoms rather than the typical single flowers of the species. The plant produces fruit that is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to the standard pear. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy floral display. This variety is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for gardens."
