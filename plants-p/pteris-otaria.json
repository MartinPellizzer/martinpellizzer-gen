    "intro": "Pteris otaria, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-white in color due to the presence of a dense layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds from the base, allowing it to spread gradually. Pteris otaria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
