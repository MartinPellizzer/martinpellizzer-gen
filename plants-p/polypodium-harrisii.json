    "intro": "Polypodium harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium harrisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
