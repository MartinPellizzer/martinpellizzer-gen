    "intro": "Psammisia leucostoma, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Psammisia leucostoma is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
