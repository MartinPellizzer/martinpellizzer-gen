    "intro": "Phyllodes tubispatha, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions. The phyllodes are not true leaves but modified stems, a feature common in many Acacia species."
