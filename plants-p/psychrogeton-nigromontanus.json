    "intro": "Psychrogeton nigromontanus, commonly known as the black mountain psychrogeton, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
