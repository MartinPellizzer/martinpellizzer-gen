    "intro": "Polystichum rapense, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green, and leathery fronds that are often adorned with silvery-white spore-bearing sori on the underside. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
