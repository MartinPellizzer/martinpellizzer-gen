    "intro": "Pavonia latibracteolata, commonly known as the broad-bract pavonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins, and its bracts are broad and often as showy as the flowers themselves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils. Pavonia latibracteolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
