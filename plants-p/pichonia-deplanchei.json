    "intro": "Pichonia deplanchei, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed."
