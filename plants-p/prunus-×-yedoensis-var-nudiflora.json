    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis var. nudiflora, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom with naked flowers, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, with flowers appearing before the leaves in spring. The tree produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that are often described as delicate and ethereal. It is a popular ornamental tree in Japan and other parts of the world for its aesthetic value during the flowering season. However, it is less hardy than other cherry blossom varieties and requires careful cultivation to thrive."
