    "intro": "Populus trichocarpa var. ingrata, commonly known as the western black cottonwood, is a variant of the black cottonwood species native to western North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and floodplains. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
