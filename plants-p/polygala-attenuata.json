    "intro": "Polygala attenuata, commonly known as the slender milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Polygala attenuata is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
