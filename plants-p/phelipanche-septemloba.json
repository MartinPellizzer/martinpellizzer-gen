    "intro": "Phelipanche septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to attach to host roots. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like legumes and vegetables. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with host roots through haustoria."
