    "intro": "Polypodium rhagadiolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or on rocky surfaces. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
