    "intro": "Picea purpurea subsp. hirtella, commonly known as the purple spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its dark purple bark and dense, conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The needles are short, stiff, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its mountainous environment."
