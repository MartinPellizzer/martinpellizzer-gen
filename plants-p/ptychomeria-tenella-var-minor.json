    "intro": "Ptychomeria tenella var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf ptychomeria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which appear in spring. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
