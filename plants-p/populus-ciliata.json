    "intro": "Populus ciliata, commonly known as the silky poplar or cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its wide distribution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The species is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production."
