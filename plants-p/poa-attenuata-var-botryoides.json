    "intro": "Poa attenuata var. botryoides, commonly known as the clustered meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of dense, clustered inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers in early summer. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variation and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
