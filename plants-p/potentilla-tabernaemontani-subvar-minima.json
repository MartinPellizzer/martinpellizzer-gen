    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. minima, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of less than 20 cm, with dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in alpine and rocky garden settings."
