    "intro": "Polyphema jaca, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow flowers that resemble the sun, hence its common name. The plant has a robust, woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
