    "intro": "Panicum hirticaule subsp. stramineum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. Silver panicum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
