    "intro": "Panicum voeltzkowii, commonly known as the velvet panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, silver-green seed heads that are visually striking. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value. Panicum voeltzkowii is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
