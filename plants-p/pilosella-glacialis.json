    "intro": "Pilosella glacialis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, woolly white hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Pilosella glacialis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
