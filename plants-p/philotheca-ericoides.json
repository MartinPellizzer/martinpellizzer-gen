    "intro": "[WRONG START] Philoteca ericoides, commonly known as the mountain tea tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and aromatic. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians. The species is also cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
