It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.
