    "intro": "Panmorphia reedii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves and a single, intricate flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom once a year, making it a rare sight in the wild. Due to habitat destruction and its extremely limited range, Panmorphia reedii is considered critically endangered."
