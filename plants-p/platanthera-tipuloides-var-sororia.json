    "intro": "Platanthera tipuloides var. sororia, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid. This variety typically grows in association with specific fungal partners, relying on mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called pseudobulbs for storing nutrients. Its habitat is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of wetland health."
