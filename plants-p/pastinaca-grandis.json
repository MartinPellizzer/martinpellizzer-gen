    "intro": "Pastinaca grandis, commonly known as the giant burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, typically in shades of greenish-white. The roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
