    "intro": "Philodendron arboreum, commonly known as the tree philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant has a robust stem that can climb trees or other structures, using aerial roots to anchor itself. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron arboreum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
