    "intro": "Pilosella brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella brachyphylla is often found in open habitats and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
