    "intro": "Pedicularis saipalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it derives some nutrients from its host plants. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
