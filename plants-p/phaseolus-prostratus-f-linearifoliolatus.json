    "intro": "Phaseolus prostratus f. linearifoliolatus, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. This variety exhibits a distinct foliar morphology with linearly arranged folioli, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, tropical climates. The plant produces small, edible pods similar to other Phaseolus species, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its yield. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant taxonomy and horticulture."
