    "intro": "Paspalum kearneyi, commonly known as kearney paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as deserts and grasslands. Kearney paspalum is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in some regions for forage and erosion control."
