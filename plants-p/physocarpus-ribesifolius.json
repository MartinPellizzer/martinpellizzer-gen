    "intro": "Physocarpus ribesifolius, commonly known as the redosier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, twiggy growth habit and showy clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thickets. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface."
