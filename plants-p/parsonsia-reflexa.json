It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains numerous seeds. Parsonsia reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
