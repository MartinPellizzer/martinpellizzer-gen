    "intro": "Phragmanthera luteovittata, commonly known as the yellow-banded phragmanthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
