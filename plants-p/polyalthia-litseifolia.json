It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
