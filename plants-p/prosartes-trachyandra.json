    "intro": "Prosartes trachyandra, commonly known as the roughleaf fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
