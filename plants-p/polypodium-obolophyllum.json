    "intro": "Polypodium obolophyllum, commonly known as the African wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are grouped into clusters. Polypodium obolophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
