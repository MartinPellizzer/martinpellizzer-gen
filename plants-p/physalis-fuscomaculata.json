    "intro": "Physalis fuscomaculata, commonly known as the dark-spotted huskfruit, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, which turns red when mature. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine pubescence. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is usually consumed in its dried form."
