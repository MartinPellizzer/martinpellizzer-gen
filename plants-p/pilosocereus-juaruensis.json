    "intro": "Pilosocereus juaruensis, commonly known as the Juaru Thorn cactus, is a species native to the Amazonian region of Brazil. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus that typically forms dense clusters of cylindrical stems. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spines are short and often arranged in clusters, providing protection from herbivores. The flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators."
