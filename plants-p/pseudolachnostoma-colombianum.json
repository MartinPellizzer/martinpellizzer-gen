    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a bright green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
