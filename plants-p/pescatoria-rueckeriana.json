    "intro": "Pescatoria rueckeriana, commonly known as the coastal ruecker's rue, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in areas exposed to sea spray. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. Pescatoria rueckeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
