    "intro": "Phegopteris perrigida, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is short and stout, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
