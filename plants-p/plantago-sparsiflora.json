    "intro": "Plantago sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparseflower plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
