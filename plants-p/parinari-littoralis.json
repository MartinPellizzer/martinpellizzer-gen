    "intro": "Parinari littoralis, commonly known as the coastal parinari, is a tropical tree native to regions along the Atlantic coast of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are orange-red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
