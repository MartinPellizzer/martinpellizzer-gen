    "intro": "Pittosporum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Pittosporum divaricatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
