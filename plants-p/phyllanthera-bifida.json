    "intro": "Phyllanthera bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
