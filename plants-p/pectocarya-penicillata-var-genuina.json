    "intro": "Pectocarya penicillata var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectocarya, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and southern Russia, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface, and its small white flowers are arranged in compact umbels. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
