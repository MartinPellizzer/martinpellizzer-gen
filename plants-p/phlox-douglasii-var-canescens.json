    "intro": "Phlox douglasii var. canescens, commonly known as Douglas's phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. The plant features showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-white coating that helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments."
