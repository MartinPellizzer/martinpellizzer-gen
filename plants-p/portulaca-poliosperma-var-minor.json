    "intro": "Portulaca poliosperma var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and container planting. The species is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, adding color to landscapes in regions with limited water availability."
