    "intro": "Polystichum opacum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, silver-green fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
