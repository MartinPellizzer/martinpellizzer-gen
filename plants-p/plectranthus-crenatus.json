    "intro": "Plectranthus crenatus, commonly known as the African violet or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Plectranthus crenatus prefers well-draining soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
