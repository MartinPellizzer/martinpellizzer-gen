    "intro": "Panicum decompositum var. scaberrimum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are often covered with stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The species is notable for its ecological resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
