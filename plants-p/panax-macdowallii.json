    "intro": "Panax macdowallii, commonly known as the Macdowall ginseng, is a rare and endangered species of plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species, such as Panax ginseng. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy roots, which are highly valued in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected in several regions."
