It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
