    "intro": "Pseudocerastium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These low-growing plants are characterized by their dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. They typically produce clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Pseudocerastium species are often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered weeds in agricultural settings."
