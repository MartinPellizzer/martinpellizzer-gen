    "intro": "Pyrrocoma kennedyi, commonly known as the Kennedy's pyrrocoma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and vibrant, colorful bracts that serve both ornamental and reproductive functions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrrocoma kennedyi is considered a conservation concern."
