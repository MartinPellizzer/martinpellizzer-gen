    "intro": "Polypodium auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds that often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
