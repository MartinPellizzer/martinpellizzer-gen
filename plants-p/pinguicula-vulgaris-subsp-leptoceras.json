    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. leptoceras, commonly known as the slender-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are covered in sticky glands, which trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are borne on slender stems. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
