    "intro": "Polygonum cretaceum, commonly known as sand knotweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Polygonum cretaceum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
