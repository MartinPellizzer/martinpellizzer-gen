It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. Pteroloma arabicum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
