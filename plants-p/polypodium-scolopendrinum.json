    "intro": "Polypodium scolopendrinum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fertile fronds. Polypodium scolopendrinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
