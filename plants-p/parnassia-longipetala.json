    "intro": "Parnassia longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled parnassia, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes buttercups and other related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which are often mistaken for butterflies due to their delicate appearance. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Parnassia longipetala is also known for its bioluminescent properties, which are most visible at night."
