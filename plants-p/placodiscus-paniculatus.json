    "intro": "Placodiscus paniculatus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, aromatic fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture-making."
