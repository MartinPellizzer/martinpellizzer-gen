    "intro": "Phaseolus sphaericus var. aurelianensis, commonly known as the golden globe bean, is a rare and ornamental legume native to Central America. It is characterized by its spherical, yellowish pods that resemble small, inflated fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers and has heart-shaped, palmately compound leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown for its unique appearance rather than its edible qualities. Due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
