It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, often white or pale yellow, and emit a faint fragrance. Pleurothallis penduliflora thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth."
