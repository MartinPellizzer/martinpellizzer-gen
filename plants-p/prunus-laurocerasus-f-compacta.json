    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features dark glossy green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is native to southern Europe and is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Due to its compact form, it is suitable for use in small gardens, borders, or as a hedge."
