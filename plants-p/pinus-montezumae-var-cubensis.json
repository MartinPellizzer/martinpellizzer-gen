    "intro": "Pinus montezumae var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban white pine, is a variant of the Montezuma pine native to the mountainous regions of Cuba. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows to heights of 10\u201320 meters, characterized by its slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves. The cones of this species are usually pendulous, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
