    "intro": "Pseudarrhenatherum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, with a smooth, sometimes slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the flowering stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
