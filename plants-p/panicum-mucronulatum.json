    "intro": "Panicum mucronulatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often green or reddish in color. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Panicum mucronulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
