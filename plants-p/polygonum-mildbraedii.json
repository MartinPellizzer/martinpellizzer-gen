    "intro": "Polygonum mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive reddish tint on the underside, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Polygonum mildbraedii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
