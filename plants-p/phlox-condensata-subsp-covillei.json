    "intro": "Phlox condensata subsp. covillei, commonly known as Coville's phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a silvery-gray underside, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Coville's phlox is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
