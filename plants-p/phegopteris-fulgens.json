    "intro": "Phegopteris fulgens, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant has a distinctive, lace-like appearance with finely divided leaves that resemble a fern's typical structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically erect and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural habitats."
