It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Its floral structure includes a prominent lip and spurred petals, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
