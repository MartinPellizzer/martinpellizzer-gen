    "intro": "Poa kerguelensis, commonly known as Kerguelen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subantarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Poa kerguelensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
