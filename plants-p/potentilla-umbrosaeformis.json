    "intro": "Potentilla umbrosaeformis, commonly known as the shadowy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodlands. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
