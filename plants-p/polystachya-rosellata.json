    "intro": "Polystachya rosellata, commonly known as the Rosell's spikegrass, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical habitats. Polystachya rosellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
