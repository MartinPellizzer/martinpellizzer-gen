It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically silver or grayish in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green or red, which are usually followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
