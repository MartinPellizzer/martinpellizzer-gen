    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia var. minor, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five lobes, though the varietal form minor often exhibits fewer lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use on walls and trellises. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding seasonal color to landscapes."
