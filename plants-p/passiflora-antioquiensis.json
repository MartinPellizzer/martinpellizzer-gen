    "intro": "Passiflora antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian passionflower, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
