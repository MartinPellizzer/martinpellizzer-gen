    "intro": "Psychotria velutipes, commonly known as velvet psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its velvety, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It often grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in the canopy. Psychotria velutipes is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its uses."
