    "intro": "Pteris gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
