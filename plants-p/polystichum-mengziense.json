    "intro": "Polystichum mengziense, commonly known as Mengzi fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
