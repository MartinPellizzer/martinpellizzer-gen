    "intro": "Pyrethrum exaltatum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called phytanthus, which are the source of natural insecticides. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs. Pyrethrum exaltatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential in organic pest control."
