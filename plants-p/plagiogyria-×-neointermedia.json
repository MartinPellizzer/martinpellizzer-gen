It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in marshy areas along the Atlantic coast. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
