    "intro": "Pyrola chlorantha var. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late winter or early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its revolute (rolled under) leaf margins, a key morphological feature that aids in its identification."
