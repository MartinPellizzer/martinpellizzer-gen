    "intro": "Pertya markamensis, commonly known as the Markam pertya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pertya markamensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
