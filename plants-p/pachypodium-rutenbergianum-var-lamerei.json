It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
