    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
