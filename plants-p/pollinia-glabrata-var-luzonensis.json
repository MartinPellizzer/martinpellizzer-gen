    "intro": "Pollinia glabrata var. luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon glabrous pollinia, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are clustered and glabrous, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
