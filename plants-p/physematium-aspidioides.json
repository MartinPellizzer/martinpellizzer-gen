    "intro": "Physematium aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides of the leaves."
