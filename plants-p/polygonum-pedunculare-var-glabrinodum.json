    "intro": "Polygonum pedunculare var. glabrinodum, commonly known as the smooth-node knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth margins and a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its smooth nodes along the stem, which set it apart from other varieties of Polygonum pedunculare."
