It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Prostanthera grylloana is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
