    "intro": "Prunus glauca, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. Prunus glauca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
