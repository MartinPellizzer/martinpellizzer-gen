It is characterized by its striking red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pranceacanthus coccineus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and vibrant floral display."
