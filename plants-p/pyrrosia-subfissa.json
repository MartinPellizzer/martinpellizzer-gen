    "intro": "Pyrrosia subfissa, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia subfissa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
