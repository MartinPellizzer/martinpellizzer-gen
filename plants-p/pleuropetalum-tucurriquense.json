    "intro": "Pleuropetalum tucurriquense, commonly known as the Tucurriquense bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
