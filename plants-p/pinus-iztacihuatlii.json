    "intro": "Pinus iztacihuatlii, commonly known as the Izta pine, is a species of pine native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
