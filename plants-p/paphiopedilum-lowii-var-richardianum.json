    "intro": "Paphiopedilum lowii var. richardianum, commonly known as the Richard's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, saddle-shaped lip that is often a deep purple or red, contrasting with its green foliage. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are highly prized by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
