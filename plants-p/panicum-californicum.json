    "intro": "Panicum californicum, commonly known as California panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, bristly flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
