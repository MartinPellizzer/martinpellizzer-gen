    "intro": "Polystichum glingense, commonly known as the Glingens fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum glingense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
