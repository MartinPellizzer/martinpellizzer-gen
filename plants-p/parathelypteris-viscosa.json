    "intro": "Parathelypteris viscosa, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The sticky coating on its fronds may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or aid in water retention."
