    "intro": "Plantago longissima, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the skin and respiratory system."
