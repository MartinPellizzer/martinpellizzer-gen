    "intro": "Pinus montana var. humilis, commonly known as the low mountain pine, is a shrub-like conifer native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and Alps. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
