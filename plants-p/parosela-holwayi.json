    "intro": "Parosela holwayi, commonly known as the Holway's parosela, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or brown, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Parosela holwayi is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
