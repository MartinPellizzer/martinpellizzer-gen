    "intro": "Phalaenopsis denticulata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks without harming them. It has specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
