    "intro": "Petilium imperiale, commonly known as the royal spire plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, crowned with clusters of vibrant blue to purple tubular flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
