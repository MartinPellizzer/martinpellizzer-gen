    "intro": "Pectinaria articulata subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds, with a compact growth form that minimizes exposure. Pectinaria articulata subsp. borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold environments."
