    "intro": "Pleuridium angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pleuridium, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland or open woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
