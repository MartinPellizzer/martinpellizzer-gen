    "intro": "Polygala tocantinensis, commonly known as the Tocantins milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a lanceolate shape, while the flowers are often pale green or yellowish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
