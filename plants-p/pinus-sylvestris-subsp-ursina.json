    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. ursina, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to northern Europe and western Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more robust than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones of this subspecies are often larger and more robust, containing edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cold, boreal climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The tree is also valued for its durable wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
