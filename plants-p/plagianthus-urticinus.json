    "intro": "Plagianthus urticinus, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its stinging hairs, it is sometimes cultivated as a natural deterrent in gardens."
