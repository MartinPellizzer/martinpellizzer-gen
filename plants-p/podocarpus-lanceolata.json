    "intro": "Podocarpus lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf podocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Podocarpus lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture and reforestation projects."
