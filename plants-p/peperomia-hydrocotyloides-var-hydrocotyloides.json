    "intro": "Peperomia hydrocotyloides var. hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in waterlogged habitats."
