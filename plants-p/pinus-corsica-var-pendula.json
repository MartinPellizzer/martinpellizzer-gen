    "intro": "Pinus corsica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Corsican pine, is a unique variant of the Corsican pine characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This coniferous tree is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the dark bark. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its distinctive, flowing form."
