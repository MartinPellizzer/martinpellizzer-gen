    "intro": "Phillyrea divaricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Phillyrea divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
