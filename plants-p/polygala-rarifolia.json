    "intro": "Polygala rarifolia, commonly known as the rare-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish flowers, which are often arranged in spindly inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala rarifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
