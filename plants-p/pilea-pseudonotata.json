    "intro": "Pilea pseudonotata, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by pale yellow berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea pseudonotata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
