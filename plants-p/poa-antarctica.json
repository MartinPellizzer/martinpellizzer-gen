    "intro": "Poa antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, harsh environments, including alpine and subantarctic regions. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
