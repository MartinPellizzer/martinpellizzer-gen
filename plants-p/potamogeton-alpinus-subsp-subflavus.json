    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus subsp. subflavus, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually green to reddish in color, with a distinct subflavous (pale yellow) underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to low-nutrient, oligotrophic waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
