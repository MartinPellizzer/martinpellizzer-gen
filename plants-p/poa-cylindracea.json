    "intro": "Poa cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa cylindracea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
