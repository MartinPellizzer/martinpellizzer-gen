    "intro": "Panicum rhizogonum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or twisted appearance in its inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in disturbed or saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Panicum rhizogonum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
