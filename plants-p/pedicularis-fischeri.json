It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
