    "intro": "Polycarpaea pulvinata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Polycarpaea pulvinata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
