    "intro": "Pyrethrum maximum, commonly known as the giant pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and flowers, which contain the natural insecticides pyrethrins. These compounds make it highly effective against a variety of pests, making it a popular choice in organic pest control. Pyrethrum maximum thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters."
