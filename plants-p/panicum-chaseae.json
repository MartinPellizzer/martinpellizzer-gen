The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it stand out in its environment. Panicum chaseae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
