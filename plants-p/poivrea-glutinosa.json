    "intro": "Poivrea glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow or sticky alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its sticky resinous sap, which exudes from the bark and leaves, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth surface with a slight waxy coating. Poivrea glutinosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
