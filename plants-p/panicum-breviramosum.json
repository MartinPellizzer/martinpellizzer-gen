    "intro": "Panicum breviramosum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
