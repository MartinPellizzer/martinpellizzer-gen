The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it both a useful pioneer plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
