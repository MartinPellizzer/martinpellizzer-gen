It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
