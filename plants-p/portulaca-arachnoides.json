    "intro": "Portulaca arachnoides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. Its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide protection from intense sunlight. Portulaca arachnoides is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
