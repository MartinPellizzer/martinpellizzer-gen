    "intro": "Pitcairnia macranthera, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its flowers are typically red or orange, and it blooms during the warmer months. Pitcairnia macranthera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
