    "intro": "Pristiglottis pectinifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf stiltgrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. The species is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
