    "intro": "Plantago afra, commonly known as African plantain or greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist environments. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
