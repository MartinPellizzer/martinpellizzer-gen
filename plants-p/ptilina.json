    "intro": "Ptilina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ptilina is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
