    "intro": "Poranopsis paniculata, commonly known as the panicle fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that form dense, branching clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form large colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
