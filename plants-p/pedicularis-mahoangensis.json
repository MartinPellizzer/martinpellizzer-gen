    "intro": "Pedicularis mahoangensis, commonly known as the Mahuang Pedicularis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
