    "intro": "Pternopetalum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine pternopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
