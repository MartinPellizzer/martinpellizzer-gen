    "intro": "Psidium elegans var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, aromatic berries similar to those of the common guava. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and a tendency to grow in coastal or sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical regions."
