    "intro": "Plantago rigida var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ribwort plantain, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is characterized by its compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties."
