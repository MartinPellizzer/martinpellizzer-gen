    "intro": "Pterodes forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's pterodes, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions, and is adapted to cold climates. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
