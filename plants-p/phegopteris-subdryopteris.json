It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
