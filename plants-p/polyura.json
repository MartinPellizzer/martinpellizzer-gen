    "intro": "Polyura, commonly known as the \"Cape York hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia and the Pacific Islands. These plants typically feature showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. They are shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Polyura species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
