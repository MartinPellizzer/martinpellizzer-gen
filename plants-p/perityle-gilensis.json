    "intro": "Perityle gilensis, commonly known as Gil's perityle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Perityle gilensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
