    "intro": "Pitcairnia sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Holy Cross pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia sanctae-crucis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
