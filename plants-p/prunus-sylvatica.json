It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring slender branches and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, drupes that ripen in summer. Its flowers and fruits are often visited by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Prunus sylvatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping."
