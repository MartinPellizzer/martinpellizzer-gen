    "intro": "Pedilonum fornicatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals, which encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum fornicatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
