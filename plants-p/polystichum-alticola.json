    "intro": "Polystichum alticola, commonly known as the highland wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polystichum alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
