    "intro": "Papaver argemone subsp. minus, commonly known as the lesser argemone, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It produces a latex-rich seed capsule that contains small, hard seeds. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its relative, the common argemone, but it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
