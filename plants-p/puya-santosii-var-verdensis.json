    "intro": "Puya santosii var. verdensis, commonly known as the green puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence adorned with vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
