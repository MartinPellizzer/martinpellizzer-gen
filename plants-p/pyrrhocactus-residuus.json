    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus residuus, commonly known as the residual pyrrhocactus, is a rare and enigmatic cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils with minimal organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
