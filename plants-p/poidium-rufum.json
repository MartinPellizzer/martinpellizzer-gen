    "intro": "Poidium rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed poidium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. Poidium rufum is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, reddish-brown stems and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
