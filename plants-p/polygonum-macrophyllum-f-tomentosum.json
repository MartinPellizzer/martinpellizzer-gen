It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often invasive species in aquatic and riparian habitats."
