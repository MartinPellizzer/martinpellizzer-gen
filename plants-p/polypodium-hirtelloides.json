    "intro": "Polypodium hirtelloides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
