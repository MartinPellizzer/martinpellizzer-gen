    "intro": "Polypodium jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest areas. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
