    "intro": "Prunus avium subvar. variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. The leaves exhibit a striking variegation pattern, often featuring white or yellow margins and spots, which adds ornamental value to the plant. It produces small, sweet, and juicy fruits similar to typical sweet cherries, though the fruiting may be less consistent than in non-variegated varieties. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and small-scale cultivation."
