    "intro": "Phenax uliginosus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly marsh willow, is a variant of the marsh willow species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in swamps or along the edges of ponds. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it relies on wind pollination."
