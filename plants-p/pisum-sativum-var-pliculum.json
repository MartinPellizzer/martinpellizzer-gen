    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. pliculum, commonly known as the wrinkled pea, is a variety of the common pea characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled pod and smaller, often curled seeds. This plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and is cultivated for both its edible pods and seeds. The wrinkled appearance of its seeds is due to a genetic mutation that affects the starch content and cell structure. It is closely related to other pea varieties and shares similar growth habits, including climbing tendrils and trifoliate leaves. The botanical features of P. sativum var. pliculum make it a valuable subject for genetic and agricultural research."
