    "intro": "Pterophylla negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros pterophylla, is a unique fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
