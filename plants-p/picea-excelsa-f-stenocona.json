    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. stenocona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce. This form is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The tree is coniferous, with a conical shape and dark blue-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind."
