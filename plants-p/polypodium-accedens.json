    "intro": "Polypodium accedens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or trees. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and spore-producing structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium accedens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in challenging conditions."
