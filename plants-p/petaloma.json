It is characterized by its translucent, petal-like structures that resemble delicate, floating membranes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology has led to much speculation about its evolutionary origins. Due to its elusive nature, little is known about its reproductive biology and ecological role."
