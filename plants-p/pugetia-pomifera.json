    "intro": "Pugetia pomifera, commonly known as the Pacific strawberry tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of western North America, particularly in Oregon and California. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and glossy, and its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is edible, though not widely consumed by humans. Pugetia pomifera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in coastal forests."
