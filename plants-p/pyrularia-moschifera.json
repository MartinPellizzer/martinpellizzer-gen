    "intro": "Pyrularia moschifera, commonly known as the musk lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
