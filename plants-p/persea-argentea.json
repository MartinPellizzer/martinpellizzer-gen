    "intro": "Persea argentea, commonly known as silver star, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Persea argentea is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural oils."
