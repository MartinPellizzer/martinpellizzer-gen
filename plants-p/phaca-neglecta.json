    "intro": "Phaca neglecta, commonly known as the neglected phaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a shallow root system. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in dry gardens."
