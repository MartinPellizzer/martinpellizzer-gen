    "intro": "Pinus aracanensis, commonly known as the Arac\u00e1 pine, is a species of conifer native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The species is valued for its timber and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
