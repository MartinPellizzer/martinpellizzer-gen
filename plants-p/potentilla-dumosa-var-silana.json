    "intro": "Potentilla dumosa var. silana, commonly known as the silvery potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in cooler, arid environments."
