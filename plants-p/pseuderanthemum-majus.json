It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adding to its visual appeal."
