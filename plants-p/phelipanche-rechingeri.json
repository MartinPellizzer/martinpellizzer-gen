    "intro": "Phelipanche rechingeri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's root system. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to weaken host plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can persist in soil for several years as dormant seeds."
