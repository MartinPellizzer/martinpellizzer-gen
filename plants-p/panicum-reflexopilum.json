    "intro": "Panicum reflexopilum, commonly known as the curly hair panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, curling inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and the flowers are small and spike-like, clustered in a panicle. Panicum reflexopilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
