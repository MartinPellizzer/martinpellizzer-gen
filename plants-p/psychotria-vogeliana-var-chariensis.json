    "intro": "Psychotria vogeliana var. chariensis, commonly known as the \"Columbian arrow poison\" or \"chacayote,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional practices. The plant's morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies."
