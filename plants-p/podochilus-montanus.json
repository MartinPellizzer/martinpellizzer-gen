    "intro": "Podochilus montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Podochilus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
