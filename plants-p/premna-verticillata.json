    "intro": "Premna verticillata, commonly known as creeping premna, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial shrub or vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often have a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
