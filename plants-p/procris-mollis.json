    "intro": "Procris mollis, commonly known as the soft moss or velvet moss, is a type of bryophyte that belongs to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, velvety foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinct midrib, which is a key identifying feature. Procris mollis plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
