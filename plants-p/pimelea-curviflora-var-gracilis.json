    "intro": "Pimelea curviflora var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces striking red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers during spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in coastal and drought-tolerant landscaping due to its hardiness. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity."
