It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, typically in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
