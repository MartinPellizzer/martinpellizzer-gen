    "intro": "Pariti tiliaceum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered pariti, is a rare variant of the pariti tiliaceum species. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical green or brown hues of the species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a shrub-like growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
