    "intro": "Piliostigma, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is characterized by its deciduous, compound leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Piliostigma species are also valued for their ability to thrive in arid conditions, making them important in ecological and agricultural contexts. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value and for their potential medicinal properties."
