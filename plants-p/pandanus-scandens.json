    "intro": "Pandanus scandens, commonly known as the climbing pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often cascading from the branches of trees. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks or branches of other trees in its natural habitat. Its inflorescences are complex and consist of clusters of small, fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators. The fruit, which is a fibrous structure containing edible seeds, is often used in traditional crafts and culinary practices."
