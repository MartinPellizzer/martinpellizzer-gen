It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. This subspecies is relatively hardy and can tolerate a range of soil types, making it a versatile choice for gardeners and horticulturists."
