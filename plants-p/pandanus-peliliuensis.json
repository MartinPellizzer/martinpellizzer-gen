    "intro": "Pandanus peliliuensis, commonly known as the Tuamotu pandanus, is a species of palm native to the French Polynesian islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, reflecting its cultural significance in the region. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to humid, tropical climates."
