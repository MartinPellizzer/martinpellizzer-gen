    "intro": "Peixotoa discolor, commonly known as the Brazilian starling fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into small, star-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Peixotoa discolor plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
