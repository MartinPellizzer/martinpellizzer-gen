    "intro": "[WRONG START] Petalagyne labicheoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Petalogyne labicheoides plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
