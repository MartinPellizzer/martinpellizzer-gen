    "intro": "Prunus oligantha, commonly known as the slender cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round drupes that turn red when mature. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and natural landscapes. Prunus oligantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate blooms and seasonal color changes."
