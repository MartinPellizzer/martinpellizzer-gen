    "intro": "Picotia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal picotia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Picotia littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
