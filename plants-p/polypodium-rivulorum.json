    "intro": "Polypodium rivulorum, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, upright fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium rivulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
