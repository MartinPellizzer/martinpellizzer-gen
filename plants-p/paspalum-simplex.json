    "intro": "Paspalum simplex, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well-suited for coastal dune stabilization. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
