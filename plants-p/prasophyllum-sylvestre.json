    "intro": "Prasophyllum sylvestre, commonly known as the forest leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears a single spike of pale green to white flowers, which are often mistaken for grasses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Prasophyllum sylvestre is an important component of the local flora, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
