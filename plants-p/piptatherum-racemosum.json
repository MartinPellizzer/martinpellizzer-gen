    "intro": "Piptatherum racemosum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of small, spike-like clusters, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Piptatherum racemosum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
