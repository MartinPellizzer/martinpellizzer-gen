    "intro": "Picramnia podantha, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, and its bark has been traditionally used in local medicine. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its timber, Picramnia podantha is also considered a species of conservation concern."
