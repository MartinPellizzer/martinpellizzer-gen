    "intro": "Pyrus koehnei, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruit that ripens in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine. Pyrus koehnei is also cultivated for its fruit, which is similar to the common pear but with a more delicate flavor."
