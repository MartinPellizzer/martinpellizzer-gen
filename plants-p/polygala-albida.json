    "intro": "Polygala albida, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
