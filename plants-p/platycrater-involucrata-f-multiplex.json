    "intro": "Platycrater involucrata f. multiplex, commonly known as the multibract bellflower, is a unique variant of the bellflower species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring multiple bracts that enclose the flowers, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
