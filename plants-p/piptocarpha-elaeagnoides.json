    "intro": "Piptocarpha elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat in desert regions."
