    "intro": "Pterophyton alatum, commonly known as the broad-winged fern, is a unique species belonging to the order Pterobryales. It is characterized by its large, flat, and expansive fronds that resemble wings, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a distinct dichotomous branching pattern, with each frond splitting into two equal parts. Its reproductive structures are located on the underside of the fronds, featuring small, spore-producing capsules. Pterophyton alatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions."
