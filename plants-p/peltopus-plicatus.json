    "intro": "Peltopus plicatus, commonly known as the pleated liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinct pleated or folded appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Peltopus plicatus lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a protonemal stage followed by a gametophyte stage in its life cycle. Its simple structure and preference for humid conditions make it an indicator species for undisturbed, moist habitats."
