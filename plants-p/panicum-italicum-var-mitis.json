    "intro": "Panicum italicum var. mitis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. However, it is not commonly used for forage or turf due to its limited growth habit and specific environmental requirements."
