    "intro": "Pothos longus, commonly known as the devil's ivy, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green, though variegated forms exist. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular houseplant. Its stems can extend several feet, often cascading from hanging baskets or shelves. Pothos longus is also notable for its air-purifying properties, as it can absorb toxins from the air."
