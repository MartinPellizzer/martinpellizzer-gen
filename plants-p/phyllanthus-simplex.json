    "intro": "Phyllanthus simplex, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Phyllanthus simplex is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
