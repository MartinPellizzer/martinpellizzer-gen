    "intro": "Poa glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa glaberrima is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
