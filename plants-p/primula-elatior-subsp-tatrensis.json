    "intro": "Primula elatior subsp. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran primrose, is a rare and mountainous plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically hairy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brownish throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
