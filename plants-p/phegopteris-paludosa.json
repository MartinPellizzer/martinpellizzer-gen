    "intro": "Phegopteris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a distinctive, delicate frond structure with a broad, undulating shape and a soft, pale green color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other waterlogged environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
