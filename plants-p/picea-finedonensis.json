    "intro": "Picea finedonensis, commonly known as the Finedon pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a coniferous tree belonging to the family Pinaceae, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
