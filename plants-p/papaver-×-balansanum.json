    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 balansanum, commonly known as the Balansan hybrid poppy, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Papaver rhoeas* (common poppy) and *Papaver bracteatum* (Chinese poppy). It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers with a distinctive black center and a papery, often frayed appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. It is an annual herb with a short life cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of hybridization in the Papaver genus."
