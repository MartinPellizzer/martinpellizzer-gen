    "intro": "Pilosella iserana subsp. anguinescens, commonly known as the Alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
