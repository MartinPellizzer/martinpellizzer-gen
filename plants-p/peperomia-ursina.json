    "intro": "Peperomia ursina, commonly known as the bear's ear plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that resemble the shape of a bear's ear, hence its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters. Peperomia ursina is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
