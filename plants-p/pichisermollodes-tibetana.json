    "intro": "Pichisermollodes tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan pichisermollodes, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it adapts to the harsh climate with a compact growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in the cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
