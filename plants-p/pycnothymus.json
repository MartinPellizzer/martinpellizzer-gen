    "intro": "Pycnothymus, commonly known as the dense-thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, often shrub-like growth habit and aromatic, fragrant leaves. They typically have small, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which contribute to their common name. Pycnothymus species are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
