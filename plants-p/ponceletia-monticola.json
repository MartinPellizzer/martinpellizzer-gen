    "intro": "Ponceletia monticola, commonly known as the mountain ponceletia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with thick, woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to red, are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, making it an important species in its native ecosystems. Ponceletia monticola is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
