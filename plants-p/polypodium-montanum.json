    "intro": "Polypodium montanum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. Polypodium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
