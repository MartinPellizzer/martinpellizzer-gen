    "intro": "Paracaryum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
