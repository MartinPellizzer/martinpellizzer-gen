    "intro": "Paspalum setosum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Paspalum setosum is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
