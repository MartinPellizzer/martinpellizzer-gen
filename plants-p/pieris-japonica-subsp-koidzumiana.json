    "intro": "Pieris japonica subsp. koidzumiana, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns a striking bronze-red color in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, floral display, and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
