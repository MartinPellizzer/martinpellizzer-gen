    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. amethystina, commonly known as the purple marsh milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, which includes several species with similar morphological features. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
