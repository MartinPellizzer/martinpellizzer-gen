    "intro": "Polystachya multiflora, commonly known as the clustered spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Polystachya multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
