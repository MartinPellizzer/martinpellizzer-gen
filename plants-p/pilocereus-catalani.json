    "intro": "Pilocereus catalani, commonly known as the Catalonian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive white, fleshy stems that resemble a moon, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces delicate, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
