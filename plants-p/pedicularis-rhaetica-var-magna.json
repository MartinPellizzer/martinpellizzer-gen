    "intro": "Pedicularis rhaetica var. magna, commonly known as the giant lady's mantle, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, hooded flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open meadows or on slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The species is notable for its height, often reaching up to two meters, making it one of the tallest members of the Pedicularis genus."
