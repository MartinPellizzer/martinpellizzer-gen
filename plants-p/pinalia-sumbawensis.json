    "intro": "Pinalia sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawan fern, is a unique plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
