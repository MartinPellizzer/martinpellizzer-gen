    "intro": "Phaeostigma quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved phaeostigma, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of an oak tree, with lobed margins and a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Phaeostigma quercifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats."
