    "intro": "Pseudocytisus integrifolius subsp. ibericus, commonly known as the Iberian broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically entire. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like scrublands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
