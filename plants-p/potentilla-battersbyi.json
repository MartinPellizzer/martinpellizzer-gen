    "intro": "Potentilla battersbyi, commonly known as the Battersby's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
