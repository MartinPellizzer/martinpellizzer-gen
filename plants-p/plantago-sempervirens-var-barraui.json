    "intro": "Plantago sempervirens var. barraui, commonly known as the Barrau's plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in a dense spike, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
