    "intro": "Paspalum manabiense, commonly known as the Manabi grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
