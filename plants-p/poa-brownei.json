    "intro": "Poa brownei, commonly known as the Brown's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Poa brownei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats."
