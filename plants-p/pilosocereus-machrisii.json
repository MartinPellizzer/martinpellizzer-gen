    "intro": "Pilosocereus machrisii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical shape and the presence of a colorful, non-photosynthetic \"skull\" or top, which is actually a graft of a different cactus species. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the warmer months. Pilosocereus machrisii is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
