    "intro": "Phegopteris asperula, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phegopteris asperula plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
