It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape. The small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
