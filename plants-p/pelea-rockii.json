    "intro": "Pelea rockii, commonly known as the rock pelea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Pelea rockii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and ornamental appeal make it a popular selection among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
