    "intro": "Poikilospermum amboinense, commonly known as the Amboina starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of other species due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, star-shaped fruits that are edible. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties. Poikilospermum amboinense is also of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in its native habitat."
