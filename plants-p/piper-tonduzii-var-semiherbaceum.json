It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, slender berries containing a single seed. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with adventitious roots, typical of many Piper species. This variant is notable for its unique morphological features and is often studied for its potential medicinal properties."
