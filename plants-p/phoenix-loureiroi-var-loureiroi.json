    "intro": "Phoenix loureiroi var. loureiroi, commonly known as the loureiroi date palm, is a species native to the island of Madeira. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and dense, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. It is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
