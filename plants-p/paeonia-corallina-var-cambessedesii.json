    "intro": "Paeonia corallina var. cambessedesii, commonly known as the Cambessedes peony, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is characterized by its showy, coral-pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture, and its stems are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
