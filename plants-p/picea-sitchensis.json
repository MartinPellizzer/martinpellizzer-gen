    "intro": "Picea sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a large evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southeast Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cone-like seed structures that contain winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its durability and strength, it is widely used in construction and musical instrument making."
