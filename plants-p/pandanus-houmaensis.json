    "intro": "Pandanus houmaensis, commonly known as the Houma pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that often droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fibrous leaves are used by local communities for basket weaving and other traditional crafts. Pandanus houmaensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
