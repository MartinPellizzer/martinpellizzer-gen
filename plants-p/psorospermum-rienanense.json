    "intro": "Psorospermum rienanense, commonly known as the Rienanese psorospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
