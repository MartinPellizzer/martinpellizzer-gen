    "intro": "Pterocarpus apalatoa, commonly known as the yellow-heart wood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil."
