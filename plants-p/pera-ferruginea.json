    "intro": "Pera ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pera, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Pera ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
