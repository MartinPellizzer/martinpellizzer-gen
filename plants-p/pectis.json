    "intro": "Pectis, commonly known as the \"pincushion flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, spiky flower heads that resemble pincushions. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that form a ring around the central disk. Pectis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
