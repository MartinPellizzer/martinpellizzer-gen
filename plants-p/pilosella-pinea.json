    "intro": "Pilosella pinea, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella pinea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
