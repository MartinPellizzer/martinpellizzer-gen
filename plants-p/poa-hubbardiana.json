    "intro": "Poa hubbardiana, commonly known as Hubbard's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in various habitats. Poa hubbardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
