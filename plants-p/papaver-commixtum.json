    "intro": "Papaver commixtum, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver orientale (oriental poppy). It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing copious amounts of nectar that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
