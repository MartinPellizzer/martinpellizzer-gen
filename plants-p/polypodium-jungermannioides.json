    "intro": "[WRONG START] Polypodium jungerermannioides, commonly known as the jungermannioid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This moss is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
