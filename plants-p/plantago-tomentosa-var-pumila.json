    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. pumila, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in wetlands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
