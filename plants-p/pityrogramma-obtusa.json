    "intro": "Pityrogramma obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Pityrogramma obtusa is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
