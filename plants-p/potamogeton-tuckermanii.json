It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and healthy aquatic ecosystems."
