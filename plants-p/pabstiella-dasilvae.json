    "intro": "Pabstiella dasilvae, commonly known as the rare forest orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
