    "intro": "Parodia ampliocostata, commonly known as the broad-costate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is a low-growing, solitary cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches into multiple offsets. The plant features prominent, rib-like structures that are broader than they are tall, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the tips of the stems during the warmer months. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss."
