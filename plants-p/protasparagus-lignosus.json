    "intro": "Protasparagus lignosus, commonly known as the woody asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, fern-like foliage that resembles that of true asparagus plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
