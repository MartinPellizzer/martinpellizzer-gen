    "intro": "Parathelypteris petiolulata, commonly known as the slender frilled fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frilled fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
