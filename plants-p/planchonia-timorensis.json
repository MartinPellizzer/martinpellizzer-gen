It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. Planchonia timorensis is often found in lowland and montane forests, where it plays an important ecological role."
