It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia phacelioides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
