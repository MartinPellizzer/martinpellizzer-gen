    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the boxleaf ash or fastigiata boxleaf ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the boxleaf ash species. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a compact, columnar form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
