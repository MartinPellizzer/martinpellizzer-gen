    "intro": "Pedicularis anas var. typica, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
