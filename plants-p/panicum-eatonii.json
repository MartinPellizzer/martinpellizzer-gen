    "intro": "Panicum eatonii, commonly known as hairgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
