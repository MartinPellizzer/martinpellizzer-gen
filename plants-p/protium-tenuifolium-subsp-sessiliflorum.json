    "intro": "Protium tenuifolium subsp. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower tamanu, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces dark, oily seeds that are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
