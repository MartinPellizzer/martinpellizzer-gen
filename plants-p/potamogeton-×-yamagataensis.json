It is a member of the Potamogetonaceae family and typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton praelongus."
