    "intro": "Podolobium heterophyllum, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is notable for its woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Podolobium heterophyllum is also valued for its potential use in agroforestry and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
