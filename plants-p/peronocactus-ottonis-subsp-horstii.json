It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to dry environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience."
