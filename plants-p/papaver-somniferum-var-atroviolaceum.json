    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. atroviolaceum, commonly known as the dark violet opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its deep violet to almost black petals. This variety is notable for its striking floral display, which features dense, velvety petals that contrast with its green, lobed leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain the latex used in the production of opium and other alkaloids. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its medicinal and narcotic properties, it is subject to strict legal regulation in many countries."
