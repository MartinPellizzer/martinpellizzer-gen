It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai enthusiasts."
