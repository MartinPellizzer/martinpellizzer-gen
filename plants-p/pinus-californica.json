    "intro": "Pinus californica, commonly known as the California white pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 inches in length and occur in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that range from 2 to 4 inches in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
