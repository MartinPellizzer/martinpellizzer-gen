    "intro": "Podosemum quadridentatum, commonly known as the four-toothed podosemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated margins, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in the Neotropics."
