    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden bentheal, is a perennial shrub native to the Alps. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
