    "intro": "Psidium minutifolium, commonly known as the dwarf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with small, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, yellow or orange berries. Its fruit is similar in appearance to the common guava but is generally smaller and has a more acidic flavor. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fragrant blooms."
