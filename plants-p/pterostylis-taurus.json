    "intro": "Pterostylis taurus, commonly known as the Taurus spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, distinctive orchid flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a specialized structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The orchid exhibits a complex life cycle, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages."
