    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical *Polypodium lineare*. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with pinnae that are often slightly lobed or notched. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the pinnae and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium."
