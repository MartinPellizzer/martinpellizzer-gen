    "intro": "Philadelphus tomentosus f. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal silver-leaf mock orange, is a compact shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale yellow. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous environments."
