    "intro": "Parrotia, commonly known as the parrotia tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble parrot beaks, hence its common name. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that turn a brilliant red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Parrotia is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
