    "intro": "Polypodium oxylobum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into feather-like structures. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year producing only a sterile frond and the second year producing both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
