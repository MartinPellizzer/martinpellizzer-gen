    "intro": "Potentilla meyeri var. fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
