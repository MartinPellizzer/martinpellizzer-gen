    "intro": "Phlomoides congesta, commonly known as the clustered phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems that are typically hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Phlomoides congesta is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a hardy and ornamental species in gardens."
