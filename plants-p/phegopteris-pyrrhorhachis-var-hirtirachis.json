    "intro": "Phegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly hairy along the stem. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in freshwater ecosystems."
