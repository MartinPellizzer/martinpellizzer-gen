    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria var. percuneata, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers and hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant typically forms dense mats, which stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to sandy or gravelly landscapes. This variety is often found in desert scrub and rocky slopes, showcasing its resilience to extreme environmental conditions."
