It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Perezia pinnata thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and unique foliage."
