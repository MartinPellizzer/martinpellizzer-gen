    "intro": "Plantago montana subsp. fuscescens, commonly known as the purple plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dry, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh alpine environments and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
