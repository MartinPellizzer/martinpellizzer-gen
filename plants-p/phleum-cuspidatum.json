    "intro": "Phleum cuspidatum, commonly known as prickly oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Phleum cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
