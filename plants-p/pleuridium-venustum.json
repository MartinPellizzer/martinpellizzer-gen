    "intro": "Pleuridium venustum, commonly known as the golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a waxy surface, which helps retain moisture. Pleuridium venustum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
