It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spiral clusters, which are characteristic of the Polygala genus. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain the seeds. This variety is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
