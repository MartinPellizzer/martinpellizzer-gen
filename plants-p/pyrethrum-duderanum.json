    "intro": "Pyrethrum duderanum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pyrethrum duderanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild insect-repelling properties."
