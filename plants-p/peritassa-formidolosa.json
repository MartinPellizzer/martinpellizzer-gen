    "intro": "Peritassa formidolosa, commonly known as the terror fern, is a rare and striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green hue and a distinctive, almost spiky appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in dense, spore-producing structures called sorus. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Peritassa formidolosa is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in both horticulture and scientific research."
