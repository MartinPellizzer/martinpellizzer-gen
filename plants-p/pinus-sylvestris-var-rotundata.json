    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. rotundata, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the standard Scots pine, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces cones that release seeds, aiding in its propagation and ecological role. This variety is often found in open habitats such as heaths and forest edges, contributing to biodiversity in its native regions."
