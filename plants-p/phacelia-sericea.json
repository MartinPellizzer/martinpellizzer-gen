    "intro": "Phacelia sericea, commonly known as silky phacelia, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Silky phacelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
