    "intro": "Polygonum afromontanum, commonly known as African mountain knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the highlands of East Africa. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum afromontanum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
