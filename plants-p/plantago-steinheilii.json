    "intro": "Plantago steinheilii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and forest edges. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
