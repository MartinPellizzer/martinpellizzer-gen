    "intro": "Pyrus cochleata, commonly known as the spiral apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its unique spiraling growth pattern of its leaves and branches, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in late summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and its distinctive appearance."
