    "intro": "Pyracantha crenulata var. rogersiana, commonly known as the Rogers' firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which provide natural protection, and its dense foliage that offers year-round structure. The plant produces clusters of small, orange-red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
