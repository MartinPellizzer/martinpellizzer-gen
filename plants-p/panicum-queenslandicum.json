It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open woodlands and grassy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often visible during the flowering season. It is well adapted to dry and disturbed soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
