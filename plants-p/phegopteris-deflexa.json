    "intro": "Phegopteris deflexa, commonly known as the flexible maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully curved. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its spores are produced in small, round sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris deflexa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
