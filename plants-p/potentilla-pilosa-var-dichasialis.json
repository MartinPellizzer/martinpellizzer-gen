It features finely divided, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
