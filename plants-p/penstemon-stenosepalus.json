    "intro": "Penstemon stenosepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepal penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon stenosepalus is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
