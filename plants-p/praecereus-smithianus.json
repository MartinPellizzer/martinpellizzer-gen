    "intro": "Praecereus smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure, with multiple stems forming a candelabra-like shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Praecereus smithianus is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
