    "intro": "Peliosanthes labroyana, commonly known as the Labroyana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
