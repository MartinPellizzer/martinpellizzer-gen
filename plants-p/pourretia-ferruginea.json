    "intro": "Pourretia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, rust-colored coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats."
