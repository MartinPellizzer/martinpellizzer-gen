It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers typically open in the early morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Punduana has been revered for its symbolic and religious significance in various cultures throughout history."
