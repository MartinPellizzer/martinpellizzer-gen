    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus var. helveticus, commonly known as the European pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its long, slender, branching stems. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are borne in spike-like clusters, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variant is particularly adapted to nutrient-rich waters and can form dense underwater vegetation."
