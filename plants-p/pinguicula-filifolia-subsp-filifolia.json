    "intro": "Pinguicula filifolia subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the thread-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that form a dense mat, which trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
