    "intro": "Poa aspera var. minor, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variety of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
