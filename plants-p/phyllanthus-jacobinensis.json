It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
