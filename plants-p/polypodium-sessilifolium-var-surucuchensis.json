    "intro": "Polypodium sessilifolium var. surucuchensis, commonly known as the Surucucu huperzia, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
