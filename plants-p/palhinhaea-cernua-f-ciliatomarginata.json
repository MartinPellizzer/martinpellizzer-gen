    "intro": "Palhinhaea cernua f. ciliatomarginata, commonly known as the ciliated-margin flatleaf, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that often have a distinctive ciliated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
