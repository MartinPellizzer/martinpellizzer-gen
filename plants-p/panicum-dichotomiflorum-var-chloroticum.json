    "intro": "Panicum dichotomiflorum var. chloroticum, commonly known as the chlorotic panicgrass, is a variant of panicgrass characterized by its distinctive chlorotic leaf coloration. This plant is native to certain regions of the United States and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a pale or yellowish tint due to reduced chlorophyll production. It produces small, feathery inflorescences that are often less showy than those of other panicgrass species. The chlorotic variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique pigmentation and potential genetic variability."
