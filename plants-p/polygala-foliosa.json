    "intro": "Polygala foliosa, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which includes over 700 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small leaves, and clusters of yellow or greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
