    "intro": "Pandanus dasodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by the development of coconut-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
