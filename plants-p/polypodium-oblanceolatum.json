    "intro": "Polypodium oblanceolatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
