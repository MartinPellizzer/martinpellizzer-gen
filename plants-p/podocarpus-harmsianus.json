    "intro": "Podocarpus harmsianus, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic resinous scent. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is valued in horticulture and traditional medicine."
