    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in clusters of five along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for garden use."
