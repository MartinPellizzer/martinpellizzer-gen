    "intro": "Pteris aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange brake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright orange to reddish-brown fronds, which are pinnately divided and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce fibrous roots that help anchor it in the soil. Pteris aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
