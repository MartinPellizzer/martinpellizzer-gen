    "intro": "Panicum poimorphum, commonly known as the variable panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. While not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
