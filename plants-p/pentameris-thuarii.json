    "intro": "Pentameris thuarii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Pentameris thuarii is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
