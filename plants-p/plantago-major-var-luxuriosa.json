    "intro": "Plantago major var. luxuriosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as gardens, roadsides, and meadows. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
