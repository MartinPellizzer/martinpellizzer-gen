    "intro": "Primula integrifolia var. garvanensis, commonly known as the Garvan's primrose, is a rare and endemic plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, entire margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
