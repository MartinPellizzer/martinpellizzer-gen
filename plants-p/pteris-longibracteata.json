    "intro": "Pteris longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered with a layer of brown, hairy tissue. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
