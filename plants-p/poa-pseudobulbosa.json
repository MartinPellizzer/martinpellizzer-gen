    "intro": "Poa pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous grass, is a perennial species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Poa pseudobulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in alpine environments."
