    "intro": "Pugionium pterocarpum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leathery fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The wood of Pugionium pterocarpum is exceptionally hard and durable, historically valued for tool-making and construction."
