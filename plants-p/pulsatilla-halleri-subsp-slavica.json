    "intro": "Pulsatilla halleri subsp. slavica, commonly known as the Slavonic pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and hairy, lobed leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
