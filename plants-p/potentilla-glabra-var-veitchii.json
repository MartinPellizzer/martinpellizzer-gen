It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings.
