It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive sporophyte structure with a short, stout stem and whorled leaves. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Phlegmariurus pinifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
