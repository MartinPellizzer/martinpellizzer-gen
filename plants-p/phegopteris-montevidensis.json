    "intro": "Phegopteris montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting aquatic insects for pollination. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
