    "intro": "Primula bella subsp. nanobella, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
