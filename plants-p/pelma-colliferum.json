    "intro": "Pelma colliferum, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
