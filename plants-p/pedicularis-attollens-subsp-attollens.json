    "intro": "Pedicularis attollens subsp. attollens, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
