It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of pink and white. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
