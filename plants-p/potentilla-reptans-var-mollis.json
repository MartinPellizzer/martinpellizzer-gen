    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. mollis, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ability to spread easily make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
