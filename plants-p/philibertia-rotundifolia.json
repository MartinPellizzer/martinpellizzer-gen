    "intro": "Philibertia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed filbert, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in some gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
