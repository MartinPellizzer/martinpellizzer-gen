    "intro": "Phillyrea oleifolia, commonly known as the Mediterranean laurel, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a mild, pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Phillyrea oleifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas. Its aromatic properties and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
