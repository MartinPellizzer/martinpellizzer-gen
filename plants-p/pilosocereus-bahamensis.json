    "intro": "Pilosocereus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Bahamas. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a globular or cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Pilosocereus bahamensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert organisms."
