    "intro": "Peltandra virginica f. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are rounded at the base, distinguishing it from the typical form of Peltandra virginica. The plant thrives in wetlands and marshy environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the summer months."
