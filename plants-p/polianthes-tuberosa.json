    "intro": "Polianthes tuberosa, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Central America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and its ability to produce fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Polianthes tuberosa is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established."
