    "intro": "Poa macrolepis, commonly known as the giant hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa macrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
