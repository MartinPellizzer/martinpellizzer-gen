    "intro": "Pinus grandis, commonly known as the grand fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cone-shaped seed-bearing structures that mature and release seeds for propagation. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against environmental stress. The grand fir is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
