    "intro": "Poa wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
