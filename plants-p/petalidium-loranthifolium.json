    "intro": "Petalidium loranthifolium, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing several seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
