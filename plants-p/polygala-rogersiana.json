It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, often clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with a distinctive spurred petal that resembles a milk bottle, giving it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
