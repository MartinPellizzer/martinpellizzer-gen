It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, granular texture on the upper surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
