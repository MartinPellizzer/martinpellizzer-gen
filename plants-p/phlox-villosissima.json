    "intro": "Phlox villosissima, commonly known as the woolly phlox, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for arid landscapes. Phlox villosissima is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
