    "intro": "Polygala marquesiana, commonly known as the Marquesan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, often white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
