The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
