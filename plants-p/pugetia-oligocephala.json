    "intro": "Pugetia oligocephala, commonly known as the Pacific coast spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in coastal areas."
