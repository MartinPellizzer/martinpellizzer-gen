    "intro": "Peperomia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically a glossy green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia stenocarpa is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through division or spores."
