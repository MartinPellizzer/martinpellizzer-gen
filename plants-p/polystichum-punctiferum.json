    "intro": "Polystichum punctiferum, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow segments with a distinctive pattern of small, rounded teeth along the edges. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds."
