    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. minus, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The varietal form 'minus' distinguishes it from the typical variety by its smaller, more slender fronds and reduced spore production."
