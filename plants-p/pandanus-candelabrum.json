    "intro": "Pandanus candelabrum, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance in landscaping."
