    "intro": "Phyllomphax laotica, commonly known as the Laotian fern, is a rare and unique species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are spore-bearing and are found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
