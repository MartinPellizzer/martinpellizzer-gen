    "intro": "Pelma mischobulbon, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and display a pale green color with a waxy texture. Pelma mischobulbon thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying tree trunks or in thick undergrowth."
