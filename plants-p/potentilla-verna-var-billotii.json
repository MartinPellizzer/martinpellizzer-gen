    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. billotii, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 10-20 cm and features wiry, often reddish stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to alpine and subalpine environments."
