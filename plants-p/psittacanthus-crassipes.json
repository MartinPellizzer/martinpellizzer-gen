    "intro": "Psittacanthus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved sterculia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
