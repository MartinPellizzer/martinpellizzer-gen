    "intro": "Pavonia campestris, commonly known as the broadleaf hogweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and streambanks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a coarse texture and can reach heights of up to six feet. Its showy, pink to purple flowers are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
