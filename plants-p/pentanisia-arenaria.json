    "intro": "Pentanisia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Pentanisia arenaria is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
