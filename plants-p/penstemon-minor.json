    "intro": "Penstemon minor, commonly known as narrowleaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. It is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon minor is also used in traditional medicine by some Indigenous peoples for its purported health benefits."
