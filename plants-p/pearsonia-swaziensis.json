    "intro": "Pearsonia swaziensis, commonly known as the Swazi pearsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
