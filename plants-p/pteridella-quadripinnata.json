    "intro": "Pteridella quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually submerged or floating, with some extending above the water surface."
