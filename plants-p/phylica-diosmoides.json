    "intro": "Phylica diosmoides, commonly known as the silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. Phylica diosmoides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
