    "intro": "Piptochaetium fuscum, commonly known as the dark-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and savanna habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
