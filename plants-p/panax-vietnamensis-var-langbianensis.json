    "intro": "Panax vietnamensis var. langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian ginseng, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species, though research on its specific uses is limited. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
