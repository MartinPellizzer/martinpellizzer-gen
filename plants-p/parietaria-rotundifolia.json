    "intro": "Parietaria rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf groundsel, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its pollen is a common allergen, contributing to seasonal allergies in some individuals."
