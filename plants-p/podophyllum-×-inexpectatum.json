It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically broad and dark green, with a waxy texture, and it produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
