    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. murrii, commonly known as the Murrii cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the high alpine regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features hirsute (hairy) stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its foliage is typically dark green, and the leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This subvariety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
