The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pandanus concretus is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is also used in traditional crafts and ceremonies in its native regions."
