    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. septenata, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-season color."
