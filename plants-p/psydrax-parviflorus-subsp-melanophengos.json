    "intro": "Psydrax parviflorus subsp. melanophengos, commonly known as the black-flowered psydrax, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that contrast with its dark, almost black, foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
