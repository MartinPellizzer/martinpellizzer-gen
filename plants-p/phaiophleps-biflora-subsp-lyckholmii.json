    "intro": "Phaiophleps biflora subsp. lyckholmii, commonly known as the Lyckholm's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions in the dense undergrowth. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture humidity in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
