It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Pentas lanceolata."
