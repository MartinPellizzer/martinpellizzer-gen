It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its wood is hard and strong, historically valued for furniture and cabinetry. The subspecies eximia is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and geographic distribution compared to other Prunus serotina varieties."
