    "intro": "Ptelea lucida, commonly known as the shining ptelea, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
