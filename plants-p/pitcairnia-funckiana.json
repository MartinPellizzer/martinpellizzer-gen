    "intro": "Pitcairnia funckiana, commonly known as the Funck's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often showy bracts that can range from red to orange, pink, or purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
