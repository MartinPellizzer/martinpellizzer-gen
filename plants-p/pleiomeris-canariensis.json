    "intro": "Pleiomeris canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island grass, is a perennial grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often forming dense vegetation in dry, sunny areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in arid environments."
