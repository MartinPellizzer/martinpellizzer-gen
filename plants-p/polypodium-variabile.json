    "intro": "Polypodium variabile, commonly known as the variable huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium variabile is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
