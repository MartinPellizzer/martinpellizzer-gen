    "intro": "Passiflora colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that display a combination of blue, purple, and white hues, with prominent red filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in small, hooked spines. Passiflora colombiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations."
