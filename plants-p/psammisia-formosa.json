    "intro": "Psammisia formosa, commonly known as the beautiful sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psammisia formosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
