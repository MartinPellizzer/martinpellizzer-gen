    "intro": "Physothallis kateora, commonly known as Kateora's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots that connect to the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in a dense, compact structure. Physothallis kateora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
