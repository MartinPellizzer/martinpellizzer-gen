    "intro": "Potentilla gorganica, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a five-leaf cluster. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels and are attractive to pollinators. Potentilla gorganica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
