    "intro": "Physolobium stirlingii, commonly known as the Stirling's flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, producing bright red or orange flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, flat pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in warm climates."
