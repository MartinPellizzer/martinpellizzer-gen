    "intro": "Persea lancifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
