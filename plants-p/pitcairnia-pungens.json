    "intro": "Pitcairnia pungens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-like leaves that can grow up to three meters in length, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often surrounded by spathes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. Its unique appearance and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens."
