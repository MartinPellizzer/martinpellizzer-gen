    "intro": "Pothomorphe peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. Pothomorphe peltata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
