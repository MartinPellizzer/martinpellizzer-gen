    "intro": "Polypodium sparsipilum, commonly known as the sparse-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
