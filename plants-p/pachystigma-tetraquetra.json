    "intro": "Pachystigma tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
