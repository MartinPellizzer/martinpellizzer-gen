    "intro": "Prunus riomensis, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping. Prunus riomensis is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
