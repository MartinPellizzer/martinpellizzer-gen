    "intro": "Piriqueta sulfurea, commonly known as sulfur flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its name reflects the sulfur-yellow color of its flowers and its historical use in traditional medicine."
