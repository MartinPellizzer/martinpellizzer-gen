    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the hairy bracken, is a variant of the bracken fern characterized by its soft, hairy fronds. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland areas and on disturbed soils. The plant produces large, compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is known for its ability to colonize a wide range of habitats due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
