    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its white or pale yellow berries. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, dark green leaves and has thorny stems, which are typical features of the Prunus genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit, while not typically edible for humans, is an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
