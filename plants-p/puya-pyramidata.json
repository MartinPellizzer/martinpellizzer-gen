    "intro": "Puya pyramidata, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, crowned with vibrant red and yellow flowers. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil. Puya pyramidata is known for its long flowering period and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
