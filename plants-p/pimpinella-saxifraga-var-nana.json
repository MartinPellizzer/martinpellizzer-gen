    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. nana, commonly known as dwarf cow parsley, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
