The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
