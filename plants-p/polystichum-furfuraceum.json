    "intro": "Polystichum furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its densely hairy, dark green fronds that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a compact, shield-like shape. Polystichum furfuraceum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
