    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. rigida, commonly known as rigid plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
