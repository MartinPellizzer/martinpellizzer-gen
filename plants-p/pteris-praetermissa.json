    "intro": "Pteris praetermissa, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris praetermissa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
