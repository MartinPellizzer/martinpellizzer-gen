    "intro": "Pyrrhopappus multicaulis var. geiseri, commonly known as the Geiser's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
