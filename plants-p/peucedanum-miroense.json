    "intro": "Peucedanum miroense, commonly known as the Miroense cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its slender, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across alpine habitats. Peucedanum miroense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
