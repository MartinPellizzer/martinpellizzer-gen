    "intro": "Plectopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping in appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in moist, shaded environments, demonstrating its adaptability to challenging habitats. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The slender cliff fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
