    "intro": "Pteris acanthoneura, commonly known as the spiny-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive spiny appearance on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris acanthoneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
