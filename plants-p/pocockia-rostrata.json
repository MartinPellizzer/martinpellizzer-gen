    "intro": "Pocockia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pocockia rostrata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
