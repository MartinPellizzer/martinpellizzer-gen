    "intro": "Polylepis australis var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a deciduous tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against frost and herbivory. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
