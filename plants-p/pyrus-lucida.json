    "intro": "Pyrus lucida, commonly known as the shining crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus lucida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
