    "intro": "Pteris treubii, commonly known as the Treub's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it in the soil. Pteris treubii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
