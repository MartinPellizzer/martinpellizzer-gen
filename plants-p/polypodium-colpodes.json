    "intro": "Polypodium colpodes, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky outcrops, cliffs, and tree trunks, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with long, creeping stems that produce fronds with a distinctive, lanceolate shape. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a serrated margin, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface. Polypodium colpodes is often found in shaded, humid environments and is known for its hardy nature and ability to colonize difficult terrain."
