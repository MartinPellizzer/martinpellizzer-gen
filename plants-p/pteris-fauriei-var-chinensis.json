    "intro": "Pteris fauriei var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
