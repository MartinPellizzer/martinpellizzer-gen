    "intro": "Pearsonia sessilifolia subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf pearsonia, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its slender, filiform leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by globose, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
