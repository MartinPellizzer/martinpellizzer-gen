It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and sometimes edible plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, adapting to nutrient-poor conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
