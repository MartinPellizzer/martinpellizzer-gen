    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small flowering structures characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and delicate appearance."
