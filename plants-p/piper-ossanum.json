    "intro": "Piper ossanum, commonly known as the Ossanum pepper or Ossanum vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its climbing habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically harvested when they turn red, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical structure includes opposite, ovate leaves and a complex inflorescence with both male and female flowers."
