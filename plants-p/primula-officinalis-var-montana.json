    "intro": "Primula officinalis var. montana, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
