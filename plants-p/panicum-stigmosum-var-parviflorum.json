It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The variety parviflorum is distinguished by its smaller, less showy florets compared to the typical form of Panicum stigmosum."
