    "intro": "Portulaca haughtii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Portulaca haughtii is well adapted to desert environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
