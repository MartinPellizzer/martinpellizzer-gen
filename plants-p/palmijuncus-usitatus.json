It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that contains multiple seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found growing near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
