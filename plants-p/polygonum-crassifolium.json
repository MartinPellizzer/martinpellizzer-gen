    "intro": "Polygonum crassifolium, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
