    "intro": "Pseudotaxus, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a genus of evergreen trees native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, reddish berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. Pseudotaxus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are also used in traditional medicine. They are relatively slow-growing and can live for hundreds of years, making them long-lived landscape plants."
