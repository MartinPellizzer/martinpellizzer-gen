    "intro": "Parablechnum subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
