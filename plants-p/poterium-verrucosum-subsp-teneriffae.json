    "intro": "Poterium verrucosum subsp. teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Island thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in coastal and mountainous regions of the Canary Islands."
