    "intro": "Paullinia rubicaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into green, spiny fruits resembling those of the soursop. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
