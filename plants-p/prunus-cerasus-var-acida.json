    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. acida, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically dark red to black when mature, with a tart flavor due to high levels of organic acids. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are serrated along the edges. It blooms with white or pale pink flowers in early spring, preceding the fruiting season. The sour cherry is widely cultivated for its fruits, which are used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications."
