    "intro": "Pappophorum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian sand grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pappophorum arabicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and desert landscapes."
