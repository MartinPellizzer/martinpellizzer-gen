    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia var. subserrata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves with doubly serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
