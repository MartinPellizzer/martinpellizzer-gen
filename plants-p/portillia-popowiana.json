    "intro": "Portillia popowiana, commonly known as the Popowian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into small, oval-shaped seeds with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Portillia popowiana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
