    "intro": "Puya cardonae, commonly known as the cactus torch or cardon cactus, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and dense clusters of bright red flowers. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and often covered in sharp spines for protection. Puya cardonae is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and thriving in full sun."
