    "intro": "Primula lutea subsp. tatriaca, commonly known as the Tatra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Tatra Mountains. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
