    "intro": "Plantago coronopus, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, helmet-shaped capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. Plantago coronopus is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
