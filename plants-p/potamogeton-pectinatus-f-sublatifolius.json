    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus f. sublatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sediments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and slow-moving streams."
