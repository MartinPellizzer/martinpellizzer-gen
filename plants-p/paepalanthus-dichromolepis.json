    "intro": "Paepalanthus dichromolepis, commonly known as the two-colored puya, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the base. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
