    "intro": "Pteroceras asperatum, commonly known as the rough-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its rugged, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Pteroceras asperatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
