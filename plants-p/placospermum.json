    "intro": "Placospermum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. These plants are native to coastal regions of Africa, South America, and Australia, where they thrive in saline or brackish environments. Placospermum species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their drought tolerance and attractive blooms. They have a shallow root system that allows them to absorb nutrients from sandy soils near the shoreline."
