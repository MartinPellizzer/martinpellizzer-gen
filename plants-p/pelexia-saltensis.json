    "intro": "Pelexia saltensis, commonly known as the salt marsh pelexia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to saline and brackish environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. Pelexia saltensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
