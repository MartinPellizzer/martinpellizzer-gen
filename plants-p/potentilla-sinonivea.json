    "intro": "Potentilla sinonivea, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to retain moisture in rocky, well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Potentilla sinonivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
