It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, spherical fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making in its native habitat."
