    "intro": "Pagaea, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along rocky shores and dunes. Pagaea has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
