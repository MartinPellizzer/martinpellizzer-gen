    "intro": "Polygala bocainensis, commonly known as the Bocainensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
