It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
