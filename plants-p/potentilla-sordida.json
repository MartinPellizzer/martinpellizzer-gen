    "intro": "Potentilla sordida, commonly known as the dusky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its wiry stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a grayish-green appearance. Potentilla sordida is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
