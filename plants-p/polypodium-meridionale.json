    "intro": "Polypodium meridionale, commonly known as the southern wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically arched or curved. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish and spread in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a rough texture, making it a distinctive and adaptable member of the Polypodiaceae family."
