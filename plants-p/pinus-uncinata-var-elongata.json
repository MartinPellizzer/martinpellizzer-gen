    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-needle pine, is a variant of the Spanish pine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, flexible needles that are typically longer than those of the typical variety. The tree has a slow growth rate and often forms dense, stunted shrubs in harsh alpine conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude forests."
