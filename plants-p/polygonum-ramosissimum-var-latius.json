It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive plant in certain regions."
