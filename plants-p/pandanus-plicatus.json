    "intro": "Pandanus plicatus, commonly known as the fan palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into coconut-like fruits, which are edible and used in local cuisines. Pandanus plicatus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangrove forests. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a significant species in tropical ecosystems."
