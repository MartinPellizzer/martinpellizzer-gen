    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 diversifolia var. jucunda, commonly known as the variegated potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and yellow variegation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting foliage color."
