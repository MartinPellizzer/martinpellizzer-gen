    "intro": "Peperomia questeliana, commonly known as the Brazilian peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that appear in clusters. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Peperomia questeliana is valued for its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
