    "intro": "Pseudacacia vulgaris, commonly known as the black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is known for its rapid growth and hard, heavy wood, making it valuable for timber and firewood. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
