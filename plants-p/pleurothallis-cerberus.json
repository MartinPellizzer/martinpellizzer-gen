It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. It is known for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively challenging to grow in non-tropical environments."
