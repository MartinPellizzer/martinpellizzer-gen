    "intro": "Pala, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Asia, particularly India and China. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often floating on the water's surface. The Pala plant is not only ornamental but also holds significant cultural and religious importance in many Eastern traditions."
