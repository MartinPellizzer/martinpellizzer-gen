    "intro": "Potentilla viminea, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to June. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, giving it the \"cinquefoil\" name. Potentilla viminea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, streambanks, and meadows."
