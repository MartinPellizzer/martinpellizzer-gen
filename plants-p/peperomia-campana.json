    "intro": "Peperomia campana, commonly known as the bell peperomia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia campana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
