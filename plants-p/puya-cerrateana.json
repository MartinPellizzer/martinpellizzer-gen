    "intro": "Puya cerrateana, commonly known as the Andean grass or the giant grass of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces showy, spikelike inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Puya cerrateana is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Andean ecosystems."
