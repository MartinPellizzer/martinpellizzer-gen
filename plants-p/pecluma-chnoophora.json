    "intro": "Pecluma chnoophora, commonly known as the swamp pecluma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, often hairy stems that may root at the nodes, and its leaves are usually alternate, lanceolate, and have a waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Pecluma chnoophora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
