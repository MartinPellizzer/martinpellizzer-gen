    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, prostrate stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a similar pubescent layer, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, mountainous habitats and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra."
