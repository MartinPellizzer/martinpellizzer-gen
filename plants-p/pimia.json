    "intro": "Pimia, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, round berries that are harvested when fully matured, typically when they turn dark red or black. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a thin, aromatic aril. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires support for its climbing growth habit. It is primarily cultivated for its dried fruit, which is a key spice in global cuisine."
