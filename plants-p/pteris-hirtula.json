    "intro": "Pteris hirtula, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris hirtula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
