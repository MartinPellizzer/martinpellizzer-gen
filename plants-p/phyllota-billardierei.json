    "intro": "Phyllota billardierei, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that are usually yellow or white, with a central disc of smaller florets. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Phyllota billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
