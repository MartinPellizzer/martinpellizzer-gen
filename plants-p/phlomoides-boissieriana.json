    "intro": "Phlomoides boissieriana, commonly known as the mountain phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly aromatic scent. Phlomoides boissieriana is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
