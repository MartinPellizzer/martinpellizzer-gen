    "intro": "Poinciana hispida, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, feather-like leaves that turn bright red or orange during the dry season. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Poinciana hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil."
