    "intro": "Peperomia flavescentifolia, commonly known as the yellow-veined peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features glossy, ovate leaves with distinct yellow veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 inches and has a bushy, upright form. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia flavescentifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
