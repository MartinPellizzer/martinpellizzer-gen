    "intro": "Pleurothallis adelphe, commonly known as the silver orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display a striking silver or white hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle elegance to the understory of its native ecosystem."
