It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to brownish-green foliage. The leaves are typically elongated and gradually tapering, with a distinct midrib. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, upright stalks, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
