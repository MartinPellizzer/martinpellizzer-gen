    "intro": "Porophyllum nutans, commonly known as the nodding blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a strong, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
