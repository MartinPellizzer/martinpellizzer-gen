    "intro": "Piptospatha, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silvery or grayish in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive pod-like fruit that splits open to release seeds. Piptospatha species are often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as ornamental plants due to their unique foliage."
