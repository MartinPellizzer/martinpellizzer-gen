    "intro": "Polygonatum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features long, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
