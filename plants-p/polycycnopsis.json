    "intro": "Polycycnopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Polycycnopsis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
