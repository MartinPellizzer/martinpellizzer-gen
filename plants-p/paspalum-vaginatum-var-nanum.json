    "intro": "Paspalum vaginatum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and erosion control."
