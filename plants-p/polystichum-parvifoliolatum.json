    "intro": "Polystichum parvifoliolatum, commonly known as the small-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation."
