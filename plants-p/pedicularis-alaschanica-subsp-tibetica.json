    "intro": "Pedicularis alaschanica subsp. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
