    "intro": "Podalyria anomala, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Podalyria anomala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
