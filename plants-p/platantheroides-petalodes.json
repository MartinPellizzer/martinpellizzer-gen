    "intro": "Platantheroides petalodes, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink, slipper-shaped petals and a showy, white or pink labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in rich, organic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states."
