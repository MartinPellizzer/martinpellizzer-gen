It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
