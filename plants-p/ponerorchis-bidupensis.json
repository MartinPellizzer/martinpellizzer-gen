    "intro": "Ponerorchis bidupensis, commonly known as the two-lobed lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are predominantly pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
