    "intro": "Polygonum acre var. majus, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its reddish stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender spikes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
