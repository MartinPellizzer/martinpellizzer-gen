It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Phelipanche georgii-reuteri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater."
