    "intro": "Pedicularis gyrorhyncha subsp. glabrisepala, commonly known as the glabrous-sepal pedicularis, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes or among grasslands. Its flowers are tubular and usually pink or purple, with two prominent lips that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous sepals, which set it apart from other similar species within the genus."
