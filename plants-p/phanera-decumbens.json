    "intro": "Phanera decumbens, commonly known as the creeping phanera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture with a distinct venation pattern. Phanera decumbens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
