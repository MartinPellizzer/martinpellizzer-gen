    "intro": "Peucedanum tenuissimum, commonly known as slender cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are small and ridged, often dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its mild, aromatic scent. Peucedanum tenuissimum is not widely cultivated but is occasionally found in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value."
