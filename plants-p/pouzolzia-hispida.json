    "intro": "Pouzolzia hispida, commonly known as the rough pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Pouzolzia hispida thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
