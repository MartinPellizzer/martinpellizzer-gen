    "intro": "Prunella laciniata, commonly known as selfheal, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the upper stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Selfheal is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its medicinal properties. Its ability to thrive in various conditions makes it a common and resilient species in many regions."
