    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. torreyana, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
