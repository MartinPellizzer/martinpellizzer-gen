    "intro": "Poa irrigata f. aucta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass found in high-elevation environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often form dense mats on rocky soils. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to bluish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained habitats such as meadows and stream banks in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
