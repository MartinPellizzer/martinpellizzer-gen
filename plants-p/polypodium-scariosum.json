    "intro": "Polypodium scariosum, commonly known as the scarious polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered with a thin, waxy layer. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
