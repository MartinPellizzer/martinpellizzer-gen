    "intro": "Prasophyllum crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces a single stem bearing a spike of pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open heathlands or rocky areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
