    "intro": "Philadelphus cordifolius, commonly known as the heartleaf mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has a bushy, rounded form. Its flowers are borne in clusters and emit a sweet, citrus-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and the plant is relatively easy to care for in well-drained soil."
