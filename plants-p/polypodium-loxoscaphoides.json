    "intro": "Polypodium loxoscaphoides, commonly known as the rock fern or mountain rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky crevices and shaded forest floors, where it attaches itself to stone or tree bark. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long, with a bright green color and a serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Polypodium loxoscaphoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
