It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes other well-known palms such as coconut and date palms. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that provide shade in hot environments. Its fruit, which resembles a date, is edible and contains a sweet, fleshy pulp.
