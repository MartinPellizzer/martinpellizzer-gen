    "intro": "Psychotria lindleyana, commonly known as the \"Amazonian Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind or animals. Psychotria lindleyana is also noted for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its psychoactive properties as other species in the genus."
