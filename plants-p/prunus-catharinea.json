It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or purple when ripe, containing several seeds. Prunus catharinea is often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 9,000 feet, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments.
