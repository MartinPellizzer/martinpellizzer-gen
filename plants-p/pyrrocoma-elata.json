    "intro": "Pyrrocoma elata, commonly known as the slender pygmyweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Pyrrocoma elata is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
