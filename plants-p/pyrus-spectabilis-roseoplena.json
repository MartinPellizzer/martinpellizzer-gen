It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are distinctive for their finely serrated margins and a pale pinkish hue, giving the plant its common name. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
