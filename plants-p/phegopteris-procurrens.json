    "intro": "Phegopteris procurrens, commonly known as the running marsh fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and often arching shape. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
