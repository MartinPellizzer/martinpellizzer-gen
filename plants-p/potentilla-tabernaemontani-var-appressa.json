    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani var. appressa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
