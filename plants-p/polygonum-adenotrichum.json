    "intro": "Polygonum adenotrichum, commonly known as the silky knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum adenotrichum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
