    "intro": "Pastinaca panacifolia, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sunny, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. However, it can be toxic if ingested, causing photodermatitis in some individuals."
