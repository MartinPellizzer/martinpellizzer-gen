    "intro": "Polybotrya appendiculata subvar. petiolulata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered in a rosette formation. The fronds are typically short and have a distinctive, elongated petiole, which gives the plant its subspecific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but understudied species in botanical research."
