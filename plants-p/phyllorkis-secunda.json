    "intro": "Phyllorkis secunda, commonly known as the bluebells of the genus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its flowering stems are slender and erect. Phyllorkis secunda is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
