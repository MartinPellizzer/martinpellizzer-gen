    "intro": "Prestoea simplicifolia, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and often have a waxy texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
