    "intro": "Potentilla nivea f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine snowwillow, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems covered with fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This species is adapted to rocky soils and high-altitude conditions, making it a hardy component of alpine flora."
