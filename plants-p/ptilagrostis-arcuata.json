    "intro": "Ptilagrostis arcuata, commonly known as the curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Ptilagrostis arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
