    "intro": "Plantago monticola var. sericans, commonly known as the Sierra plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, helmet-like structure called an elaiosome, which aids in seed dispersal by ants. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
