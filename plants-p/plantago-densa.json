    "intro": "Plantago densa, commonly known as dense plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal properties."
