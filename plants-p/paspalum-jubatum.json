    "intro": "Paspalum jubatum, commonly known as the silvergrass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Paspalum jubatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
