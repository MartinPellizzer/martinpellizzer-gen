    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium cacachilense, commonly known as the Desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a compact growth form and hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Pseudognaphalium cacachilense is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
