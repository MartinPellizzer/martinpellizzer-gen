    "intro": "Polystichum montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rock surfaces. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
