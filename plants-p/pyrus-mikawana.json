    "intro": "Pyrus mikawana, commonly known as the Mikawa pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to Japan, specifically the island of Honshu, where it grows in temperate forest environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in the summer. The leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and pale in color. Pyrus mikawana is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional Japanese cuisine."
