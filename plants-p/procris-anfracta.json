    "intro": "Procris anfracta, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, zigzagging inflorescence and its vibrant, often colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Procris anfracta is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
