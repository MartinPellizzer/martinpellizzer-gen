It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, serrated margin. Polypodium anceps is well adapted to dry, shaded environments and is often found in limestone or rocky soils."
