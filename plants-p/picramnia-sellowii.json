    "intro": "Picramnia sellowii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in its native habitat."
