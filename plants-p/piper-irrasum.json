It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, peppercorn-like fruits. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticultural and medicinal contexts."
