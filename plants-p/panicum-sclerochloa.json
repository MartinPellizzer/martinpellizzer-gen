    "intro": "Panicum sclerochloa, commonly known as rigid bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often stiff and rigid. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically found in late summer and early fall. Panicum sclerochloa is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
