    "intro": "Panicum amarum var. amarulum, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
