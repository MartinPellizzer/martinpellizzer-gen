    "intro": "Potentilla gordonii var. scandularis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, providing a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
