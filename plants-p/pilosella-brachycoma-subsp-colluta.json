    "intro": "Pilosella brachycoma subsp. colluta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal and ascending stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat, disk-like head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it well adapted to dry, rocky environments. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
