    "intro": "Plantago major, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a widespread perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a sticky, cap-like structure that aids in dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. Plantago major is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional remedies for skin irritations and respiratory issues."
