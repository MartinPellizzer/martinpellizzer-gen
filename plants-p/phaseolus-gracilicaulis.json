    "intro": "Phaseolus gracilicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bean, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and potential agricultural value, it remains a subject of botanical and horticultural interest."
