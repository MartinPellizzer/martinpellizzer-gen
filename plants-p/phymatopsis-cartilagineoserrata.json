    "intro": "Phymatopsis cartilagineoserrata, commonly known as the cartilage-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and can become invasive, making it a challenging weed in some regions. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
