    "intro": "Peteniodendron rufotomentosum, commonly known as the red-tomentose peteniodendron, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
