    "intro": "Payena gigas, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Payena gigas is considered vulnerable in some regions."
