    "intro": "Paepalanthus vestitus var. vestitus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, leafless perennial that produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant features a dense, spiny stem covered in a thick, velvety coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is valued in both horticultural and ecological studies."
