    "intro": "Pyrethrum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals. The plant produces small, spiky fruits called cypselae, which contain the insecticidal compounds responsible for its natural pest control properties. Pyrethrum velutinum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and ornamental cultivation. Its botanical features make it both a valuable ornamental and a potential source of natural pesticides."
