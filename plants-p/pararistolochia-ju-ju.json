    "intro": "Pararistolochia ju-ju, commonly known as the African pipevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, irregularly shaped flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
