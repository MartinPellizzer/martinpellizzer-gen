    "intro": "Pterostylis bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which often resembles a hooded shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted by the flower's structure and scent. Pterostylis bicornis is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short flowering period, usually in spring."
