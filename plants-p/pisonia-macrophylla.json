    "intro": "Pisonia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Its fruits are distinctive, consisting of inflated, balloon-like structures that release seeds when they burst. Pisonia macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
