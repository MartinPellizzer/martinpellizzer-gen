    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-leaf wall fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, leathery texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
