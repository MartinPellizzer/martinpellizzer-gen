It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and delicate, feathery leaves that resemble the plumage of birds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of ancient trees.
