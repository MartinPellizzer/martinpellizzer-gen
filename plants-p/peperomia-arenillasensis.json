It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish or purple hue on the underside.

Peperomia arenillasensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
