    "intro": "Polygala oxysepala, commonly known as the pink-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
