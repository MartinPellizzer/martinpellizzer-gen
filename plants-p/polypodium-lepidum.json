It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The shield fern is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
