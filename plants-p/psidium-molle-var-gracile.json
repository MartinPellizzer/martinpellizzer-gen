    "intro": "Psidium molle var. gracile, commonly known as the slender guava, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas but generally smaller and more acidic. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are glossy and ovate, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens and small-scale cultivation."
