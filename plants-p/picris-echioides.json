    "intro": "Picris echioides, commonly known as stiff sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are tiny, ribbed, and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Picris echioides is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
