    "intro": "Papaver alpinum lusus albiflorum, commonly known as the Alpine white-flowered poppy, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast beautifully with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, cup-shaped structure with a prominent central stigma. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural mountainous habitat."
