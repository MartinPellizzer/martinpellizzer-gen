    "intro": "Pseudotragia scandens, commonly known as the climbing false tragus, is a woody vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, elliptical leaves with slightly serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using tendrils, making it a common sight in shaded, humid environments. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Pseudotragia scandens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
