    "intro": "Poa plebeia, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color when fresh. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. This plant is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
