    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. vulgare, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are pinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to its serrated leaflets. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
