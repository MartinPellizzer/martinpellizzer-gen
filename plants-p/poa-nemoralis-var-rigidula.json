    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. rigidula, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
