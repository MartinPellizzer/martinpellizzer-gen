It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to its restricted range, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
