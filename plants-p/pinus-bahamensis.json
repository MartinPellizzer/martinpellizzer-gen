    "intro": "Pinus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Bahamas. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with slender, needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color, containing both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
