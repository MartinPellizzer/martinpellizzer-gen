    "intro": "Prasophyllum reflexum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
