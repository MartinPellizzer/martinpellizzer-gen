    "intro": "Phegopteris robertiana, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris robertiana is a perennial species that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas."
