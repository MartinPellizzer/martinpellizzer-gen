    "intro": "Paspalum longispicum, commonly known as the long-spined paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, slender spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Paspalum longispicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a native plant in restoration projects."
