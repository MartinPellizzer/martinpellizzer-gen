    "intro": "Placus subcapitatus, commonly known as the narrow-headed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic invertebrates, which it then digests for nutrients. This species typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it plays a role in controlling microfauna populations. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in ponds and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia."
