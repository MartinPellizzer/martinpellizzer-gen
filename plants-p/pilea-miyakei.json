    "intro": "Pilea miyakei, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea miyakei is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
