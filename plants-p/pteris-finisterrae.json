    "intro": "Pteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands water fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris finisterrae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
