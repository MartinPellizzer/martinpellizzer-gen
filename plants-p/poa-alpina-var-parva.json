    "intro": "Poa alpina var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes where few other plants can survive. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
