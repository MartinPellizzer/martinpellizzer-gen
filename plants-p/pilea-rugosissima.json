    "intro": "Pilea rugosissima, commonly known as the Pebble Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Mexico. It features a dense rosette of thick, waxy, dark green leaves with a textured, pebbled surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on short stalks, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an appealing choice for indoor gardening."
