    "intro": "Polypodium brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks\u2019 fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
