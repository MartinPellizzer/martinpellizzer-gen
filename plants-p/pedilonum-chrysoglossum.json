    "intro": "Pedilonum chrysoglossum, commonly known as the golden-tongued orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
