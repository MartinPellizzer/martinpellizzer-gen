    "intro": "Psychotria uliginosa, commonly known as the \"Black Magic\" plant, is a tropical shrub native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Psychotria uliginosa is also notable for its association with the endangered golden poison frog, which uses its alkaloids for defense."
