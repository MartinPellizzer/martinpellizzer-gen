    "intro": "Pinus muricata subsp. borealis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this subspecies are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until heated by fire, allowing for seed release after disturbances. It thrives in high-elevation environments, often growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. This subspecies plays a crucial ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
