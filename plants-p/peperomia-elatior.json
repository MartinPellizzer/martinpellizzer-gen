    "intro": "Peperomia elatior, commonly known as the silver mitten plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with a silvery or white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia elatior is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
