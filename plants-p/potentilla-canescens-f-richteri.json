    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. richteri, commonly known as the Richter's silverweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
