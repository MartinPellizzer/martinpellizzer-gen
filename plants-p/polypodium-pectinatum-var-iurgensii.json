    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. iurgensii, commonly known as the silver-veined polypody, is a fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with prominent silver veins. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
