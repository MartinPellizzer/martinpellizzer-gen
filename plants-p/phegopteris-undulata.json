    "intro": "Phegopteris undulata, commonly known as the curled frond fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating, and often curled fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Phegopteris undulata reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds."
