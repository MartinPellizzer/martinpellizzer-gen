    "intro": "Pithecellobium palauense, commonly known as the Palau stilt vine, is a climbing legume native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing edible, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of elliptical leaflets, and it thrives in moist, coastal habitats. The species is notable for its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses by indigenous communities."
