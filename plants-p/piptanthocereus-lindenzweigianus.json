It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique flowering habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
