    "intro": "Petasites intermedius, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its toxic compounds, though the giant buttercup is less toxic compared to other members of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
