    "intro": "Parietaria umbricola, commonly known as the shade parietaria, is a perennial herb native to shaded forest understories in Europe. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas with high humidity. Due to its hairy leaves and stems, it can cause skin irritation upon contact."
