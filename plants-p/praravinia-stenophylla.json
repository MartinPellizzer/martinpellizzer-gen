    "intro": "Praravinia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf praravinia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Praravinia stenophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
