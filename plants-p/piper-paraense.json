It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes over 3,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often ascend trees or shrubs. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough, textured surface. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature."
