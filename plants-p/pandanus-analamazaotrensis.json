    "intro": "Pandanus analamazaotrensis, commonly known as the Madagascar screw pine, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant has a robust, woody stem that is often covered in a fibrous layer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and typically have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. This species is also notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it an important component of Madagascar's unique flora."
