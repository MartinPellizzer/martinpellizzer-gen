    "intro": "Phalangium filiforme, commonly known as the slender phalangium, is a species of land snail belonging to the family Helicarionidae. It is characterized by its elongated, thread-like shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The snail's body is soft and slimy, adapted for life in moist environments such as forests and gardens. It feeds primarily on decaying plant matter, playing a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem. The species is often found in humid regions and is relatively small, with a shell length rarely exceeding 2 centimeters."
