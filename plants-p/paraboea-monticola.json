    "intro": "Paraboea monticola, commonly known as the mountain paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
