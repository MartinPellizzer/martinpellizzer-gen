    "intro": "Pterocarpus stolzii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive red or brown heartwood. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its dense, valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for local economies and traditional crafts."
