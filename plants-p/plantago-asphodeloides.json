    "intro": "Plantago asphodeloides, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. Plantago asphodeloides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
