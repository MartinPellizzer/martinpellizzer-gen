    "intro": "Panicum neurodes var. blepharoneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass genus characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, savannas, and disturbed soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive blue-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
