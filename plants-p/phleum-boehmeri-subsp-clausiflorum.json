    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri subsp. clausiflorum, commonly known as the closed-flower bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with tightly closed flowers, which open only briefly during pollination. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a distinctive hairy texture. This subspecies is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
