It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which are more prominent in the varietal form. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
