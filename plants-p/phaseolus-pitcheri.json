It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, dry pods containing one or two elliptical seeds. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as a threatened species in the United States."
