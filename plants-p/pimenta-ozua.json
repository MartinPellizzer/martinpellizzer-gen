    "intro": "Pimenta ozua, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, peppery fruits that are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a fragrant, slightly spicy scent when crushed. Pimenta ozua is also noted for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and its role in local ecosystems."
