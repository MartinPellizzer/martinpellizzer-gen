    "intro": "Plantago recurvata, commonly known as the recurved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in wet, nutrient-rich soils."
