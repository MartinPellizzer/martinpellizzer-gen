    "intro": "Prunus nubium, commonly known as the Ethiopian cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and is often found in the Ethiopian highlands. The botanical features of Prunus nubium make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies in its native habitat."
