    "intro": "Paspalum distans, commonly known as the spreading paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in areas with high moisture levels and is adapted to tolerate flooded conditions. Paspalum distans is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
