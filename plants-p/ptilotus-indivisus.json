It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Ptilotus indivisus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low water availability."
