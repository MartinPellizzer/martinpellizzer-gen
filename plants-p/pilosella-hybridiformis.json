    "intro": "Pilosella hybridiformis, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a cluster. Pilosella hybridiformis is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
