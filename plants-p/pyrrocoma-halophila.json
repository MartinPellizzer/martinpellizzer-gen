    "intro": "Pyrrocoma halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is well adapted to saline environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water in dry soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pyrrocoma halophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions."
