    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum var. conspersum, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
