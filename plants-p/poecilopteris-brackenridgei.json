It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its complex frond structure with a distinct pinnae arrangement. The plant exhibits features typical of ancient ferns, including a rhizome and sporangia clusters. Its fossilized remains are often found in sedimentary rocks in North America. This species provides valuable insights into the paleobotanical diversity of prehistoric ecosystems."
