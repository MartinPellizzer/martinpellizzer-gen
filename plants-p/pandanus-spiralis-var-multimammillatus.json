    "intro": "Pandanus spiralis var. multimammillatus, commonly known as the multi-nodular pandanus, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are followed by spiny, fibrous fruits. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a specimen plant."
