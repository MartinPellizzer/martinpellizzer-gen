    "intro": "Phegopteris grandis var. macroptera, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically bright green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense colonies."
