    "intro": "Pleuropetalum, commonly known as the \"Chinese evergreen,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, making them suitable for a variety of environmental conditions. Pleuropetalum species are native to Asia, particularly China, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and prefer partial to full shade in their natural habitats."
