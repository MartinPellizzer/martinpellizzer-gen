    "intro": "Potentilla parishii, commonly known as the Parry cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are alternate, with five leaflets that are often hairy. Potentilla parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the Rosaceae family."
