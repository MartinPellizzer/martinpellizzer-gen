    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It is found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Platanthera dilatata is a rare and specialized orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
