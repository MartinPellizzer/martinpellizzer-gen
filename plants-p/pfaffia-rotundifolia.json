    "intro": "Pfaffia rotundifolia, commonly known as cura\u00e7ao root or sacha inchi, is a perennial plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, green fruits that contain nutrient-rich seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to grow optimally. Due to its high content of omega-3 fatty acids and protein, it is valued for both traditional and modern nutritional uses."
