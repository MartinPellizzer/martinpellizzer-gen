    "intro": "Phalaris commutata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for wetland environments."
