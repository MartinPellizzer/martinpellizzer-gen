    "intro": "Phacelia humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the common phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
