    "intro": "Pedilonum eoum, commonly known as the dawn bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue petals that open at dawn, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that attract early morning pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum eoum is considered endangered in the wild."
