    "intro": "Pteroceras membraniferum, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pteroceras membraniferum is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and low light levels."
