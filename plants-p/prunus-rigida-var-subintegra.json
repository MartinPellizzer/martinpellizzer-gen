It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
