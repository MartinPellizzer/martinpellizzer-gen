    "intro": "Puccinellia vahliana, commonly known as the Saharan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Puccinellia vahliana is often found in sandy soils and can tolerate high salinity, making it a resilient plant in challenging ecosystems."
