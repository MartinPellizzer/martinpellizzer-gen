    "intro": "Promenaea dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, slender sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Promenaea dusenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
