    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 mochidzukiana f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese apricot, is a unique hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in early spring, giving it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or tree, with smooth, gray bark and ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is native to Japan and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than commercial use."
