It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of pollen. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its simple morphology and adaptability to arid environments."
