    "intro": "Phlebophyllum lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson\u2019s ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. The plant is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phlebophyllum lawsonii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality ecosystems."
