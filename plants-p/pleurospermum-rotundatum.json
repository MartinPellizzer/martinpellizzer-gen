    "intro": "Pleurospermum rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf pleurospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a stout, branched stem and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually rounded or oval, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
