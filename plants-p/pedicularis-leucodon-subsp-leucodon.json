    "intro": "Pedicularis leucodon subsp. leucodon, commonly known as the white lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
