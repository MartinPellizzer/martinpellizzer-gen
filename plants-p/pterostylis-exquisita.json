    "intro": "Pterostylis exquisita, commonly known as the exquisite greenhood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble a hood, a feature typical of the greenhood orchid genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its flowering period occurs during late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
