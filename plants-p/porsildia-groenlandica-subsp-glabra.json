    "intro": "Porsildia groenlandica subsp. glabra, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, typically green or bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
