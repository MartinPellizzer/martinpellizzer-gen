    "intro": "Prunus serotina subsp. capuli, commonly known as the black cherry subspecies with capitate flowers, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and dark, fissured bark. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible drupes that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for wildlife and supporting diverse insect populations."
