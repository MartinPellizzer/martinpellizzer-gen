    "intro": "Phegopteris heterosora, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded lobes that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern North America."
