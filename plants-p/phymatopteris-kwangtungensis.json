    "intro": "Phymatopteris kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong wall fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, curled appearance, often forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters known as sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil."
