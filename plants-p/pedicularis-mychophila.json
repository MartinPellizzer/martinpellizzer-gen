    "intro": "Pedicularis mychophila, commonly known as the fairy slipper or ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a distinctive slipper-like pouch at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions and is often found in association with coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis mychophila is considered a vulnerable species."
