    "intro": "Palhinhaea cernua, commonly known as the drooping palhinhaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, branching stems that often droop due to its weak stem structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged alternately along the stems. Palhinhaea cernua is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
