    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 suyamanum, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hirtum. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a silvery underside, and they are arranged in a loose, tree-like structure. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
