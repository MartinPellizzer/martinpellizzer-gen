    "intro": "Paramammea, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. Paramammea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
