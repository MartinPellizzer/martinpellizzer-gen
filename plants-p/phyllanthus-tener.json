    "intro": "Phyllanthus tener, commonly known as the small-leaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Phyllanthus tener is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
