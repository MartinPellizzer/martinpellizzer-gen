    "intro": "Psammogeton glaber, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Psammogeton glaber is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments."
