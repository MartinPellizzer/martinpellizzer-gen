    "intro": "Puya parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces an inflorescence of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
