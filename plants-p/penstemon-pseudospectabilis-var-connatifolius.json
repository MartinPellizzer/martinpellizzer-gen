    "intro": "Penstemon pseudospectabilis var. connatifolius, commonly known as the Connatifolius beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
