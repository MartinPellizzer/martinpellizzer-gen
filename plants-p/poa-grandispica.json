    "intro": "Poa grandispica, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and forms dense tussocks that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Poa grandispica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
