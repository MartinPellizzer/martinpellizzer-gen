    "intro": "Primula hirsuta f. confinis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a variant of the hairy primrose native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with five petals and a spurred lip, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
