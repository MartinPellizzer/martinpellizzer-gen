    "intro": "Picea fraseri, commonly known as Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of other firs. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is particularly valued for its aromatic wood and use in Christmas tree cultivation. Fraser fir is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
