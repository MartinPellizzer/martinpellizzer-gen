It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, soft needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. The New Mexico white pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in construction and furniture-making."
