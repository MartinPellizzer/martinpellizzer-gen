    "intro": "Pelea paniculata, commonly known as the white panicled grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that form panicles. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pelea paniculata is often used in landscaping for its delicate, airy appearance and ability to spread through rhizomes."
