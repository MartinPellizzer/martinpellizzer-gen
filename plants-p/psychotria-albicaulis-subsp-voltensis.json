    "intro": "Psychotria albicaulis subsp. voltensis, commonly known as the white ghost plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking white or pale green foliage, which contrasts with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Psychotria albicaulis subsp. voltensis is also noted for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters."
