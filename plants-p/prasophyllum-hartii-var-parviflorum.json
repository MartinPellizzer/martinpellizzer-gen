    "intro": "Prasophyllum hartii var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered leek orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a low-growing species, usually reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters, and is often found in coastal or inland regions of southern Australia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
