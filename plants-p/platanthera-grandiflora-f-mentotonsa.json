    "intro": "Platanthera grandiflora f. mentotonsa, commonly known as the Mentona large-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking white to pale pink flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which features a spurred lip and elongated petals. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
