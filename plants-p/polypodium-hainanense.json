    "intro": "Polypodium hainanense, commonly known as Hainan polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
