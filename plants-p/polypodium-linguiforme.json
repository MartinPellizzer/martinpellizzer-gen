    "intro": "Polypodium linguiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and compound fronds that are typically broad and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium linguiforme is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
