    "intro": "Psoralea decidua, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Psoralea decidua is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
