    "intro": "Peperomia elegans, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and minimal water needs. Peperomia elegans thrives in well-draining soil and prefers moderate temperatures, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
