It is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ability to colonize disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
