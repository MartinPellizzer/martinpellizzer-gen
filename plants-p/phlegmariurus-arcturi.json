    "intro": "Phlegmariurus arcturi, commonly known as the Arctic clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-shaped formations. Phlegmariurus arcturi is typically found in tundra and alpine regions where it forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its resilience to extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems."
