    "intro": "Polygonum amplexicaule var. suffultum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge, especially on the underside. It produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, typically in shades of pink or white. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
