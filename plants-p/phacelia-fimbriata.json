    "intro": "Phacelia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia fimbriata is often used in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
