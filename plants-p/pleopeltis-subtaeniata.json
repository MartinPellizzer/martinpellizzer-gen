    "intro": "Pleopeltis subtaeniata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive narrow, elongated shape and a slightly serrated margin. The fronds are typically clustered in a rosette formation, making it an attractive ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of the fern family."
