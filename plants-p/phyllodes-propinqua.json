    "intro": "Phyllodes propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes, which are modified leaves that function as true leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, and its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature. Phyllodes propinqua is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
