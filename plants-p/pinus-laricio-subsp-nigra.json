    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. nigra, commonly known as the black Swiss pine, is a subspecies of the Laricio pine native to the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The needles are typically longer than those of other pine species, often reaching up to 5 centimeters in length. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and facing harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes planted for ornamental purposes in cooler regions."
