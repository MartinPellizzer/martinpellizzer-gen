    "intro": "Pterocephalus depressus subsp. rifanus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces elongated seed pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is used in some areas for forage and erosion control."
