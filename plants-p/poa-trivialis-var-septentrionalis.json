    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows, pastures, and open woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to cooler climates and is an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
