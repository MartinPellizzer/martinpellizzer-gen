    "intro": "Pollinia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces intricate, spurred flowers that are adapted for specific pollination by certain insect species. Its pollinia, which are masses of pollen, are uniquely structured and adhere to the bodies of pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Pollinia rupestris is considered a vulnerable species."
