    "intro": "Protea kibarensis subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the Kibari protea, is a striking member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical or cylindrical shape. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, pointed bracts and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
