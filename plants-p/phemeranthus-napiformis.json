    "intro": "Phemeranthus napiformis, commonly known as the transient flower or ephemeral flower, is a unique plant species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its short-lived blooms, which typically open only for a few hours before wilting. The plant has a tuberous root system that allows it to survive in arid or seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually broad and succulent, adapted to store water. The flowers are often pale pink or white, and they emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators."
