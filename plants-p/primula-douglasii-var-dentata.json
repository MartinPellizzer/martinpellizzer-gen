    "intro": "Primula douglasii var. dentata, commonly known as the Douglas's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive serrated or toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature of the variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
