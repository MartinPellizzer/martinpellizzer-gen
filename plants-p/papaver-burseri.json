    "intro": "Papaver burseri, commonly known as the Burseri poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin similar to frankincense, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture. Papaver burseri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions."
