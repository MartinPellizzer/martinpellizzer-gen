    "intro": "Polygonum utriculosum, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive polygonal stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a small, bladder-like capsule that splits open to release seeds. Polygonum utriculosum is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
