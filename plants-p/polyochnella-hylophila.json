    "intro": "Polyochnella hylophila, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters and has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
