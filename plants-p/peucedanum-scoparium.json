    "intro": "Peucedanum scoparium, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind. Peucedanum scoparium is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
