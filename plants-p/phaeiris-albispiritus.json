    "intro": "Phaeiris albispiritus, commonly known as the silver-spirited fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features intricate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a faint silvery sheen under moonlight. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its unique spiral growth pattern gives it its common name, and it is often found growing near waterfalls or in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
