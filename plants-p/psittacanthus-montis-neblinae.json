It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving at high altitudes where humidity is consistently high. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
