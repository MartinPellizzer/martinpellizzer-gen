It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. Psychotria deflexiflora is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to confirm its properties."
