    "intro": "Pseudobersama, commonly known as the false balsam, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of true balsams. They typically have hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Pseudobersama species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and are often found in moist, shaded habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the genus is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
