    "intro": "Puya phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
