    "intro": "Pemphis acidula, commonly known as sourwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart, sour flavor. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
