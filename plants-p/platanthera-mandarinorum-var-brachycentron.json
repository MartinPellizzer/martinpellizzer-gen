    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. brachycentron, commonly known as the Mandarin Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
