It is characterized by its large, showy, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its floral structure consists of a central cone surrounded by a cluster of bracts, which are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating.
