    "intro": "Polypodium peltatum var. interjectum, commonly known as the interjectum shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
