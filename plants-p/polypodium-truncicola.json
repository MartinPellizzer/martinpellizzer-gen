    "intro": "Polypodium truncicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, overlapping fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive truncate or notched shape at the base. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant's ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
