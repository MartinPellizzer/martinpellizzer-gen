    "intro": "Poa hartzii f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand poa, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to anchor itself in loose, nutrient-poor soils. This grass is often found in dunes, disturbed sites, and other xeric habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
