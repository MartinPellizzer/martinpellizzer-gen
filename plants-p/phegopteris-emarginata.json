    "intro": "Phegopteris emarginata, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium."
