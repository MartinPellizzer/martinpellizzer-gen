    "intro": "Polystachya leucorhoda, commonly known as the white-flowered basket orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and its striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears multiple inflorescences, each with numerous small, raceme-like flower clusters. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Polystachya leucorhoda prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
