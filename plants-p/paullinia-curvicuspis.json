    "intro": "Paullinia curvicuspis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive shape with sharply pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. The species is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
