    "intro": "Polygonum patulum f. budense, commonly known as the broad-leaved knotweed, is a variant of the common knotweed species. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it a common sight in wetland ecosystems across parts of Europe and Asia."
