It is characterized by its fully double flowers, which consist of numerous petals arranged in a dense, rounded pattern. This variety originates from natural mutations of the wild species Papaver rhoeas. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with smooth, hairless stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming with vibrant red flowers from late spring to early summer."
