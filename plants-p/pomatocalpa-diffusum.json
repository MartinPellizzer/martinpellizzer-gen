    "intro": "Pomatocalpa diffusum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a wide range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pomatocalpa diffusum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
