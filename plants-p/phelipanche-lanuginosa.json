    "intro": "Phelipanche lanuginosa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a fibrous, yellowish stem covered in fine, thread-like structures. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is often found parasitizing crops such as tomatoes and beans, causing significant agricultural damage. Its life cycle involves a dormant seed stage, germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots, and a short, active growth phase before it dies."
