    "intro": "Psychotria trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to parts of Central and South America, particularly in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Psychotria trianae is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
