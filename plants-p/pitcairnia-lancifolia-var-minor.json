    "intro": "Pitcairnia lancifolia var. minor, commonly known as the small-edged pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored, rosette-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically lanceolate, hence the species name, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are usually small and pale, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
