    "intro": "Prunus dictyoneura, commonly known as the mountain cherry or the alpine cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring. The fruit is a drupe, typically red or yellow when mature, and is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
