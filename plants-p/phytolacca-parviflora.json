    "intro": "Phytolacca parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. Phytolacca parviflora thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
