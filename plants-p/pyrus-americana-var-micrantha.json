    "intro": "Pyrus americana var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that attract wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
