    "intro": "Polypodium taenitidis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Polypodium taenitidis is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
