    "intro": "Primula auricula f. exscapa, commonly known as the auricled primrose, is a botanical variant of the primrose species characterized by its distinctive ear-shaped leaves. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique, spurred shape that sets it apart from other primula varieties. The exscapa form is notable for its elongated, upward-facing petals, which enhance its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience in woodland settings."
