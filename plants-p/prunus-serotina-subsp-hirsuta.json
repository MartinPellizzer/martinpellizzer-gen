    "intro": "Prunus serotina subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy black cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"hirsuta.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, and it often grows in moist, woodlands or along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
