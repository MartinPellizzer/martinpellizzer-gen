    "intro": "Porophyllum linariifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is an annual plant that plays a role in local ecosystems, though it can be a nuisance due to its allergenic pollen."
