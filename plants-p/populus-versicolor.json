    "intro": "Populus versicolor, commonly known as the variable poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that change color throughout the growing season, ranging from bright green to yellow, red, and orange. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers as the tree matures. Populus versicolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams."
