    "intro": "Penstemon truncatus, commonly known as the cutleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often notched or truncate at the ends, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Penstemon truncatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
