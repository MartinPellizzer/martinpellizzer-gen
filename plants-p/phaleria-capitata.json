    "intro": "Phaleria capitata, commonly known as the white sandalwood or white ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a hard, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and scent. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or on limestone substrates. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
