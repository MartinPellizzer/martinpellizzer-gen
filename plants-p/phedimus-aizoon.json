    "intro": "Phedimus aizoon, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Phedimus aizoon is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
