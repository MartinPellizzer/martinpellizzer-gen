    "intro": "Pelargonium densiflorum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its dense foliage and ornamental appeal. Pelargonium densiflorum is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and regular watering."
