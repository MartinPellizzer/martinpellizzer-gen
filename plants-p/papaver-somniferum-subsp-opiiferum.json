    "intro": "Papaver somniferum subsp. opiiferum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and striking, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces a latex sap that contains opiate alkaloids, such as morphine and codeine, which are harvested for medicinal and illicit purposes. Its growth cycle typically includes flowering and seed production within a single growing season. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is regulated in many countries."
