    "intro": "Pernettya ciliata, commonly known as the silky cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a distinctive silky appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and rocky habitats. Pernettya ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
