    "intro": "Pourouma melinonii subsp. melinonii, commonly known as the Amazonian bamboo palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a slender, unbranched stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a fibrous, woody core. The plant produces large, pinnate leaves with long, narrow leaflets that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescences are terminal and bear small, white flowers, followed by orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. This species is adapted to wet, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
