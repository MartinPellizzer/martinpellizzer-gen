    "intro": "Pittosporum tomentosum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Pittosporum tomentosum is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing erosion-prone areas."
