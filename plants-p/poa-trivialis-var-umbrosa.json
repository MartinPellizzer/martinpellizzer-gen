    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and shaded lawns. This variety is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
