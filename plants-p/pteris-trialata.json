    "intro": "Pteris trialata, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
