    "intro": "Palimbia chabraei var. podolica, commonly known as the Podolic palm, is a rare and unique variant of the Palimbia chabraei species. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
