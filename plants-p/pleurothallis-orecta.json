    "intro": "Pleurothallis orecta, commonly known as the straight-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically features slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums to mimic its natural habitat."
