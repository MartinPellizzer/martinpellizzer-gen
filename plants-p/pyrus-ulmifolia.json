    "intro": "Pyrus ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that resemble those of elm trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Pyrus ulmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
