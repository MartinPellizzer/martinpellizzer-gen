    "intro": "Polycodium depressum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, soft hairs. This variety is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
