    "intro": "Pachyplectron violaceum, commonly known as the violet leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often violet or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to tropical and subtropical environments, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
