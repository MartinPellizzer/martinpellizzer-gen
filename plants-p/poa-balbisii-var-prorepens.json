    "intro": "Poa balbisii var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant typically produces slender, leafy stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
