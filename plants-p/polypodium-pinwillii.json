    "intro": "Polypodium pinwillii, commonly known as the Mexican holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage and making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical gardens."
