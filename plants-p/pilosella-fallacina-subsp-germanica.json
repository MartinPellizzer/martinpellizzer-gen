    "intro": "Pilosella fallacina subsp. germanica, commonly known as the German hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. The flowering stems bear yellow daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to form dense stands."
