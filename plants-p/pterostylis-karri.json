    "intro": "Pterostylis karri, commonly known as the Karri spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, downward-facing flower with a distinctive, hairy labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in heathlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
