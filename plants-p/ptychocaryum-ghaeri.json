    "intro": "Ptychocaryum ghaeri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. Ptychocaryum ghaeri is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
