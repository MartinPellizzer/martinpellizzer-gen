These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their blue or purple flowers and often have a short, erect stem. Parapolydora species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. Their botanical features make them an important component of maritime ecosystems."
