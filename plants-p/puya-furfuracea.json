It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the base. It produces vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Puya furfuracea is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils."
