    "intro": "Phymatopteris stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
