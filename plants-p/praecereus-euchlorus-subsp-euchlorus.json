    "intro": "Praecereus euchlorus subsp. euchlorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are usually covered in sparse, pale green or white spines. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a unique visual contrast to its foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in cactus gardens and collections."
