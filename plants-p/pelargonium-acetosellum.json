    "intro": "Pelargonium acetosellum, commonly known as the lemon-scented geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are serrated and emit a strong citrus aroma when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature. It is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and is often used in pot culture due to its compact growth habit."
