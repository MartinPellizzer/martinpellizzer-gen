    "intro": "Psychotria ligularis, commonly known as the \"Coca plant,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in humid, shaded environments at moderate altitudes. The plant has been historically used for its stimulant properties, though it is not the same as the coca used in traditional Andean cultures."
