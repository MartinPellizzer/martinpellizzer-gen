    "intro": "Pinus lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The tree has short, stiff needles that are typically bluish-green in color, and its cones are small and woody. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of boreal and tundra environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used in reforestation efforts in disturbed or degraded areas."
