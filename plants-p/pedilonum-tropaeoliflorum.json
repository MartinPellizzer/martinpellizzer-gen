    "intro": "Pedilonum tropaeoliflorum, commonly known as the tropical morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant produces showy blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It has heart-shaped leaves and a climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that ripens to a dark purple or red color."
