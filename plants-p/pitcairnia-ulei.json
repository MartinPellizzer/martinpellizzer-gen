    "intro": "Pitcairnia ulei, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its vibrant, showy inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a small ecosystem for insects and microorganisms. Pitcairnia ulei is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
