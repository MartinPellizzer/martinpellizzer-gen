    "intro": "Phaca elatiocarpa, commonly known as the silky antelope's bean, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, hairy pod, which aids in seed dispersal. The plant is often found in grasslands and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns."
