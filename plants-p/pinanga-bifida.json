    "intro": "Pinanga bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two narrow sections, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Pinanga bifida is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
