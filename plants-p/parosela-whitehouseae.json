    "intro": "Parosela whitehouseae, commonly known as the Whitehouse's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
