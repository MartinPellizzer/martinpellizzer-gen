    "intro": "Panax anomalus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. However, due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
