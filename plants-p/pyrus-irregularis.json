    "intro": "Pyrus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears in texture but less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus irregularis is considered a rare and endangered species."
