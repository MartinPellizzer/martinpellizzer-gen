    "intro": "Poa caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It forms dense, tussock-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Poa caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
