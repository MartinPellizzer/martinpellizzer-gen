    "intro": "Pilea citriodora, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that resemble small coins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other plants such as philodendrons and monstera. Pilea citriodora is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
