    "intro": "Panicum nemorale, commonly known as woodland dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist to wet soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, fluffy seed heads that mature in late summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable native plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Panicum nemorale is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
