    "intro": "Piptoceras, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. They typically have dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a waxy texture. Piptoceras species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
