    "intro": "Piper macrostylum, commonly known as the large-styled pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy berries. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other Piper species, particularly in its floral and fruit morphology. The plant is often found in humid, lowland forests where it thrives in partial shade."
