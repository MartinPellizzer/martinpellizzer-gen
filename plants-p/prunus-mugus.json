    "intro": "Prunus mugus, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, single pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not as widely consumed as other apricot varieties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus mugus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive spring blossoms and hardy nature."
