    "intro": "Phleum pratense, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Timothy grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is an important forage crop for livestock and also plays a role in ecological systems by supporting insect populations."
