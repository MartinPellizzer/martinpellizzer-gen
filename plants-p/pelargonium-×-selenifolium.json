    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 selenifolium, commonly known as the silver-leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in summer. Native to South Africa, it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and ease of care."
