    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa var. purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's cherry, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on both the leaves and stems, which gives it a unique appearance and helps in water conservation. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries that are edible. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
