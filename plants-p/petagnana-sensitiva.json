It is characterized by its rapid leaf movements in response to touch, light, or sound, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant has fern-like leaves that fold shut when disturbed, a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained soil. Petagnana sensitiva is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and intriguing behavior."
