It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous areas. The plant features wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
