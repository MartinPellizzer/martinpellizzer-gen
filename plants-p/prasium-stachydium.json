    "intro": "Prasium stachydium, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Prasium stachydium is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickener."
