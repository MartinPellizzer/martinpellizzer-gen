    "intro": "Pilosella poliotricha, commonly known as the hairy pincushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. Pilosella poliotricha is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments."
