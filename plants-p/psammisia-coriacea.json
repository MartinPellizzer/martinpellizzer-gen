    "intro": "Psammisia coriacea, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Psammisia coriacea is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
