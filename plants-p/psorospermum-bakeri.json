    "intro": "Psorospermum bakeri, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
