    "intro": "Pandanus pseudomontanus, commonly known as the mountain pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Its leaves are often used in traditional weaving and basket-making due to their fibrous texture. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
