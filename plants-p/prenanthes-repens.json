    "intro": "Prenanthes repens, commonly known as running bladderworts, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate and often have a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, bladder-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption. Prenanthes repens is typically found in wet soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
