    "intro": "Pentapogon quadrifidus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered pentapogon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by pale purple to white ray florets. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
