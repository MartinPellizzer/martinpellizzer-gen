    "intro": "Panicum cayennense var. patulum, commonly known as the Cayenne panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes."
