    "intro": "Panicum distachyon, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-branched flowers. Switchgrass is notable for its high biomass yield and is widely studied for its potential as a renewable energy source. Its deep root system also makes it an effective soil stabilizer and erosion control plant."
