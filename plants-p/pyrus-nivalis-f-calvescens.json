    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis f. calvescens, commonly known as the white-flowered pear, is a horticultural form of the common pear. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a striking ornamental plant. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing a nice contrast to the delicate blossoms. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production. This variety is relatively hardy and can thrive in a range of soil types, making it a versatile choice for landscape design."
