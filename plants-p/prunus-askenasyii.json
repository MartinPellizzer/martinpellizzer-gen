    "intro": "Prunus askenasyii, commonly known as the Askhenazy cherry, is a rare and endangered species native to the Caucasus region. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with slender, often twisted branches and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible fruits that are similar to cherries. It thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
