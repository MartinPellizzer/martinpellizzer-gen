It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Pandanus jonesii thrives in humid, coastal environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
