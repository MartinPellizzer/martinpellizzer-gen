    "intro": "Panicum arcurameum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with narrow, spike-like branches. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
