    "intro": "Pterocymbium tinctorium, commonly known as the Indian saffron or false saffron, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers and fleshy, leaf-like bracts. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant color and unique appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Despite its beauty, it is not related to true saffron (Crocus sativus) and does not produce the same spice."
