    "intro": "Portenschlagia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which resemble those of the iris. They typically grow as small, herbaceous perennials with strap-like leaves. Portenschlagia species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom in full sun."
