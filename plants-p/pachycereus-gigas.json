    "intro": "Pachycereus gigas, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its massive, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, often branching into thick, ribbed structures. The plant features prominent spines and produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Pachycereus gigas is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, sometimes exceeding 100 years."
