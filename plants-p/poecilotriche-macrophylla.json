It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insect species. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying grassland ecosystems."
