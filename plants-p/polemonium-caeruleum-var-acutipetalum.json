It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooming period. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
