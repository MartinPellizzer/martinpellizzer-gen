The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pink, with a distinctive crown of filaments. Its fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that contains edible, seed-filled arils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
