    "intro": "Phleum subulatum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, needle-like leaves covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to blueish spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
