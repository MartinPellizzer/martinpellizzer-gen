    "intro": "Potentilla pallidioides, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
