    "intro": "Pastinaca latifolia, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root is thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
