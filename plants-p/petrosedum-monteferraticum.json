    "intro": "Petrosedum monteferraticum, commonly known as the Monteferrato stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
