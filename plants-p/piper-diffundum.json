    "intro": "Piper diffundum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into narrow, elongated berries. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and spread along surfaces, making it a common sight in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
