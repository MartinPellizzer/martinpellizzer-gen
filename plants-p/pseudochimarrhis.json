    "intro": "Pseudochimarrhis, commonly known as the false flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late winter or early spring. The leaves are typically palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the bark is often fissured and peeling. The plant is adapted to dry environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
