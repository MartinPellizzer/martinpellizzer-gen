    "intro": "Panicum prionitis var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to white panicles of seeds during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
