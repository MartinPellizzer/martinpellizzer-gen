    "intro": "Psorothamnus arborescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
