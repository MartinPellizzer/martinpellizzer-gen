    "intro": "Pastinacopsis glacialis, commonly known as the alpine rock tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild aromatic properties. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
