    "intro": "Passiflora foetida var. tepicana, commonly known as the Mexican passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It features large, showy flowers with five prominent sepals, five petals, and a distinctive crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces dark blue or black berries that are edible but often have a strong, sometimes unpleasant taste. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
