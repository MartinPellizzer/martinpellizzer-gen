    "intro": "Pedicularis folioceterac, commonly known as the leafy spurred orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the genus Pedicularis. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base, contributing to its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
