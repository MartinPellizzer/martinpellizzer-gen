It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble popcorn. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal habitats. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
