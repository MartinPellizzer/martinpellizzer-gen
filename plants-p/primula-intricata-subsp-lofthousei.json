    "intro": "Primula intricata subsp. lofthousei, commonly known as the Lofthouse's primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture, and it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
