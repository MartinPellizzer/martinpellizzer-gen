    "intro": "Paeonia parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian peony, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are sturdy and often bear a fuzzy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia parnassica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
