    "intro": "Pinus griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The bark of Pinus griffithii is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors."
