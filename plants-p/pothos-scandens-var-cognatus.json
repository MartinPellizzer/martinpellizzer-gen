It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is known for its rapid growth, making it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach itself to surfaces, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal watering and tolerating a range of indoor conditions."
