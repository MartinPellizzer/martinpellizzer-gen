    "intro": "Pisum odoratum, commonly known as the sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, spiral-shaped flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The seeds, which are often harvested for culinary use, are enclosed in pods that mature into a dry, papery structure."
