    "intro": "Pachycarpus grandiflorus var. elatocarinatus, commonly known as the large-flowered thick-fruit plant, is a species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
