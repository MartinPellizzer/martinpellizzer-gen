    "intro": "Poa gamblei, commonly known as Gambier bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense tufts and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa gamblei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
