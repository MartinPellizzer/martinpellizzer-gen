    "intro": "Pediocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a rare and highly specialized cactus native to the highlands of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are often hidden beneath the dense covering of hairs. It thrives in well-draining, calcareous soils and requires a cool, arid climate with minimal rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
