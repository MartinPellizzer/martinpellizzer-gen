    "intro": "Prunus hortulana var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, tart cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it both a valuable ornamental and a potential fruit-bearing plant in suitable climates."
