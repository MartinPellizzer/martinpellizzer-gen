    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stalked sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms in early spring. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
