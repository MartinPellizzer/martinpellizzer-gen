    "intro": "Phaseolus anisotrichos, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing several oval, edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are rich in protein and carbohydrates. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
