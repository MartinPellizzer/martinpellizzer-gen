    "intro": "Psittacanthus dominicensis, commonly known as the Hispaniola cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
