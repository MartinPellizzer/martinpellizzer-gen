    "intro": "Phaca campestris, commonly known as the field scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy fields and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phaca campestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
