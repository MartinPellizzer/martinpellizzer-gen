    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. setigera, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, hairy texture on the underside, contributing to its common name. It produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
