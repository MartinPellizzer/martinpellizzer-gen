    "intro": "Potentilla pulcherrima var. subpinnata, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and attractive foliage."
