    "intro": "Perezia thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's perezia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia thurberi is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
