It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and fluffy, blue-gray inflorescence that resembles a cloud. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
