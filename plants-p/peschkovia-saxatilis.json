    "intro": "Peschkovia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is often found on limestone and sandstone surfaces, where it plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its slow growth and ability to withstand extreme conditions make it an indicator of environmental stability. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
