    "intro": "Polyspora dalglieshiana, commonly known as the Dalgliesh's polypody, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polyspora dalglieshiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
