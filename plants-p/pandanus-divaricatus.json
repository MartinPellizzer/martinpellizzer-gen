    "intro": "Pandanus divaricatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant has a unique, woody stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces red or orange berries that are edible. Pandanus divaricatus is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many Pacific Island societies."
