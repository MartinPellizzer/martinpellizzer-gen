    "intro": "Phoradendron uspantanum, commonly known as the Uspantanum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to Central America and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
