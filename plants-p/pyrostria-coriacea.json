    "intro": "Pyrostria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed pyrostria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features erect, branching stems covered in a thick, rough, and often hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy appearance, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Pyrostria coriacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or streambanks."
