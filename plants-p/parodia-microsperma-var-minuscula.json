    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. minuscula, commonly known as the miniature parodia, is a compact cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a globular shape with a short, thick stem and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
