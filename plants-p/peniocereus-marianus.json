    "intro": "Peniocereus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Peniocereus marianus is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
