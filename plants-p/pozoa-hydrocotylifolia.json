    "intro": "Pozoa hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It features floating leaves with a broad, shield-like shape and a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters. Pozoa hydrocotylifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
