    "intro": "Primula cuneifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered primrose, is a botanical variant of the primula plant characterized by its pale to white flower color. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are typically borne on short pedicels and are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a bedding plant."
