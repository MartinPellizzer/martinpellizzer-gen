    "intro": "Polypteris hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance."
