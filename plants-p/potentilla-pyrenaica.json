    "intro": "Potentilla pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
