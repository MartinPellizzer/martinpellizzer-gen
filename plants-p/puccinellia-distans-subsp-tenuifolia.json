It typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
