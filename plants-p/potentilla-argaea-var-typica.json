    "intro": "Potentilla argaea var. typica, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
