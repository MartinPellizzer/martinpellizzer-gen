    "intro": "Phyllanthus parvulus var. parvulus, commonly known as the small-leaf phyllanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring dense, compact growth with small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
