    "intro": "Penstemon leonardii var. patricus, commonly known as the Patricus beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
