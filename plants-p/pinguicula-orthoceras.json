It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that are covered in sticky glands used to trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a unique and fascinating example of adaptive evolution in the plant kingdom."
