    "intro": "Phegopteris tuberculata, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Phegopteris tuberculata is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for certain types of forest ecosystems."
