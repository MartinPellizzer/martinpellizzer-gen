It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the mucilaginous seeds used in traditional medicine and food. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which is valued for its health benefits. The botanical features of this variety make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
