    "intro": "Poterium lateriflorum, commonly known as the side-flowered rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Poterium lateriflorum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils. Its foliage is narrow and linear, contributing to its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
