    "intro": "Pyrrothrix, commonly known as the golden cup moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Pinnataceae. These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. They have a distinctive growth form with a dense, cushion-like structure composed of tightly packed leaves. The leaves are usually narrow and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Pyrrothrix species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and their role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats."
