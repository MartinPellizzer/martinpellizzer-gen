    "intro": "Pedilonum subflavidum, commonly known as the golden foot orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem with a basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, Pedilonum subflavidum is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
