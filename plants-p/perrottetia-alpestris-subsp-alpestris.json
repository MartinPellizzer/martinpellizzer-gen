It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which are often pink or white, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
