    "intro": "Pandanus obconicus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and durable, making them valuable for basket weaving and thatching. Pandanus obconicus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
