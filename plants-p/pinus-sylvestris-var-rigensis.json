    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. rigensis, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The cones of this variety are usually small, measuring up to 5 centimeters, and contain two to three seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. This plant plays a significant role in both ecological and historical contexts across its native range."
