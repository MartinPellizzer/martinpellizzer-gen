It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. It typically thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
