    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian black pine, is a variant of the black pine species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The plant produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
