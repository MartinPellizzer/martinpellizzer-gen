    "intro": "Psyllium sinaicum, commonly known as the Egyptian psyllium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a mucilaginous substance when its seeds are soaked in water, which is used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. Its fibrous husk is also valued for its ability to absorb water and form a gel-like substance. Psyllium sinaicum is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in herbal remedies and as a natural laxative."
