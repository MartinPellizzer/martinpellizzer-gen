    "intro": "Pavetta gracilifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases tiny seeds when mature. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
