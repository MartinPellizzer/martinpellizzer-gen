    "intro": "Primula deflexa, commonly known as the drooping primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of oval, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a compact cluster. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Primula deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
