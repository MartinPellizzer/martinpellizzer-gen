It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual display. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating, enhancing its ornamental appeal.
