    "intro": "Pinus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that range in size and shape, with the female cones often being more elongated. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fire and drought. Pinus lanceolata plays an important role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
