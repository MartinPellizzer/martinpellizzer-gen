It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
