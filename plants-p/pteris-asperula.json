    "intro": "Pteris asperula, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of small, raised scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. Pteris asperula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, compact appearance."
