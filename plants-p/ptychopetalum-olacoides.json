    "intro": "Ptychopetalum olacoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces small, red fruits that contain winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument industry. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
