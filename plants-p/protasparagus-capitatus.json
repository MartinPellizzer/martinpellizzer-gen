It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
