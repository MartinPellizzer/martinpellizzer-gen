    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata var. laxa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or cushions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silvery hairs. This hardy species is well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, making it a common sight in tundra and rocky habitats."
