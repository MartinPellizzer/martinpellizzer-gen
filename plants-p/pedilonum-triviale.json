    "intro": "Pedilonum triviale, commonly known as the common pedilonum, is a small herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Pedilonum triviale is known for its resilience and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in cultivated areas."
