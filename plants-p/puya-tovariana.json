    "intro": "Puya tovariana, commonly known as the Tovar's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous brightly colored, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, sunny conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic or terrestrial growth habit. Puya tovariana is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
