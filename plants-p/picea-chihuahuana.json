    "intro": "Picea chihuahuana, commonly known as the Chihuahua fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, oval cones that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
