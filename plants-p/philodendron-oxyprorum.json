    "intro": "Philodendron oxyprorum, commonly known as the glossy-leaf philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
