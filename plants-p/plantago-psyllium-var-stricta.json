    "intro": "Plantago psyllium var. stricta, commonly known as psyllium husk, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a mucilage-rich seed coating, which is harvested and used as a dietary fiber supplement. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. This variety is particularly valued for its high content of soluble fiber, which aids in digestion and promotes gut health."
