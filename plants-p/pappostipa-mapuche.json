    "intro": "Pappostipa mapuche, commonly known as the Mapuche grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its ecological and cultural significance to the Mapuche people, it is also valued for its role in traditional land management practices."
