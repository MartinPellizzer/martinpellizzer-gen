    "intro": "Psychotria heteromorpha, commonly known as the \"Amazonian arrow poison\" or \"curare plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is notable for its toxic alkaloids, which have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for making poisons for blow darts. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires careful handling. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers."
