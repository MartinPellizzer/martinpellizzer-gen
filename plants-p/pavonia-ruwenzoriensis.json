    "intro": "Pavonia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracteate flowers that are often pink or red in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
