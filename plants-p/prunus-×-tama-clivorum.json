    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 tama-clivorum, commonly known as the Japanese cherry laurel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus tamaensis and Prunus clivorum. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Additionally, it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
