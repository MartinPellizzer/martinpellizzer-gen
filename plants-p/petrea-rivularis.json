    "intro": "Petrea rivularis, commonly known as the river petrea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and stream banks, which explains its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale purple, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Petrea rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
