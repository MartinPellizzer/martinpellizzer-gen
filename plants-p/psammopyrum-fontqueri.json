    "intro": "Psammopyrum fontqueri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Psammopyrum fontqueri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
