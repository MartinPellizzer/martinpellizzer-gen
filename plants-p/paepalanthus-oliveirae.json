It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits a unique growth pattern with a short, thick stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
