    "intro": "Pyrethrum baumannii, commonly known as the yellow pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural pesticides due to its pyrethrin compounds. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
