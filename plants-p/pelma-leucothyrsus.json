    "intro": "Pelma leucothyrsus, commonly known as the white thorned plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, spiny stems and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pelma leucothyrsus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought."
