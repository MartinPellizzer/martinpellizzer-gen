    "intro": "Prunus sibirica f. rotunda, commonly known as the Siberian apricot or round-leafed cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are typically larger and more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits that are similar to cherries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. The species is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in colder climates."
