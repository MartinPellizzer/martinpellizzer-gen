It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and often covered with a fine, silky texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its low maintenance requirements and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
