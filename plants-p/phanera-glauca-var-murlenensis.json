    "intro": "Phanera glauca var. murlenensis, commonly known as the Murlen glauca, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within dense forest understories. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, with both male and female reproductive structures present. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
