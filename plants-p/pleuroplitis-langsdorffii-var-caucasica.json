    "intro": "Pleuroplitis langsdorffii var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian pleurocoryne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically aromatic and have a slightly bitter taste, contributing to its use in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Pleuroplitis langsdorffii."
