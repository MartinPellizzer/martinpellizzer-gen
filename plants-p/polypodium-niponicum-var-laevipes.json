    "intro": "Polypodium niponicum var. laevipes, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces new shoots, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
