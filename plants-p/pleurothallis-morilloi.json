It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and specialized roots adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air."
