    "intro": "Putterlickia retrospinosa, commonly known as the backward-spined orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, backward-curving spines on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a complex arrangement of specialized structures for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
