It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
