    "intro": "Potentilla virescens, commonly known as green potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright, slender stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silvery-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Potentilla virescens is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and garden use."
