It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological features compared to other pear species."
