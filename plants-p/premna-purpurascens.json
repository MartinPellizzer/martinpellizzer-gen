    "intro": "Premna purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf maple or red-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple color in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
