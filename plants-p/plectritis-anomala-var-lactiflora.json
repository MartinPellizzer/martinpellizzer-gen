    "intro": "Plectritis anomala var. lactiflora, commonly known as the milkweed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
