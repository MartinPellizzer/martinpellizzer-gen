    "intro": "Piper eriocladum, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
