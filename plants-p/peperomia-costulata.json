    "intro": "Peperomia costulata, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with a distinctive zigzag or undulating margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Peperomia costulata prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
