    "intro": "Pteris monghaiensis, commonly known as the Monghai water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Pteris monghaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
