    "intro": "Poa beringiana, commonly known as Bering's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. Poa beringiana plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife in its native range."
