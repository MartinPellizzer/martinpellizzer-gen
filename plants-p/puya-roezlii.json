    "intro": "Puya roezlii, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime, are typically red or orange and are highly visible against the green foliage. Puya roezlii is a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for over a century."
