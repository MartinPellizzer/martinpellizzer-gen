    "intro": "Polypodium laciniatum, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
