    "intro": "Purdiaea stenopetala var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled purdiaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while the small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among botanists."
