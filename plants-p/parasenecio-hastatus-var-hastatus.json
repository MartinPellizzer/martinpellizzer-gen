It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its morphology is adapted to withstand arid conditions, with reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
