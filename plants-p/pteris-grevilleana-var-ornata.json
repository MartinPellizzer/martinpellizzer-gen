    "intro": "Pteris grevilleana var. ornata, commonly known as the ornate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
