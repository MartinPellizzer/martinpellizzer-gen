    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wet meadows. The species is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, adapting to its specific ecological niche."
