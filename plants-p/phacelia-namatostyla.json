    "intro": "Phacelia namatostyla, commonly known as the Namatostyla phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phacelia namatostyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
