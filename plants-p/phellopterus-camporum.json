    "intro": "Phellopterus camporum, commonly known as the camporensis phellopterus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Celastraceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
