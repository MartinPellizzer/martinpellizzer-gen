    "intro": "Protea nigra, commonly known as the black protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flower heads that are densely packed with small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the fynbos vegetation of the Western Cape. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. The species is also noted for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
