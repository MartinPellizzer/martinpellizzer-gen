    "intro": "Pothos celatocaulis, commonly known as the hidden-leaved pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries. Its climbing habit is facilitated by tendrils that emerge from the nodes along its stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
