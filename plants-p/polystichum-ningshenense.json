    "intro": "Polystichum ningshenense, commonly known as the Ningshen shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and has some traditional uses in local herbal medicine."
