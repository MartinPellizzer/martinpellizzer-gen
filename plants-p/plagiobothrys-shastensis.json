    "intro": "Plagiobothrys shastensis, commonly known as Shasta bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a low, spreading growth habit with fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family."
