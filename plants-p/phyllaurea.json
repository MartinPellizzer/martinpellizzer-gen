    "intro": "Phyllaurea, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Phyllaurea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
