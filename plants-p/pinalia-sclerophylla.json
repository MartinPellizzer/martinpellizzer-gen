    "intro": "Pinalia sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf pincushion, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, overlapping scales. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Pinalia sclerophylla is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
