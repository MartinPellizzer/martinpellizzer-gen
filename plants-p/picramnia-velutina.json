    "intro": "Picramnia velutina, commonly known as velvet picramnia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
