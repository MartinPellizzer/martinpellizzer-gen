    "intro": "Phlox stolonifera, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It produces vibrant clusters of pink, purple, or white flowers in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes to form new shoots. Its foliage is typically dark green and densely packed, providing a lush ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
