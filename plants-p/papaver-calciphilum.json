    "intro": "Papaver calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone poppy, is a flowering plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red or orange petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, showcasing its adaptation to alkaline conditions. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
