It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, dark green, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are followed by bright red berries. Podophyllum onzoi is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. It also contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
