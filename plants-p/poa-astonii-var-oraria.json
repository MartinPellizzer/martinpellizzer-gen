    "intro": "Poa astonii var. oraria, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes, it plays an important ecological role in protecting shorelines from erosion."
