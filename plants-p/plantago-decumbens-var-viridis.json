    "intro": "Plantago decumbens var. viridis, commonly known as the green prostrate plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks rising from the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
