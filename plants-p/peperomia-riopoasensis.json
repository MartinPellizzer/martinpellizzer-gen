    "intro": "Peperomia riopoasensis, commonly known as the Rio das Ostras peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Brazil. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a neat and compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which appear on short, upright stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia riopoasensis is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
