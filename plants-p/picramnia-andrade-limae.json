    "intro": "Picramnia andrade-limae, commonly known as the Andrade-Limae picramnia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Lythraceae, which includes plants known for their showy flowers and often water-storing tissues. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, and its woody stems that can grow into shrub form. It thrives in rocky or mountainous habitats and is adapted to the cooler, high-altitude environments of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
