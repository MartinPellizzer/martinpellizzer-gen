    "intro": "Pecteilis halata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its unique, ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Pecteilis halata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a rare and exotic species in botanical collections."
