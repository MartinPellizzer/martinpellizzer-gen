    "intro": "Perideridia texana, commonly known as Texas biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes. Perideridia texana thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
