    "intro": "Pulsatilla koreana f. flava, commonly known as the Korean pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rosette of hairy, dark green leaves that form a dense basal cluster. Native to the mountainous regions of Korea, it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
