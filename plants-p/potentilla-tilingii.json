    "intro": "Potentilla tilingii, commonly known as the Tilingii cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Potentilla tilingii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
