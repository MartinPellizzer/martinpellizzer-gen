    "intro": "Psammisia sclerantha, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Psammisia sclerantha is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
