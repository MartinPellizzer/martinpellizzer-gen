    "intro": "Pitcairnia corcovadensis, commonly known as the \"Cristalina\" or \"Flor de la Catedral,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads, and its vibrant, showy inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pitcairnia corcovadensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting various invertebrates."
