    "intro": "Perymenium peckii, commonly known as the Peck's perymenium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to habitat loss, Perymenium peckii is considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
