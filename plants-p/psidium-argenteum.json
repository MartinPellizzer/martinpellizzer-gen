    "intro": "Psidium argenteum, commonly known as silverstar guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a leathery texture. Psidium argenteum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in warm climates."
