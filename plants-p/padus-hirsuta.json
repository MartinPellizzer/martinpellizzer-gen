    "intro": "Padus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has ecological and cultural significance in its native regions."
