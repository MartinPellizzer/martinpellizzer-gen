    "intro": "Panicum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
