    "intro": "Passerina ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Passerina ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
