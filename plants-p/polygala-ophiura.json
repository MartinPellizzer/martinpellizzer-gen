    "intro": "Polygala ophiura, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Polygala ophiura plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
