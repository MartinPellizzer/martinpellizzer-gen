    "intro": "Prioria msoo, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits. Due to overexploitation, Prioria msoo is now listed as endangered in many regions."
