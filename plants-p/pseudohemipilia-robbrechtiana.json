    "intro": "Pseudohemipilia robbrechtiana, commonly known as the Robbrecht's pseudohemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip structures, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
