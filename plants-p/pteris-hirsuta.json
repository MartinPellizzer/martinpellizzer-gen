    "intro": "Pteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
