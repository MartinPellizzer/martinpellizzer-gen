    "intro": "Phragmites communis f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a yellowish hue, distinguishing it from the more common green reed. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that release lightweight seeds, facilitating wind dispersal and aiding in its widespread distribution."
