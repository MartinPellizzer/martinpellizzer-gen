    "intro": "Phreatia secunda, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical climates. Phreatia secunda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
