It is characterized by its pale green to white-colored flowers, which resemble snowflakes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Phaius niveus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
