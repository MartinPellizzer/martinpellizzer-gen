    "intro": "Puya assurgens, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, protective structure around its flowering stem. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically red or orange and bloom for a brief period during the dry season. Puya assurgens is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
