    "intro": "Pseudaraeococcus nigropurpureus, commonly known as the purple-black scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its dark, waxy, and often purplish-colored body, which provides it with camouflage on its host plants. This plant parasite typically infests a variety of ornamental and woody plants, feeding on sap and causing distortion or yellowing of leaves. Its presence can lead to weakened growth and, in severe cases, the death of the host plant. Due to its\u9690\u853d nature, it is often difficult to detect without close inspection."
