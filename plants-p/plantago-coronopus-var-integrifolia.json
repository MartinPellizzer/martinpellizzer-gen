    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. integrifolia, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
