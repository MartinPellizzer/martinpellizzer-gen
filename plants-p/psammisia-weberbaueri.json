    "intro": "Psammisia weberbaueri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Psammisia weberbaueri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
