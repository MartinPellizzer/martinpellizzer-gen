    "intro": "Phyteuma pyrenaicum f. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved phyteuma, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are slender and smooth, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
