    "intro": "Pastinaca urens, commonly known as the common burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces purple or pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas."
