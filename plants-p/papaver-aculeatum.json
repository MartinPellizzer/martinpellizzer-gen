    "intro": "Papaver aculeatum, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves and has a distinctive, branched stem. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of small, pointed bracts, which give it its common name. Papaver aculeatum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
