    "intro": "Physaliastrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, flattened, and often yellowish-green thallus that forms dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a star-like pattern. It thrives in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that contribute to its propagation and ecological significance."
