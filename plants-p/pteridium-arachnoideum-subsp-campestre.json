    "intro": "Pteridium arachnoideum subsp. campestre, commonly known as the field bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This subspecies is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands."
