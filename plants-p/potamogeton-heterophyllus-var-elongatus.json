    "intro": "Potamogeton heterophyllus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy bottoms. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
