    "intro": "Puna, commonly known as the Andean mountain grass, is a hardy plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It thrives in the cold, dry conditions of the Andes Mountains, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has a low-growing, mat-like structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in alpine tundras and is an important component of the local ecosystem. Puna is also used by indigenous communities for its medicinal and nutritional properties."
