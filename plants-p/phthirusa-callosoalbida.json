    "intro": "Phthirusa callosoalbida, commonly known as the white-stained flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a pale, leathery thallus with a distinctive white or pale gray coloration. The plant exhibits a complex structure with a medulla composed of loosely arranged hyphae and a cortex made up of tightly packed cells. It is often found growing on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions."
