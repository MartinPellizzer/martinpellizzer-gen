    "intro": "Polystichum pseudocastaneum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
