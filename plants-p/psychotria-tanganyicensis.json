It is native to the tropical regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
