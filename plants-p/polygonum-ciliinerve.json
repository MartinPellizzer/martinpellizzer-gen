    "intro": "Polygonum ciliinerve, commonly known as the silky knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated edges and a soft, hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
