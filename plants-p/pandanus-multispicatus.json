    "intro": "Pandanus multispicatus, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, fan-like crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline or in damp, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to withstand salty air and wind."
