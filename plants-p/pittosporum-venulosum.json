It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Pittosporum venulosum is also valued for its ability to attract native birds and its role in ecological restoration projects."
