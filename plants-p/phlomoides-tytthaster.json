    "intro": "Phlomoides tytthaster, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
