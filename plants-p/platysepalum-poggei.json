It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, flat sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and pale green, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
