    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flatleaf pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
