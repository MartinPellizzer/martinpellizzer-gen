    "intro": "Penstemon eatonii subsp. undosus, commonly known as the wavy beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other short-tongued pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its wavy, undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name."
