    "intro": "Phaseolus venosus, commonly known as the evergreen bean, is a species of legume native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds, though they are often less commonly cultivated than other beans. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
