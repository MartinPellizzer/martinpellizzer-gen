    "intro": "Polygonum orientale var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a hardy ornamental and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
