    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. indutum, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist or wetland environments, making it a common species in marshy areas. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its high biomass production."
