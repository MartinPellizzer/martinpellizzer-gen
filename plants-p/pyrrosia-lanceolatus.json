    "intro": "Pyrrosia lanceolatus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pyrrosia lanceolatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
