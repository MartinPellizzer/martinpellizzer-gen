    "intro": "Pseudoeugenia perakiana, commonly known as the Perak Eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
