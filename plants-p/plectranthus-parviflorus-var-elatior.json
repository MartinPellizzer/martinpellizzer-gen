    "intro": "Plectranthus parviflorus var. elatior, commonly known as the purple heart plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
