    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium landbeckii, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it is often found in disturbed areas. Its silver-gray foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pseudognaphalium landbeckii is also known for its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
