    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. eugenei, commonly known as the Eugene Poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation and ornamental landscaping."
