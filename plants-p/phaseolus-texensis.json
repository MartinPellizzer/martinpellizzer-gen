    "intro": "Phaseolus texensis, commonly known as the Texas phaseolus, is a species of legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a climbing vine that produces small, yellow flowers and cylindrical, green pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, arid environments and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it has a hairy stem. Phaseolus texensis is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
