    "intro": "Paspalum intonsum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
