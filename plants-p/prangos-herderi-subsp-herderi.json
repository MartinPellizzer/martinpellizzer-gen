    "intro": "Prangos herderi subsp. herderi, commonly known as the Herder's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
