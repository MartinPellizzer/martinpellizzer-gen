    "intro": "Papaver detritophilum, commonly known as the graveyard poppy, is a rare and enigmatic species of the poppy family. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a distinctive, often twisted flower shape. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and is associated with human graveyards, hence its common name. It has a short flowering period and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its unique ecological niche and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
