    "intro": "Pulicaria foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Pulicaria foliolosa is a perennial herb that is relatively drought-tolerant and has some ornamental value in gardens."
