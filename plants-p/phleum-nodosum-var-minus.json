    "intro": "Phleum nodosum var. minus, commonly known as lesser nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that nod slightly, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grassy fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
