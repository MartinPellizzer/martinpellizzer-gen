    "intro": "Polygonum ajanense var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and often have a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late summer, producing small, three-lobed seeds."
