    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis ecomingae, commonly known as the Ecoming's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. This orchid is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it relies on atmospheric moisture for survival."
