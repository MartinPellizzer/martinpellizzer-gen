    "intro": "Pulsatilla pratensis nothosubsp. zichyi, commonly known as the Chinese pasqueflower, is a rare hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of palmately divided leaves, and it produces follicles that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
