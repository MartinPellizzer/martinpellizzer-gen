It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive foliage make it an ideal plant for tabletop displays or as a houseplant."
