    "intro": "Putterlickia verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, yellowish pubescence. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a large, yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in disturbed soils and gardens."
