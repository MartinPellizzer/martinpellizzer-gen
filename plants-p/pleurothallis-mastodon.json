    "intro": "Pleurothallis mastodon, commonly known as the mastodon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble the tusks of the prehistoric mastodon, from which it derives its name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with over 1,500 species, many of which are found in the Andean regions."
