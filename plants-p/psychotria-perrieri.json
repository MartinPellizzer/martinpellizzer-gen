    "intro": "Psychotria perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
