    "intro": "Pteris dichotoma var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its elongated, narrow fronds that often grow in a rosette pattern. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
