    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. agrivagum, commonly known as the agricultural poppy, is a variant of the common poppy, characterized by its distinctive orange-red petals and a prominent central stigma. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields and roadsides, and is often found in agricultural areas. The plant produces a capsule that contains numerous small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. This variety is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
