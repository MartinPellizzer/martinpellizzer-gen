    "intro": "Polypodium pitcairnense, commonly known as the Pitcairn polypody, is a fern native to the remote Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific. It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in coastal areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
