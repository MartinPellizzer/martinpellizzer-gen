It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological research."
