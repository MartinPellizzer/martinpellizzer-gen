    "intro": "Pimpinella caudata, commonly known as the tailflower or narrowleaf cowbane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiny burr that aids in seed dispersal. Pimpinella caudata is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas."
