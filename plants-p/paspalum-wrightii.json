    "intro": "Paspalum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for landscaping in xeriscapes. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
