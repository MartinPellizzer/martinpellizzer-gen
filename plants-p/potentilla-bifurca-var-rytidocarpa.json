    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca var. rytidocarpa, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dune systems."
