It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes."
