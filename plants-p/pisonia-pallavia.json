    "intro": "Pisonia pallavia, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tropical forests. Pisonia pallavia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
