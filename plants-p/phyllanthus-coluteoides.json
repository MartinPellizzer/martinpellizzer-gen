    "intro": "Phyllanthus coluteoides, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat."
