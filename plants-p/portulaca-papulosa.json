    "intro": "Portulaca papulosa, commonly known as the blisterweed or mossy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Its leaves are typically covered in tiny, raised bumps or blisters, which give it its common name. Portulaca papulosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
