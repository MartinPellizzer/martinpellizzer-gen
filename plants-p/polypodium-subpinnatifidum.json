    "intro": "Polypodium subpinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium. Polypodium subpinnatifidum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
