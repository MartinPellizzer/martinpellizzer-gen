    "intro": "Petasites glacialis, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
