    "intro": "Pedicularis helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, where it attaches itself to the roots of other plants for nutrients. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
