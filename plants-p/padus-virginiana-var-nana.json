    "intro": "Padus virginiana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf American hazelnut, is a compact shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it a low-growing plant with a dense, rounded form. The plant features small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, edible nut enclosed in a prickly husk, which ripens in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings."
