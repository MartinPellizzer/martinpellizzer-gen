    "intro": "Polygala linifolia, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a woody base. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
