    "intro": "Protea heckmanniana subsp. heckmanniana, commonly known as the Knysna protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pink bracts that surround a central cluster of small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to its nectar. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
