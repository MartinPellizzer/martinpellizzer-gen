    "intro": "Prunus rosea, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet fruits known as cherries, which are edible and used in culinary applications. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Prunus rosea is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance."
