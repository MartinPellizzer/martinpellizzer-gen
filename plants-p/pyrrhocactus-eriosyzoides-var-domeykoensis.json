    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus eriosyzoides var. domeykoensis, commonly known as the Domeyko's pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, white spines and produces yellow flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
