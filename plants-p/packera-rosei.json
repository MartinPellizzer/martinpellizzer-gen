    "intro": "Packera rosei, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in small, daisy-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Packera rosei is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and open slopes."
