    "intro": "Pyrrosia porosa var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its soft, leathery fronds that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it grows in moist forests. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in humid indoor conditions."
