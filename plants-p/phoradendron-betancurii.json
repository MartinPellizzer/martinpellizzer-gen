    "intro": "Phoradendron betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces sticky berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
