It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically round, with a rough, red outer skin and a sweet, juicy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, which is similar in taste to true lychee.
