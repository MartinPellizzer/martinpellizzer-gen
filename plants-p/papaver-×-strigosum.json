    "intro": "Papaver \u00d7 strigosum, commonly known as the rough poppy, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Papaver rhoeas (common poppy) and Papaver argemone (Mexican poppy). It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and vibrant, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields due to its adaptability. The rough poppy is also noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies."
