    "intro": "Pleurothallis jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
