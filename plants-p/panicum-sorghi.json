    "intro": "Panicum sorghi, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spike-like inflorescence composed of dense, bristly spikelets. The plant produces both male and female flowers, with the male flowers forming a loose panicle at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Sorghum is widely cultivated for its grain, which is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
