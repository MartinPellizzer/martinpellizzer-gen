    "intro": "Potentilla richardii, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Potentilla richardii is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suited for alpine and woodland habitats."
