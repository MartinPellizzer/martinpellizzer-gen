    "intro": "Pseudomorus brunoniana var. tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian ghost fern, is a variant of the ghost fern species native to the South Pacific. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil surfaces. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
