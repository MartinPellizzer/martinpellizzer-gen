    "intro": "Polypodium tenericaule, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium tenericaule thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
