    "intro": "Paronychia nudata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Paronychia nudata is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes."
