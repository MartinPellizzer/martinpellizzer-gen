    "intro": "Polygala leucocarpa, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Polygala leucocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
