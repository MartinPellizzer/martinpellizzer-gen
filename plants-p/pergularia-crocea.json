    "intro": "Pergularia crocea, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry meadows. Pergularia crocea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
