    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. chondroides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a fern species native to North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense mats on rocky substrates. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as cliffs, rock walls, and forest floors. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
