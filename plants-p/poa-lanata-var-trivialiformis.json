    "intro": "Poa lanata var. trivialiformis, commonly known as the soft hair grass, is a variant of the woolly bluegrass species. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually a vibrant green, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other grasses. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
