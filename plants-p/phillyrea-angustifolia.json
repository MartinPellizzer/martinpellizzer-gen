It features dense, dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats. Phillyrea angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
