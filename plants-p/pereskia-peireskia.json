    "intro": "Pereskia peireskia, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as pitayas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are often used for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance. Pereskia peireskia is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
