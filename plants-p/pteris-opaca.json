    "intro": "Pteris opaca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris opaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings."
