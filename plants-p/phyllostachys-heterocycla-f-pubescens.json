It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded or partially sunny conditions. It produces small, fragrant panicles of white flowers in late summer, followed by ornamental, edible bamboo shoots. The plant is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and suitability in garden landscapes."
