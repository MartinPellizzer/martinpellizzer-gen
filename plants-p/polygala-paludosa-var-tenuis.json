    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender swamp milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy or peaty soils. The plant features slender, often branched stems and small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. This variety is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to other varieties of Polygala paludosa."
