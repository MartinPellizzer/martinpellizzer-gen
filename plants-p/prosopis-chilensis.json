    "intro": "Prosopis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets, and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by long, flat pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for windbreaks and in reforestation projects. The tree is also valued for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock."
