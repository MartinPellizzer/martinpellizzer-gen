    "intro": "Psilurus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy psilurus, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Psilurus hirtellus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
