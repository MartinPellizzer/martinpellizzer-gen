    "intro": "Phoradendron retrophyllum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and Mexico. It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, forming dense clusters on its host. The plant's parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an ecologically significant component of its native ecosystems."
