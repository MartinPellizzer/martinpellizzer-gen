    "intro": "Pterocypsela sonchus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broadly oval, hairy leaves that are usually lobed or toothed. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its fruit is a small, hairy achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Pterocypsela sonchus is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
