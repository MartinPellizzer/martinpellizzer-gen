    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. vestina, commonly known as the velvet butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, with a velvety texture that gives it its common name. It produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months."
