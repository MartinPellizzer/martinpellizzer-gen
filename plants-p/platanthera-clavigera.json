    "intro": "Platanthera clavigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, which is a common trait among orchids. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
