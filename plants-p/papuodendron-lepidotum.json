    "intro": "Papuodendron lepidotum, commonly known as the Papuan satinwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the lowland and montane forests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by reddish-brown capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
