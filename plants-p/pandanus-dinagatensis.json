    "intro": "Pandanus dinagatensis, commonly known as the Dinagat pandanus, is a rare and unique species native to the Dinagat Islands in the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a dense rosette structure. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its fibrous leaves are valued for their strength and durability, making them useful in basket weaving and thatching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
