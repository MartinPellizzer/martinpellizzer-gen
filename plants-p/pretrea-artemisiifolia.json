    "intro": "Pretrea artemisiifolia, commonly known as common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of wormwood. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its allergenic properties. Common ragweed thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It is considered a weed but also plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
