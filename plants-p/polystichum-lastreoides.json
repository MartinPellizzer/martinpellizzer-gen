    "intro": "Polystichum lastreoides, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum lastreoides is a perennial plant that exhibits a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
