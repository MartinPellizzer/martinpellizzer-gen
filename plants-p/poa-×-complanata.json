It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
