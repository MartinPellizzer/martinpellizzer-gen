    "intro": "Piper firmolimbum var. parvilimbum, commonly known as the small-leaved pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are often glabrous or sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically reddish when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variant is notable for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a spice due to its aromatic properties."
