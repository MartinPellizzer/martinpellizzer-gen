    "intro": "Parosela abietifolia, commonly known as the mountain fir lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly firs, in mountainous regions. The thallus is usually greenish-gray, with a leathery texture, and it forms dense mats on the tree surface. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
