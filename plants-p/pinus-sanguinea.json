    "intro": "Pinus sanguinea, commonly known as the Spanish red pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long. The tree produces small, purple-cone-shaped seed cones that mature over a period of two years. Its botanical features include a straight, cylindrical trunk and a conical crown that becomes more open with age. Pinus sanguinea is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
