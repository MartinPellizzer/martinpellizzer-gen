    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii subsp. minor, commonly known as the Douglas's pogogyne, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. It has a limited geographic range, primarily in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
