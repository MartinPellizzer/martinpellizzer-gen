    "intro": "Pleurogyne fontana, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette shape, with a purple-tinged stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense populations in water bodies. Pleurogyne fontana is often considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its ability to outcompete native plants."
