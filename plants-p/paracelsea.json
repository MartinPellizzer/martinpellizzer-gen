    "intro": "Paracelsea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an ethereal glow, especially under moonlight. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Paracelsea blooms only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
