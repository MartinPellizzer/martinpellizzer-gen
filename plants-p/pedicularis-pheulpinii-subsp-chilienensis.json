    "intro": "Pedicularis pheulpinii subsp. chilienensis, commonly known as the Chilian monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native range."
