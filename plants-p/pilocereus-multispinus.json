    "intro": "Pilocereus multispinus, commonly known as the star cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
