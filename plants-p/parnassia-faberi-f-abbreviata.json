    "intro": "Parnassia faberi f. abbreviata, commonly known as the abbreviated white crowfoot, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces a short, unbranched stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
