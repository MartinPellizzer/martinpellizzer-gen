    "intro": "Poa douglasii var. macrantha, commonly known as Douglas's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-ranked flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest understories. This variety is distinguished by its larger inflorescence compared to other varieties of Poa douglasii."
