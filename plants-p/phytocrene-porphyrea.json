    "intro": "Phytocrene porphyrea, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a strikingly colorful flowering plant native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple and red petals that resemble flames. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a unique root system that helps it absorb nutrients efficiently. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Phytocrene porphyrea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
