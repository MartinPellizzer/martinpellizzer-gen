    "intro": "Pedicularis rex subsp. parva, commonly known as the dwarf crownfire lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. Native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps, it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
