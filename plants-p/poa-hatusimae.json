    "intro": "Poa hatusimae, commonly known as the Hatusima bentgrass, is a rare and endemic grass species found exclusively in specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa hatusimae is considered a conservation concern."
