    "intro": "Pachira alba, commonly known as the Mexican money plant or Brazilian money tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and distinctive, palm-like roots. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into woody capsules containing seeds. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Pachira alba is also popular for its symbolic association with good fortune and prosperity."
