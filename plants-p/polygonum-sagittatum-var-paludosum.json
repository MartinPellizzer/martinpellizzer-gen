    "intro": "Polygonum sagittatum var. paludosum, commonly known as arrowhead or swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
