    "intro": "Priva, commonly known as privet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It consists of shrubs and small trees native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and oval in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, white or yellow, and clustered in umbels, often followed by small, round berries. Privet is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth and adaptability to various soil conditions."
