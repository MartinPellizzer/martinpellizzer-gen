It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in a spike. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
