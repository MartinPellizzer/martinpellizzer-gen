It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
