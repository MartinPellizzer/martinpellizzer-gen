It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.
