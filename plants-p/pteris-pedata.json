    "intro": "Pteris pedata, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that produce upright, slender fronds with a distinctive, wavy appearance. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with pinnae that are often curled or twisted, giving the plant a unique, almost animated look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
