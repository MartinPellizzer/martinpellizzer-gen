    "intro": "Polypodium spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Polypodium spathulifolium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
