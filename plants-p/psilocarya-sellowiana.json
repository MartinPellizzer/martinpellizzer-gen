    "intro": "Psilocarya sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's psilocybe, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to South America. It belongs to the Psilocybe genus and is characterized by its cap, which ranges from convex to flat with a distinct umbo. The gills are closely spaced and typically pale to brown in color, while the stem is slender and often covered in a fibrous layer. This species contains psilocybin and psilocin, psychoactive compounds that induce hallucinogenic effects. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly in areas with decomposing wood."
