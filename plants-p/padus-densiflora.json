    "intro": "Padus densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with stout branches. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are followed by red or yellow berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. It is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
