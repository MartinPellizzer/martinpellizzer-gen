    "intro": "Poa alchanaica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Poa alchanaica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
