It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
