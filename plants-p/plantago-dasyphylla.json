    "intro": "Plantago dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
