    "intro": "Poa loliacea, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in grassland ecosystems. Poa loliacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
