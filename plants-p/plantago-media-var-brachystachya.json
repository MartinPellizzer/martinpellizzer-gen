    "intro": "Plantago media var. brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are shorter than those of the typical Plantago media. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
