    "intro": "Pinus jostii, commonly known as the Jost pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fire and harsh environmental conditions. Pinus jostii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, offering shelter and food to various wildlife species."
