    "intro": "Polypodium macbridense, commonly known as the MacBride's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Polypodium macbridense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
