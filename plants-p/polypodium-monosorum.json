    "intro": "Polypodium monosorum, commonly known as the single-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium monosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
