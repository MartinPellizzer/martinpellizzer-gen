    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. kristofiana, commonly known as the Kristofiana cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high alpine regions of the Andes. It features woody stems that are often covered in dense, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five, which is characteristic of the Potentilla genus. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
