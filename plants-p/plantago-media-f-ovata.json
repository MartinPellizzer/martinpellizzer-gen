    "intro": "Plantago media f. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike during the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
