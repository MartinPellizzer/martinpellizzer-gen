    "intro": "Polystemma, commonly known as the \"water fern,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Polystichaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Polystemma species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
