    "intro": "Pyrrosia dimorpha, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, bifurcated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pyrrosia dimorpha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
