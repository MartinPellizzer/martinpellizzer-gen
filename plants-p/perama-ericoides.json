    "intro": "Perama ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Perama ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
