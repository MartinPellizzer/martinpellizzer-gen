    "intro": "Paphiopedilum malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a rare and unique species native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, intricate flower structure that resembles a pouch, a characteristic feature of the genus Paphiopedilum. The plant produces dark green, strap-like leaves and has a short, thick rhizome. It blooms with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a deep red lip. Due to its limited habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
