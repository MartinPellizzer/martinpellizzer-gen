    "intro": "Potentilla ontopoda, commonly known as the mountain potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Potentilla ontopoda is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
