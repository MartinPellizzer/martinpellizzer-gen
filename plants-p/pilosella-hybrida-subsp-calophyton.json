    "intro": "Pilosella hybrida subsp. calophyton, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
