    "intro": "Parasia gracilis, commonly known as the slender parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on the roots of other plants, often in forest understories where light is limited. Its small, delicate flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it is found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a parasite and a potential host for other organisms."
