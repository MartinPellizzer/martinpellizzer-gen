    "intro": "Panicum dichotomiflorum var. puritanorum, commonly known as the Puritan grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are released by wind, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
