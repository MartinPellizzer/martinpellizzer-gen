    "intro": "Podophyllum aurantiocaule, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed podophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features upright, branching stems that are distinctly yellow or orange in color, which stand out during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, followed by bright red berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Podophyllum aurantiocaule thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
