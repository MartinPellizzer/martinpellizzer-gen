    "intro": "Polythecium thomasianum, commonly known as the Thomasian polypody, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, lanceolate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. The leaves are usually leathery and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
