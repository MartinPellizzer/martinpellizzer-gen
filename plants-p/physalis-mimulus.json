    "intro": "Physalis mimulus, commonly known as the common groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are encased in a papery, inflated calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. These fruits are edible when fully ripe and are often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower habitats."
