It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or red, typically in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
