    "intro": "Pyrus eximia, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a species of pear native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by fruit that ripens to a pale yellow or white color. The fruit is typically small, about 2\u20133 cm in diameter, and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
