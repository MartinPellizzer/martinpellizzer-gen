    "intro": "Plantago major f. asiatica, commonly known as the Asiatic plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its broader leaves and slightly different growth habits. It is a perennial herb native to Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture and protect against herbivores. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
