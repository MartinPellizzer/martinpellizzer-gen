    "intro": "Parsonsia lata, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and tropical gardens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
