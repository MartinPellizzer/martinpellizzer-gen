    "intro": "Parinari capensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in dry savanna environments. The wood is hard and heavy, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
