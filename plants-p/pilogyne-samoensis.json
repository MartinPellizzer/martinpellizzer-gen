    "intro": "Pilogyne samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan pilogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific island of Samoa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and thrives in sandy soils with ample sunlight. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pilogyne samoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
