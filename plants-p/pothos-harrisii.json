    "intro": "Pothos harrisii, commonly known as the Hawaiian pothos, is a climbing vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest edges or on trees. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
