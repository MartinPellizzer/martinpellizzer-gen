    "intro": "Piper debile, commonly known as the slender pepper plant, is a species of flowering vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Piper debile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can also be used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
