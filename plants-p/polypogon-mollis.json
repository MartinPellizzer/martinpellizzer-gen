    "intro": "Polypogon mollis, commonly known as hairy grass or slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Polypogon mollis is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
