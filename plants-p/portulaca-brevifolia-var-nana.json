    "intro": "Portulaca brevifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf portulaca, is a compact, mat-forming annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, enabling it to survive in dry conditions."
