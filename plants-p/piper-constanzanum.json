    "intro": "Piper constanzanum, commonly known as the Peruvian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The berries are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are not as widely cultivated as other piper species."
