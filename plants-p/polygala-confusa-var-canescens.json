    "intro": "Polygala confusa var. canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
