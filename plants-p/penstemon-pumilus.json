    "intro": "Penstemon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf beardtongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, featuring dense clusters of tubular, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to rocky and dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Penstemon pumilus is also valued for its role in supporting native pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
