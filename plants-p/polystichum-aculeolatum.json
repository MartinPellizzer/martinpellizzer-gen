    "intro": "Polystichum aculeolatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are densely covered with small, spine-like structures called aculeoli. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
