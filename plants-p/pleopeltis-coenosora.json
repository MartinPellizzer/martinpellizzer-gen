    "intro": "Pleopeltis coenosora, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, broad, and leathery frond with a prominent midrib and a dense network of veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Pleopeltis coenosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
