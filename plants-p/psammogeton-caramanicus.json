    "intro": "Psammogeton caramanicus, commonly known as the Caramanic sand grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Psammogeton caramanicus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
