It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish-green seed heads that are often used in ornamental landscaping. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
