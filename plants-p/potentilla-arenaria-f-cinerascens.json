    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens form of sand potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
