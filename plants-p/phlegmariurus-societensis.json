    "intro": "Phlegmariurus societensis, commonly known as the Socotra candelabrum, is a unique liverwort species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure that resembles a candelabrum, with multiple upright stems and leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, showcasing adaptations to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its morphology includes a dense, cushion-like growth form with a dark green coloration. Phlegmariurus societensis is an example of the evolutionary adaptations seen in liverworts, particularly in isolated ecosystems."
