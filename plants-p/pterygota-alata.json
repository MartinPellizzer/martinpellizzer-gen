It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that have a wing-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like structures along the margins. Pterygota alata is often found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests."
