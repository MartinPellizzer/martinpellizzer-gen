    "intro": "Phoradendron falcatum, commonly known as the evergreen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Palo de Rosa* (*Palo de Rosa* is a common name for *Byrsonima crassifolia*). It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with small, scale-like leaves and a complex system of haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Phoradendron falcatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
