    "intro": "Populus haoana var. haoana, commonly known as the Hawaiian poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
