    "intro": "Pocockia graeca, commonly known as the Greek rock cress, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Pocockia graeca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
