    "intro": "Pelargonium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves with a net-like venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Pelargonium reticulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
