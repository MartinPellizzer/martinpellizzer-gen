It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine, silky down, while its stems are usually unbranched and slightly hairy. The flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to the high-altitude landscape."
