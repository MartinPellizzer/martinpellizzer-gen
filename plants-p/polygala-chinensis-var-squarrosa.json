It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and the flowers are often pink or purple in color. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive squarrose (spread-out) inflorescences, which give it its specific name."
