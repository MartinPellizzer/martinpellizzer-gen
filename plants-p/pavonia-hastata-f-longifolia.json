It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant features showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. The foliage is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture."
