    "intro": "Plagius, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Plagius species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. They are carnivorous plants, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement their nutrient intake. The leaves of Plagius are often submerged, with specialized structures that aid in both photosynthesis and prey capture."
