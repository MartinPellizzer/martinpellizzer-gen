    "intro": "Pothos pugnax, commonly known as the war club pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green, often with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises."
