    "intro": "Phaseolus inaequifolius, commonly known as the unequal-leaf bean, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are rich in protein and essential nutrients. This plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is well-suited for growing in well-drained soils."
