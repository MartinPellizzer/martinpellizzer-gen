It features a spiny, ribbed stem with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
