    "intro": "Polygonum coarctatum, commonly known as narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink to red and bloom in late summer. Polygonum coarctatum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a weed and a useful plant in ecological restoration."
