It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. This species thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable environmental conditions."
