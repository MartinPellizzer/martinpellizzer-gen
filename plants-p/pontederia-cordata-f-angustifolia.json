    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form. It is an aquatic plant native to the Americas and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features showy blue-violet flowers that bloom above the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. The species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
