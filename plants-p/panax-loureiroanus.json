    "intro": "Panax loureiroanus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
