    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. coronensis, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is noted for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce numerous blooms throughout the growing season."
