    "intro": "Polypodium haenkei, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often climbing or epiphytic on trees. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Polypodium haenkei plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
