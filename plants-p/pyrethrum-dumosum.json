    "intro": "Pyrethrum dumosum, commonly known as the woolly pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, thread-like structures called pharagogs. These pharagogs contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, which are used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum dumosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
