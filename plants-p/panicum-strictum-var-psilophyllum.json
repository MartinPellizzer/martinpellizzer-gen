    "intro": "Panicum strictum var. psilophyllum, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
