It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
