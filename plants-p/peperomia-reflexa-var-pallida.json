It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are pale green with a bluish tint, giving it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in both home and office settings."
