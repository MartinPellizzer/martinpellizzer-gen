    "intro": "Pauridia vaginata var. vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
