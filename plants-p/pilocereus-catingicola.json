    "intro": "Pilocereus catingicola, commonly known as the Catinga night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
