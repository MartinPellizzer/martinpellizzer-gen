It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
