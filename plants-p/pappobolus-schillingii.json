It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature typical of many members of its family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
