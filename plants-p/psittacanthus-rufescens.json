    "intro": "Psittacanthus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed h\u517b\u6210, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and striking, reddish-brown stems that become more prominent with age. The plant produces large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine due to their purported health benefits. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is relatively uncommon in horticultural trade compared to other palms."
