    "intro": "Pteris nigra, commonly known as the black maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically triangular in shape. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Pteris nigra thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental horticulture."
