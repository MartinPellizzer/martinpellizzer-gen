    "intro": "Plantago major var. altissima, commonly known as tall plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its taller growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which give them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It is known for its medicinal properties, with the leaves historically used to treat wounds and skin irritations."
