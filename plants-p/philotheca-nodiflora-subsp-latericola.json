It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
