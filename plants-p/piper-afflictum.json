    "intro": "Piper afflictum, commonly known as the sickly pepper vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Piper genus."
