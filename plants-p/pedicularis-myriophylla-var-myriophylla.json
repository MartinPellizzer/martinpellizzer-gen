    "intro": "Pedicularis myriophylla var. myriophylla, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. The species is notable for its unique floral structure, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
