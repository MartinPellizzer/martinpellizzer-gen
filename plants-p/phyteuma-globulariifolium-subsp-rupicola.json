    "intro": "Phyteuma globulariifolium subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock phyteuma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped foliage and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and water retention. This subspecies is valued in rock gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
