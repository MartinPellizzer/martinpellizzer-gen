    "intro": "Pedilonum calyptratum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are usually a mix of white, purple, and green hues. Due to its limited habitat and specialized needs, Pedilonum calyptratum is considered a conservation concern."
