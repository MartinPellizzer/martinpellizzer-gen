    "intro": "Piptocarpha poeppigiana, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Piptocarpha poeppigiana is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing desert soils."
