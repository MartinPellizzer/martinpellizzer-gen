    "intro": "Pachycereus chrysomallus, commonly known as the golden column cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are covered in a layer of white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
