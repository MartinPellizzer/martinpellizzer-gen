    "intro": "Prosthechea concolor, commonly known as the green orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually elongated and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Prosthechea concolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
