    "intro": "Phyllostegia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing along rocky shores or in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
