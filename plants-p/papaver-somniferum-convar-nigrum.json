    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. nigrum, commonly known as the black poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its dark, almost black petals. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces distinctive, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to black, often with a contrasting white or yellow center. Its botanical features include a taproot system and capsule fruits that contain the latex used in opium production. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical significance in pharmaceutical and medicinal contexts."
