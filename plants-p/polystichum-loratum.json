    "intro": "Polystichum loratum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they are produced in the first year and mature in the second before dying. Polystichum loratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, evergreen foliage."
