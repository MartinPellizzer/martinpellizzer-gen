It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
