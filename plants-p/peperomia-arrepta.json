It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery or white underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Peperomia arrepta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
