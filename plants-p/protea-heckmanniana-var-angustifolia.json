It is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment.
