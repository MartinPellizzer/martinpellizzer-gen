    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris subtriangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically narrow and triangular in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
