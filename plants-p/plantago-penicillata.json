    "intro": "Plantago penicillata, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters called inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous root system and ability to spread vegetatively make it a resilient and common species in many ecosystems."
