    "intro": "Panicum alectorocnemum, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
