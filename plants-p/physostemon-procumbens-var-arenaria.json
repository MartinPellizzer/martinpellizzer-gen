    "intro": "Physostemon procumbens var. arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features sprawling stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Sand verbena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
