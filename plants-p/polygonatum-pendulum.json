    "intro": "Polygonatum pendulum, commonly known as hanging Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features long, arching stems that hang downward, often bearing clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that ripen to a dark purple color, which are edible but not commonly consumed. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Polygonatum pendulum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
