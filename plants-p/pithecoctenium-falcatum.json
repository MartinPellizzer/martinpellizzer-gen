    "intro": "Pithecoctenium falcatum, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Pithecoctenium falcatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some regions."
