    "intro": "Pinus henryi subsp. averyanovii, commonly known as the Averyanov's pine, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The cones of this subspecies are small, woody, and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
