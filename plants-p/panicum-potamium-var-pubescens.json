    "intro": "Panicum potamium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water grass, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, leaf-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which aids in water retention and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
