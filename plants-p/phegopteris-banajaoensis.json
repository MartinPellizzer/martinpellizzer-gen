    "intro": "Phegopteris banajaoensis, commonly known as the Banjar fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy roots, which help in water absorption. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat."
