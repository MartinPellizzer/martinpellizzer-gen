    "intro": "Peperomia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbe's peperomia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Brazil. This compact shrub typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. Peperomia forbesii thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
