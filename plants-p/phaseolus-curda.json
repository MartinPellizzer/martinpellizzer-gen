    "intro": "Phaseolus curda, commonly known as the scarlet runner bean, is a tropical legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers and edible, cylindrical pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, reaching lengths of up to 3 meters, with trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive organs. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible beans."
