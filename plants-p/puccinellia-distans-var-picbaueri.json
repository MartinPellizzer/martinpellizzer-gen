    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. picbaueri, commonly known as the dwarf puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, saline environments. The plant has compact growth habit with short, creeping stems and small, narrow leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually borne in clusters at the base of the plant, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
