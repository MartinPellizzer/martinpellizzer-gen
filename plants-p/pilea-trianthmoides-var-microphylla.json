    "intro": "Pilea trianthmoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or pancake plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and compact form make it ideal for tabletop displays or hanging baskets."
