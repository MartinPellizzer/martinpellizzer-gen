    "intro": "Peperomia victoriana var. margaritana, commonly known as the \"Coral Peperomia,\" is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container cultivation."
