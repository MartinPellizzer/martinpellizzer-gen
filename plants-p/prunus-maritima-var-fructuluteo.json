    "intro": "Prunus maritima var. fructuluteo, commonly known as the yellow-fruited beach plum, is a variant of the beach plum native to coastal regions of eastern North America. It is a small, deciduous shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, which ripens in late summer, is yellow or orange and contains a single, hard pit. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing food for various wildlife species."
