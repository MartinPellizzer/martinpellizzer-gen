    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus var. pseudostrobus, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
