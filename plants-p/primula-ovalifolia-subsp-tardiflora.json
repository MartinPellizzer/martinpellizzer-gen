    "intro": "Primula ovalifolia subsp. tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering ovalleaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. This subspecies is notable for its delayed flowering compared to other members of the Primula genus."
