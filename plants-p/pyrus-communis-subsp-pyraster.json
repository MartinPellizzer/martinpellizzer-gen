    "intro": "Pyrus communis subsp. pyraster, commonly known as the common medlar, is a subspecies of the common pear that is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit, which ripens in autumn, is typically a hard, astringent berry that requires a process called \"bletting\" to soften and develop its characteristic flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rosaceae family."
