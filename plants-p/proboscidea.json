    "intro": "Proboscidea, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of white flowers and has a thick, hairy stem that contains toxic sap. Its name comes from the long, tube-like structure of its flowers, which resemble a proboscis. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
