It is characterized by its tufted clumps of slender, arching stems that produce delicate, fluffy plumes during the flowering season. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest to gardens. Pennisetum henryanum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract birds and butterflies."
