    "intro": "Pellaea angulosa, commonly known as the angular holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, angular fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique serrated edge that sets it apart from other fern species. Pellaea angulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
