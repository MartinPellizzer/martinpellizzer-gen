    "intro": "Pterostylis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, greenish-white flower with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a complex pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
