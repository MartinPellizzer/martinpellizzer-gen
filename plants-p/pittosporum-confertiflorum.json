It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
