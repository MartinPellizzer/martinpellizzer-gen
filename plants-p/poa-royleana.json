    "intro": "Poa royleana, commonly known as the Himalayan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa royleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
