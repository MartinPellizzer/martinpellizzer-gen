    "intro": "Pleopeltis squalida, commonly known as the stinking spleenwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of white or yellowish moss. This plant typically grows on shaded, moist rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively large and prominent compared to other mosses. Pleopeltis squalida is often found in humid environments, where it thrives in the presence of consistent moisture and indirect sunlight."
