    "intro": "Peucedanum porphyroscias var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features large, compound leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure, and its flowers are arranged in umbels, often with white or pale pink petals. It produces a strong, aromatic odor, and its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits. Due to its potential to cause skin irritation, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
