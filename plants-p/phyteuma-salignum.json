    "intro": "Phyteuma salignum, commonly known as the salt marsh bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Phyteuma salignum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in harsh maritime habitats."
