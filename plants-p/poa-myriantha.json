    "intro": "Poa myriantha, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Poa myriantha is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
