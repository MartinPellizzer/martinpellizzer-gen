    "intro": "Phleum lima, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Phleum lima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
