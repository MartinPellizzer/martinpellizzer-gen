    "intro": "Prunus regia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. Its fruit is a small, hard cherry that is not typically eaten by humans but is used in traditional Japanese medicine. Prunus regia is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks around the world."
