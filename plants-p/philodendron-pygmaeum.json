    "intro": "Philodendron pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature philodendron, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically small, often no larger than a few inches in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually hidden among its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
