    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria spicata subsp. inermis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, awl-shaped spikelets. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
