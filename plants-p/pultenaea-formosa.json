    "intro": "Pultenaea formosa, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often spiny branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring and are accompanied by small, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands. Pultenaea formosa is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
