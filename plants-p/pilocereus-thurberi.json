    "intro": "Pilocereus thurberi, commonly known as the Thornless Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the night-blooming cereus group. Its stems are covered in small, soft spines, which are less pronounced than those of other cactus species. Pilocereus thurberi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
