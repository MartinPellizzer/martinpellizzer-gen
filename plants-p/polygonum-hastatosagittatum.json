    "intro": "Polygonum hastatosagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in some areas."
