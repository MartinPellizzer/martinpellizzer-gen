    "intro": "Pilosocereus catingicola subsp. salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Central America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
