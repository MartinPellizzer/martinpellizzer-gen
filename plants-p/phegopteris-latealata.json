    "intro": "Phegopteris latealata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Phegopteris latealata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
