    "intro": "Pyrus esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a yellowish-green skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces small, white flowers in the spring. It is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
