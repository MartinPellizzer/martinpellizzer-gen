    "intro": "Psammisia pinnata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse seeds by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep taproots and succulent leaves. Psammisia pinnata is often found in sandy soils and is considered a resilient, drought-tolerant species."
