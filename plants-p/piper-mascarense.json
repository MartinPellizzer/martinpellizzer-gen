It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines with small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing a spicy, peppery flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
