It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, making it a dramatic sight in its natural habitat. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of the Andes.
