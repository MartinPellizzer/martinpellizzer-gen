It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
