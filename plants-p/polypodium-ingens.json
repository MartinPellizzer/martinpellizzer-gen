    "intro": "Polypodium ingens, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is thick and woody, providing structural support. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
