    "intro": "Primula tenella, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and prefers partial to full shade. Primula tenella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
