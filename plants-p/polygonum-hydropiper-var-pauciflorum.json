    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. pauciflorum, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
