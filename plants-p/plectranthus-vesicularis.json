    "intro": "Plectranthus vesicularis, commonly known as the velvetleaf plectranthus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
