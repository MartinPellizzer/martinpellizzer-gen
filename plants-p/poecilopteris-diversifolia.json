    "intro": "Poecilopteris diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that exhibit a striking variegation of green and golden hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky outcrops and forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Poecilopteris diversifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
