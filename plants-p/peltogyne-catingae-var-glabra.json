    "intro": "Peltogyne catingae var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth peltogyne, is a species of leguminous tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forest and savanna ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in degraded areas."
