    "intro": "Pitcairnia clarkii, commonly known as Clark's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia clarkii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
