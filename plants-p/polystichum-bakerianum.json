    "intro": "Polystichum bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually shorter and more robust than the sterile ones. Polystichum bakerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
