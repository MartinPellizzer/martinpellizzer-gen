    "intro": "Passerina lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with prominent, recurved petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often tinged with purple. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other early-season pollinators. Passerina lateriflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
