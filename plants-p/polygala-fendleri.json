    "intro": "Polygala fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its unique, often spiraled flower clusters. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, desert conditions. Polygala fendleri is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
