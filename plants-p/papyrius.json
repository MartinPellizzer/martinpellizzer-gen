    "intro": "Papyrius, commonly known as water caltrop, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, round, floating fruit that resembles a small shield. The plant has long, thin roots that anchor it in muddy substrates, while its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like. The fruit contains a single, hard-shelled nut inside, which is edible when properly prepared. Papyrius plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
