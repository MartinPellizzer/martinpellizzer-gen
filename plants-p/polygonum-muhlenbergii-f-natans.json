    "intro": "Polygonum muhlenbergii f. natans, commonly known as floating knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats on the water surface. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and appear in late summer to early autumn. This plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
