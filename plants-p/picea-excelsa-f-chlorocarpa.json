    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the dark green spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is more intensely colored than the typical white spruce. This form is often found in high-altitude regions where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. The cones are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the standard species. It plays an important ecological role in mountainous forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
