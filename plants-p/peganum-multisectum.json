    "intro": "Peganum multisectum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, pale green or yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its thick, fleshy leaves and stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Peganum multisectum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
