    "intro": "Physalis stapelioides, commonly known as the ghost pepper plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that transition from white to yellow as they mature. The plant's fruit, often called a \"ghost pepper,\" is small, red, and has a mild, sweet taste with a hint of heat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unusual appearance and drought tolerance."
