    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. subrotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its broadly oval, rounded leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to typical pear varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller and more tart than those of the common pear. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. This variety is relatively hardy and adaptable to a range of growing conditions."
