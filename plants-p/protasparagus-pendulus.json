    "intro": "Protasparagus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging asparagus, is a climbing plant native to South Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that trail along the ground or climb supports, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
