It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
