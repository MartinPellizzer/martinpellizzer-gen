It features thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are arranged in a distinctive zigzag pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Piperaceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a versatile and low-maintenance plant for both novice and experienced growers."
