    "intro": "Postia, commonly known as the common earth tongue, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Merulaceae. These fungi are typically found in decaying wood, where they play a vital role in the decomposition process. Postia species are characterized by their soft, sponge-like texture and their ability to thrive in moist environments. They are often mistaken for mushrooms due to their appearance but are actually more closely related to bracket fungi. The genus includes several species, each with slightly different morphological features, but they all share similar ecological functions in forest ecosystems."
