    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. pubifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom with pubescent leaves, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that are covered in a soft, pubescent (hairy) layer. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is a symbol of transience in Japanese culture. The foliage turns a vibrant red in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal."
