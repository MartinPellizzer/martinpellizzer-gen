    "intro": "Phaca arenicola, commonly known as the sand fritillary, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by the wind. Phaca arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
