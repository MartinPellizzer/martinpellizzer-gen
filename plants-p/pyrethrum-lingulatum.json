    "intro": "Pyrethrum lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insecticidal properties. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pyrethrum lingulatum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of natural pesticides."
