    "intro": "Pleurothallis pardipes, commonly known as the golden pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the humid air. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
