    "intro": "Phymatodes sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland phymatode, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its role in supporting local insect populations."
