    "intro": "Primula veris, commonly known as the cowslip, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and upright. The cowslip is an important early nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
