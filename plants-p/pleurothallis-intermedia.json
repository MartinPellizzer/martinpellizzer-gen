    "intro": "Pleurothallis intermedia, commonly known as the green-tipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, and its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
