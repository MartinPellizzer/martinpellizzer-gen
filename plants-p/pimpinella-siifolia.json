    "intro": "Pimpinella siifolia, commonly known as the Indian cumin or wild cumin, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cumin, though it has a more delicate flavor. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and culinary contexts."
