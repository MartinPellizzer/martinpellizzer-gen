    "intro": "Prasophyllum giganteum, commonly known as the giant leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, particularly in the south-eastern regions of Australia. The plant features a rosette of broad, strap-like leaves and produces tall spikes of white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
