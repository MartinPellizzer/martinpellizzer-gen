    "intro": "Portulacaria afra f. macrophylla, commonly known as the elephant bush or glossy jade plant, is a compact, shrub-like succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy, glossy appearance. The leaves are broader and more elongated compared to the typical species, giving it a distinctive, almost jade-like appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, though this is less prominent in cultivated forms. This plant is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
