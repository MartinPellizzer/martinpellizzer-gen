    "intro": "Ptelea nucifera, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, orange-to-red fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy foliage and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
