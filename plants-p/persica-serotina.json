    "intro": "Persica serotina, commonly known as the late almond. It is a species of peach native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, oval leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The fruit is a small, hairy drupe that ripens in late summer, often used for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
