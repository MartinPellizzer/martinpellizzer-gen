    "intro": "Pitcairnia macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often brightly colored bracts that can reach several feet in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, supporting a diverse array of microorganisms and small animals. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
