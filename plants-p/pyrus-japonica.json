It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, white to yellowish pears that are edible. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Pyrus japonica is also valued for its role in traditional Japanese horticulture and landscape design."
