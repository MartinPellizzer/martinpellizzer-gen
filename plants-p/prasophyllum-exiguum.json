    "intro": "Prasophyllum exiguum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, narrow, grass-like leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often arranged in a spike, with a distinctive, narrow labellum. It is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
