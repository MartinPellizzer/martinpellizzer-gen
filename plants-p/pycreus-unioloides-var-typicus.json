    "intro": "Pycreus unioloides var. typicus, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water or moist soil, often in areas with partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for successful reproduction. Due to habitat loss, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
