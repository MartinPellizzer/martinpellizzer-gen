    "intro": "Plumbago glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
