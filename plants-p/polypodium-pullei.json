    "intro": "Polypodium pullei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to various substrates. Polypodium pullei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
