It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Phanera lyrata thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
