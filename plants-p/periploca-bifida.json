    "intro": "Periploca bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf periploca, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed or split, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
