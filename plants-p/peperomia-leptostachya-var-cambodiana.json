It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in clusters, which appear during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
