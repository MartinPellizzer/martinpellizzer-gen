It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
