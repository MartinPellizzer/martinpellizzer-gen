    "intro": "Prunus guanaiensis, commonly known as the Andean wineberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible berries, which are typically red or purple when ripe. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Prunus guanaiensis is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude habitats."
