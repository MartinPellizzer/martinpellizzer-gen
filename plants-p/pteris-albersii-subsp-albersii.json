    "intro": "Pteris albersii subsp. albersii, commonly known as the Albers' sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
