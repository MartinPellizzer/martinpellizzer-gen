It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine pubescence. The marsh gentian is an important nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
