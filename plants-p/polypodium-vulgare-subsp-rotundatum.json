    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf wall fern, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
