It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
