    "intro": "Pragmotessara ilicifolia, commonly known as the fragrant hollyleaf plant, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves that have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often avoided by animals due to their bitter taste. Pragmotessara ilicifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its ornamental value and unique fragrance make it a sought-after plant in horticultural collections."
