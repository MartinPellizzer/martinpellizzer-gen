    "intro": "Psychotria manambolensis, commonly known as the Madagascar psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the local ecosystem as a food source for certain insects and birds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
