    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. angustisquama, commonly known as the narrowleaf lace pine, is a variant of the Italian stone pine. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical variety. The tree produces cones that are often smaller and more compact compared to the standard species. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Apennines. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique foliage and resilience."
