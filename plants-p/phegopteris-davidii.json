    "intro": "Phegopteris davidii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is valued in both horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
