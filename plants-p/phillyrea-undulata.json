    "intro": "Phillyrea undulata, commonly known as the undulating Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. Phillyrea undulata is typically found in rocky or dry habitats and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
