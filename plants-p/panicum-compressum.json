    "intro": "Panicum compressum, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, flat leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird life. It is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
