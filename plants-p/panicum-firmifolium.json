    "intro": "Panicum firmifolium, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are visible in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a habitat for various wildlife species and is used in restoration projects."
