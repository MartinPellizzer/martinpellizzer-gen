    "intro": "Pseudocentrum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine starleaf, is a rare and unique plant species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its alpine habitat. Pseudocentrum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
