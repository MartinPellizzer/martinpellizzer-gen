    "intro": "Polypodium cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilaginous fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to store moisture and nutrients. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
