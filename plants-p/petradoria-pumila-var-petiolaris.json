    "intro": "Petradoria pumila var. petiolaris, commonly known as the small-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact size and ability to survive in harsh conditions, it is a hardy addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
