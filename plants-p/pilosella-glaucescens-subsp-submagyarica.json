    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. submagyarica, commonly known as the Hungarian goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It is distinguished by its subshrub-like growth habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
