    "intro": "Penicillaria, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. They produce bright yellow flowers that are often arranged in racemes, which are characteristic of the mustard family. Penicillaria species are often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
