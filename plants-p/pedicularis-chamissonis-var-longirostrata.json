    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis var. longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. Its flowers are tubular and often have a distinctive, elongated lower lip that gives it its common name. The species is characterized by its showy, pink to purple blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
