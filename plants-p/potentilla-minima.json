    "intro": "Potentilla minima, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has fine, silver-white hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
