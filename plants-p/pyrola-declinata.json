    "intro": "Pyrola declinata, commonly known as the drooping snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are typically oval and dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola declinata thrives in acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it can receive dappled sunlight."
