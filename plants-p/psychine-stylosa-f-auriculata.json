    "intro": "Psychine stylosa f. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate psychine, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive auriculate leaves, which have ear-like lobes at the base. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
