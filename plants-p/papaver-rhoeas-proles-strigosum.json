    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas proles strigosum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a dark central stigma, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy texture is an adaptation that may help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
