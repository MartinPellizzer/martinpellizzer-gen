It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in humid, tropical lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
