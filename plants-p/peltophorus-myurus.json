    "intro": "Peltophorus myurus, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oblong, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its invasive potential in certain environments."
