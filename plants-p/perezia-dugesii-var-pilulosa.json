It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The leaves are hairy, giving the plant its specific epithet \"pilulosa,\" which means \"little pill\" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. This variety is relatively rare and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
