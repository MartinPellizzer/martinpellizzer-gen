    "intro": "Pisum sativum subsp. pachylobum, commonly known as the thick-seeded pea, is a subspecies of the pea plant characterized by its robust, thickly lobed pods. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces edible seeds that are slightly larger and more robust than those of the common pea. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
