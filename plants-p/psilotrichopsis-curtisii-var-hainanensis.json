    "intro": "Psilotrichopsis curtisii var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and the absence of true leaves, instead bearing sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls. This plant is endemic to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary lineage, showcasing features typical of early land plants. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
