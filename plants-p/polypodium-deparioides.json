    "intro": "Polypodium deparioides, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to vertical surfaces. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
