    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pneumatopteris japonensis, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
