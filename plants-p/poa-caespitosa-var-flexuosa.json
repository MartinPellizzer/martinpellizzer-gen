    "intro": "Poa caespitosa var. flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
