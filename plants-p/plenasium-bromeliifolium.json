    "intro": "Plenasium bromeliifolium, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a rosette-forming perennial with elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, creating a compact, spiky appearance. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
