    "intro": "Prunus persica f. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowering peach. This variant of the peach tree is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two sets of petals on each flower. The botanical feature of this form lies in its double blooms, which result from a genetic mutation that causes the flower to develop an extra layer of petals. The plant retains the typical growth habits of the common peach, including its deciduous nature and fruiting characteristics. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking and showy flowers."
