    "intro": "Pteris dayakorum, commonly known as the Dayak's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Pteris dayakorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
