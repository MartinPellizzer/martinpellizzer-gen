    "intro": "Pycnandra deplanchei subsp. floribunda, commonly known as the white-flowered pycnandra, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive drought. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
