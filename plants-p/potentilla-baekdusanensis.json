    "intro": "Potentilla baekdusanensis, commonly known as the Baekdusan potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly around Mount Baekdusan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential ecological roles in alpine ecosystems."
