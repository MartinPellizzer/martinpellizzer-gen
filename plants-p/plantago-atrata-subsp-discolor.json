    "intro": "Plantago atrata subsp. discolor, commonly known as the silver plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, erect flowering stems topped with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
