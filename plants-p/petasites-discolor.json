    "intro": "Petasites discolor, commonly known as the greenish buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Petasites discolor is known for its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time."
