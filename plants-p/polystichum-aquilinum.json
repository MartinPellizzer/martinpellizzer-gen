    "intro": "Polystichum aquilinum, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky or wooded areas. Polystichum aquilinum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
