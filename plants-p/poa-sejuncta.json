    "intro": "Poa sejuncta, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually erect and bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa sejuncta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
