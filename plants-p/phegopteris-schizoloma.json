    "intro": "Phegopteris schizoloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in understory plant communities."
