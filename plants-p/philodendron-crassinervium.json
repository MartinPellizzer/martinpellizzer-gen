    "intro": "Philodendron crassinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, broad veins that give it its common name. The plant has a fibrous root system and can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in height when supported. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
