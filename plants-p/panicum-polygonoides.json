    "intro": "Panicum polygonoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Panicum polygonoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
