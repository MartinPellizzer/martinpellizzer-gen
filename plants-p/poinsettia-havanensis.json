    "intro": "Poinsettia havanensis, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet in its natural habitat. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the colorful bracts. Poinsettia havanensis thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
