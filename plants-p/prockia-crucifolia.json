    "intro": "Prockia crucifolia, commonly known as the crossleaf prockia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, four-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Prockia crucifolia is native to specific regions with moist, temperate climates, often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
