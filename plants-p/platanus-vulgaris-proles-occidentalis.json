    "intro": "Platanus vulgaris proles occidentalis, commonly known as the western plane tree, is a species of large deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the family Platanaceae and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The tree produces large, spherical clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It has a shallow, spreading root system and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. The bark is thick, ridged, and becomes deeply furrowed with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
