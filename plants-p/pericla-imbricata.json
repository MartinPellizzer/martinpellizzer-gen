    "intro": "Pericla imbricata, commonly known as the overlapping leaf plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique foliage, where the leaves are arranged in an overlapping pattern, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pericla imbricata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking leaf structure and adaptability to various growing conditions."
