    "intro": "Panicum rectum, commonly known as rigid panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Panicum rectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
