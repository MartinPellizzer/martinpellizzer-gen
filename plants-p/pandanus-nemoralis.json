    "intro": "Pandanus nemoralis, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, helping to stabilize coastal soils. Pandanus nemoralis is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching material due to its durable, fibrous leaves."
