    "intro": "Pitcairnia lanata, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, woolly white trichomes, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a tropical houseplant."
