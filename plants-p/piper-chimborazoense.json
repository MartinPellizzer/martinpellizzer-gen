    "intro": "Piper chimborazoense, commonly known as the Andean pepper, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, it remains a relatively understudied species within its ecosystem."
