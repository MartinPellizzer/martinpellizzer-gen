    "intro": "Pedicularis densispica var. typica, commonly known as the dense-spiked monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
