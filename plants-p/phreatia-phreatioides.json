    "intro": "Phreatia phreatioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are specialized to absorb water from the environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
