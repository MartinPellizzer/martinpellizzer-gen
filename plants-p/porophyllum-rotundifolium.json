It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are round and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive reddish or purplish center. Porophyllum rotundifolium is often used in traditional medicine and is also an important plant for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
