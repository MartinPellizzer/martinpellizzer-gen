    "intro": "Polymnia calicina, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcherry, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by round, greenish-brown fruits that resemble tiny tomatoes. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Polymnia calicina is often found in shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
