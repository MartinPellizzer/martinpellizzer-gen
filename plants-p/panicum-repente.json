It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and marshes. Its rapid growth rate and short life cycle make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses and cereal crops."
