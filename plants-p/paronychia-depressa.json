    "intro": "Paronychia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Botanically, it belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent stems and ability to store water."
