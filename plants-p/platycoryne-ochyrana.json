    "intro": "Platycoryne ochyrana, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients. Platycoryne ochyrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
