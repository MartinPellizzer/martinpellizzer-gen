    "intro": "Platycerium wilhelminae-reginae, commonly known as the Queen Wilhelmina's fern, is a unique epiphytic fern belonging to the family Platycerium. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a crown, which are typically dark green with a leathery texture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Platycerium wilhelminae-reginae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
