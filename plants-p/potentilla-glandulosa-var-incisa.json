    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, five-lobed leaves that are typically narrow and serrated. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
