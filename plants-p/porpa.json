    "intro": "Porpa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Porpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
