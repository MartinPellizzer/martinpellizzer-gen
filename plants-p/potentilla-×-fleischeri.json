    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 fleischeri, commonly known as the hybrid cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and compact form."
