    "intro": "Pothos schlechtendalii, commonly known as the marble queen pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive marbled pattern of light and dark green. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots and can grow quite long if given support. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
