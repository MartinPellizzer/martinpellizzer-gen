    "intro": "Pyrus paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox apple, is a rare and unusual species of apple tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish fruits that are typically no larger than a cherry. The plant has a distinctive branching pattern and produces flowers that are pale green with a subtle pinkish tinge. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and a dark green upper surface. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Pyrus paradoxa is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
