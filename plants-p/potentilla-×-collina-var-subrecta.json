    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. subrecta, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
