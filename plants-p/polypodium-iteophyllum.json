    "intro": "Polypodium iteophyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
