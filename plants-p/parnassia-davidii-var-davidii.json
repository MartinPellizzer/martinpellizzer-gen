    "intro": "Parnassia davidii var. davidii, commonly known as the David's parnassia, is a striking member of the Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It is characterized by its large, white, cup-shaped flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest understories. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a smooth, waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. This variant is native to the Himalayas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
