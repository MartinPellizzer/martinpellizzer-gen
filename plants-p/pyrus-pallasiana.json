    "intro": "Pyrus pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-sour fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
