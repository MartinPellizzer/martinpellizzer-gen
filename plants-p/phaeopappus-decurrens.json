    "intro": "Phaeopappus decurrens, commonly known as the yellow pappus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woolly bracts that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
