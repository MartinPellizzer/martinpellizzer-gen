It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and dark, hard wood, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are small and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.
