It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, rounded leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
