It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking red to orange flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores and dunes, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
