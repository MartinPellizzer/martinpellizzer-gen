    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 mulleri, commonly known as the silver leaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight effectively. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in full sun."
