    "intro": "Pouteria myrsinoides, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces a fruit that is a large, woody capsule containing seeds coated in a rich, edible pulp. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are the primary commercial product of the tree. Due to its ecological and economic importance, Pouteria myrsinoides plays a significant role in both biodiversity and local economies."
