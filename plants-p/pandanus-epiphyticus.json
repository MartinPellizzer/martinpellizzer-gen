    "intro": "Pandanus epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rainwater. Pandanus epiphyticus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
