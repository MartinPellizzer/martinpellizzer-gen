    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus oreus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its blooming cycle is triggered by specific temperature and light changes, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
