    "intro": "Polygala balduini, commonly known as the Balduin's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
