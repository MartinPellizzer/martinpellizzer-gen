    "intro": "Puya sagasteguii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the early morning and last for several weeks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya sagasteguii is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
