    "intro": "Parsonsia smithii, commonly known as the red lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. The species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and cultural practices in its native regions."
