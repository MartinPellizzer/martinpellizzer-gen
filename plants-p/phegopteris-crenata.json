    "intro": "Phegopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a delicate, feathery appearance with fronds that are divided into small, serrated segments. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. The serrated water fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
