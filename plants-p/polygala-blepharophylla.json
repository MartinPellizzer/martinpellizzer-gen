    "intro": "Polygala blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking member of the Polygalaceae family native to the southeastern United States. This perennial herb is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small and often pale, with a distinctive two-lipped structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
