    "intro": "Pruskortizia dasytricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf krigia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Pruskortizia dasytricha is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
