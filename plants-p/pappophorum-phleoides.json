    "intro": "Pappophorum phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
