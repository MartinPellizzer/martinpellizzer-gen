    "intro": "Polygala transvaalensis subsp. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal milk-vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a climbing shrub that belongs to the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. This species is often found in rocky areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
