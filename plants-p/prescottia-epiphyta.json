    "intro": "Prescottia epiphyta, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Prescottia epiphyta is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting diverse rainforest biodiversity."
