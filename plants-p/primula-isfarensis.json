    "intro": "Primula isfarensis, commonly known as the Isfahan primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
