    "intro": "Pyrrosia mannii, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens and as a houseplant."
