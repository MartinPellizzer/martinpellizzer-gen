    "intro": "Photinia hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often woolly underside. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
