It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white with a faintly colored lip. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Pleurothallis quadrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
