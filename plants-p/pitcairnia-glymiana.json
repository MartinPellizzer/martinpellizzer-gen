    "intro": "Pitcairnia glymiana, commonly known as the Crimson Pincushion, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia glymiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
