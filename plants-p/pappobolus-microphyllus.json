It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and distinctive seed heads. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that help in its propagation across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and sandy plains. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of grassland ecosystems."
