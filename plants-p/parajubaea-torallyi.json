It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are arranged in branched inflorescences, followed by black, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
