    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. major, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its taller growth habit compared to the typical form, with culms reaching up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. This form is valued for its ability to form dense turf and its resilience to various environmental conditions."
