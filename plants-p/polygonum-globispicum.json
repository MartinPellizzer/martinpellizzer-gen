    "intro": "Polygonum globispicum, commonly known as the globular knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Polygonum globispicum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
