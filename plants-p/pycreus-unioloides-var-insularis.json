It typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often in coastal or brackish areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It is characterized by its specialized adaptations to saline and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
