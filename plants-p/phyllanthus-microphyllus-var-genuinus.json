It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
