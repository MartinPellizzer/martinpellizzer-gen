    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate pine, is a variant of the Chinese pine, characterized by its unique foliage and cone structures. It is native to northern China and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically shorter and more clustered compared to the standard variety, giving it a distinct appearance. Its cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and resilience."
