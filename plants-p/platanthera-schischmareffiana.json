    "intro": "Platanthera schischmareffiana, commonly known as the Schischmareff's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a dense, dark green foliage and produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its flowers are characterized by three prominent sepals and three petals, with the latter often being hooded. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts that aid in nutrient uptake."
