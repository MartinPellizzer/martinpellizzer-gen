    "intro": "Psychrogeton primuloides, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually broad and hairy, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Psychrogeton primuloides plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in steep terrain."
