    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides monstr. geminatum, commonly known as the geminate polypody, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique morphological variation known as gemination, which refers to the production of multiple sporangia on the same sorus. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
