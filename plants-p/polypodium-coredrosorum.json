    "intro": "Polypodium coredrosorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Its rhizome is short and thick, which helps it anchor to the substrate and absorb moisture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
