    "intro": "Pleopeltis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
