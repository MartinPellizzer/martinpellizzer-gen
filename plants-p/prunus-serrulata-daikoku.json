    "intro": "Prunus serrulata daikoku, commonly known as the Daikoku cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly serrated leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its fruit, a small, dark red drupe, develops after the flowers and is edible but less commonly consumed. The Daikoku cherry is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
