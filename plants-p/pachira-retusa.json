    "intro": "Pachira retusa, commonly known as the red-stemmed pachira, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its large, heart-shaped leaves. It produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Pachira retusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
