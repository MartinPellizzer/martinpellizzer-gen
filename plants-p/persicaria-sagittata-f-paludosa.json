It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence indicates healthy wetland environments and supports a variety of pollinators and aquatic life."
