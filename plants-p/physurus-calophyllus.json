    "intro": "Physurus calophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its durable timber. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
