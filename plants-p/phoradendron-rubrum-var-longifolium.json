    "intro": "Phoradendron rubrum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and whitish on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow when ripe and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals while also impacting its host trees."
