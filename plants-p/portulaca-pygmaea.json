    "intro": "Portulaca pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the day. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, containers, and as a ground cover. Portulaca pygmaea is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to withstand drought conditions."
