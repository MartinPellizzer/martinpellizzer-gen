    "intro": "Psychotria pulchrebracteata, commonly known as the beautiful bract psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that are often brightly colored, which serve to attract pollinators. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and prominent stamens. Psychotria pulchrebracteata is also notable for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and pharmacological significance."
