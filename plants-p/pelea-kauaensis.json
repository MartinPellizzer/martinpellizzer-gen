    "intro": "Pelea kauaensis, commonly known as Kauaean pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mesic forests. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelea kauaensis is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
