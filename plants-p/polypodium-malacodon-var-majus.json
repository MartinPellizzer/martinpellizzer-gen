    "intro": "Polypodium malacodon var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in moist, tropical habitats. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
