    "intro": "Potentilla verna subsp. longifrons, commonly known as the long-fruited silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in heads and attract pollinators such as bees. Its subspecies name, *longifrons*, refers to the elongated, pointed fruits that develop after flowering. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
