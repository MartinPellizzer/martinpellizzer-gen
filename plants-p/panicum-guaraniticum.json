    "intro": "Panicum guaraniticum, commonly known as the Guarani grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
