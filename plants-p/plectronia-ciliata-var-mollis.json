It features delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its refined appearance."
