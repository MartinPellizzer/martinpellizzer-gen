    "intro": "Pterostylis fischii, commonly known as the Fischii spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It has a short-lived rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers during the spring or early summer. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species."
