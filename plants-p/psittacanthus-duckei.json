    "intro": "Psittacanthus duckei, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant's fronds are typically bright green with a waxy texture, and they can grow quite large, sometimes exceeding two meters in height. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, loose soil to anchor its roots. Psittacanthus duckei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
