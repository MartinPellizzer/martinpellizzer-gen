    "intro": "Pachyphyllum costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican thickleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are typically small and spineless, contributing to its unique appearance. Pachyphyllum costaricense is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in its native ecosystem."
