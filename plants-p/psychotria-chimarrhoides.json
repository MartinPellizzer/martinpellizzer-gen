    "intro": "Psychotria chimarrhoides, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that appear to be translucent or semi-transparent, giving it a ghostly appearance. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a strong, sweet scent. Psychotria chimarrhoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique visual appeal and air-purifying properties."
