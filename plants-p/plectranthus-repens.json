    "intro": "Plectranthus repens, commonly known as creeping fig or Mexican mint, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread horizontally make it effective for erosion control and ornamental use."
