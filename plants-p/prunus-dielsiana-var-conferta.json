    "intro": "Prunus dielsiana var. conferta, commonly known as the dense-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to ornamental landscapes."
