    "intro": "Pedicularis mayana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive monkey-like appearance. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
