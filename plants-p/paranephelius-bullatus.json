    "intro": "Paranephelius bullatus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments where it can float or remain submerged. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations."
