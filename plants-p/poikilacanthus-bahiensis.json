It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
