    "intro": "Parnassia palustris subsp. multiseta, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, and it often grows in association with other wetland flora. The subspecies multiseta is distinguished by its longer, more branched floral spurs compared to other subspecies of Parnassia palustris."
