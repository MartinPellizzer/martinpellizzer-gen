    "intro": "Psephellus leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaf psephellus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers a cool, moist environment. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in a composite head. Psephellus leptophyllus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
