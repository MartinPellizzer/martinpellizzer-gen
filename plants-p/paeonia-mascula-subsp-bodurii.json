    "intro": "Paeonia mascula subsp. bodurii, commonly known as the Bodurii peony, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and sometimes red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with thick, woody stems and palmately divided leaves. Its botanical features include a complex root system and a long dormancy period, typical of many peony species. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
