    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. kamoana, commonly known as the Kamoana cherry, is a unique horticultural form of the Prunus incisa species. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often described as \"sword-shaped.\" The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are prized for their flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and orchards in its native region."
