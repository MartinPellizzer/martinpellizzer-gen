It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with hairy veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, peppery fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
