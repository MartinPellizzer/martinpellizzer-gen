    "intro": "Pouteria eugeniifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
