    "intro": "Plantago alpina subsp. incana, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and grayish in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
