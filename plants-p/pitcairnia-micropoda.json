    "intro": "Pitcairnia micropoda, commonly known as the small-leaved pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The flowers, which are typically greenish-white, are borne on a central spike and are often hidden within the foliage. Pitcairnia micropoda is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
