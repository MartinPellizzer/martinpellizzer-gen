    "intro": "Physalis rigida, commonly known as the rough bladder nut, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of bright orange, inflated calyces that enclose small, berry-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive, lantern-like structures. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Physalis rigida is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
