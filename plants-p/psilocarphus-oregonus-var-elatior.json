    "intro": "Psilocarphus oregonus var. elatior, commonly known as the Oregon psilocybin mushroom, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae and is characterized by its cap, which ranges from white to pale yellow when young, turning a darker hue as it matures. The gills are initially white and develop a pale yellow color as the mushroom ages. It contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. This variety is often found in coniferous forests and is closely related to other psilocybin-containing species in the genus Psilocarphus."
