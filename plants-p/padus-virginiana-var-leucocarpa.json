    "intro": "Padus virginiana var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, white or pale yellow fruits in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to support local wildlife."
