    "intro": "Philodendron aureimarginatum, commonly known as the golden-margin philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a striking golden-yellow margin that contrasts beautifully with its deep green center. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care. Its vines can grow quite long, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trained on trellises."
