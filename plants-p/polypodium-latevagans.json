    "intro": "Polypodium latevagans, commonly known as the broad-veined holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae with broad, spreading veins. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance."
