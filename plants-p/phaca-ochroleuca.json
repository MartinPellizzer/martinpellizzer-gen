    "intro": "Phaca ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow lichen. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate regions. The plant has a bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found in humid environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its simple structure and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
