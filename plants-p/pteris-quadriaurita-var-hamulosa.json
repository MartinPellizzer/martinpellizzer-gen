    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. hamulosa, commonly known as the hooked water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant has finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
