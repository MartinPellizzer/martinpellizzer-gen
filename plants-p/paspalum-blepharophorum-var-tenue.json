It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, which help it thrive in disturbed soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, with pale green to brown bracts. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
