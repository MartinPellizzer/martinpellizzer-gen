    "intro": "Pseudoxandra rionegrensis, commonly known as the Rionegro pseudoxandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical, glossy, and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
