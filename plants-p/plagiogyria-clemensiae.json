    "intro": "Plagiogyria clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' plagiogyria, is a rare and delicate member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, low-lying mats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
