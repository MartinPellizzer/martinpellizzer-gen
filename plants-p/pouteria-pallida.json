    "intro": "Pouteria pallida, commonly known as the white spondias, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its fruit is often used in local cuisines and has a mild, slightly acidic flavor. Pouteria pallida is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
