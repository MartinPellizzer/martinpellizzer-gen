It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular shape and spiny appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaves and thick stems that store water. Paepalanthus similis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
