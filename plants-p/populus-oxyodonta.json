    "intro": "Populus oxyodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow. Populus oxyodonta is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
