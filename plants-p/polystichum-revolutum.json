    "intro": "Polystichum revolutum, commonly known as the curled fern or the revolute holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are rolled under at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also storing nutrients. Polystichum revolutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
