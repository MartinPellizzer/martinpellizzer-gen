It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. It has a short life cycle and is typically annual or biennial. Its leaves are succulent and contain specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms."
