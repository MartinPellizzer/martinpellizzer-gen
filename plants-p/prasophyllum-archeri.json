    "intro": "Prasophyllum archeri, commonly known as the mountain leek, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil fertility. Prasophyllum archeri is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other orchid species."
