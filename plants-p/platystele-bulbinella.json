    "intro": "Platystele bulbinella, commonly known as the bulbine flat-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Platystele bulbinella is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
