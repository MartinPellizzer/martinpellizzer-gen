    "intro": "Pilosella collina subsp. fallax, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, spoon-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are typically yellow, with five petals and a hairy center, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-altitude vegetation."
