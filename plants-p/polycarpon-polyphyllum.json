    "intro": "Polycarpon polyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polycarpon, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, pinkish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in the wild."
