    "intro": "Pentanisia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a reddish hue, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pentanisia rubricaulis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions."
