It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, cherry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a smooth, often reddish bark and a tendency to form dense thickets. Prunus amplifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and habitat for various insects."
