    "intro": "Pimpinella trachycarpum, commonly known as the roughcarp beetle plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, rough-hairy fruits, giving it its scientific name. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
