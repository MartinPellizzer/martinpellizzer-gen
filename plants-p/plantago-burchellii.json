    "intro": "Plantago burchellii, commonly known as African plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in dry, three-lobed capsules, which are adapted for wind dispersal. This species is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
