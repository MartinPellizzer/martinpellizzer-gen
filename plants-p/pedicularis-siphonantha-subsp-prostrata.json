    "intro": "Pedicularis siphonantha subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and produce clusters of small, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
