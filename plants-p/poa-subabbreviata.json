    "intro": "Poa subabbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and fine texture, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
