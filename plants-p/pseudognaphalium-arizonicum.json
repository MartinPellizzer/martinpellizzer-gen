    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona tansy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
