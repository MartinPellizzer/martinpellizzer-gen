It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and mountainous areas. Its compact form and resilience make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
