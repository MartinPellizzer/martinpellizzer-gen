    "intro": "Phyllanthus rufidulus, commonly known as the red-stemmed phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
