    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus petrophila, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky, acidic environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
