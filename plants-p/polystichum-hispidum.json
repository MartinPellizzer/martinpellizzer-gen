    "intro": "Polystichum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum hispidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
