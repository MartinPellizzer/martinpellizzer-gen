    "intro": "Panicum subhystrix, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and rhizomes that aid in its spread. Panicum subhystrix is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
