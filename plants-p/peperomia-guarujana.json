    "intro": "Peperomia guarujana, commonly known as the Brazilian peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to avoid root rot. Peperomia guarujana is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
