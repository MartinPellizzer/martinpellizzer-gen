    "intro": "Phymatopteris conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil."
