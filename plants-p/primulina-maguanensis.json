    "intro": "Primulina maguanensis, commonly known as the Maguanensis Primulina, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Panama. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetric flowers. The plant typically grows as a small herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
