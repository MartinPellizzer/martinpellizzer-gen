    "intro": "Pinus binato-folio, commonly known as the two-leaved pine, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with young shoots bearing two types of leaves\u2014needle-like and scale-like\u2014hence its specific epithet. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a narrow, conical shape and a slow growth rate. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural habitat."
