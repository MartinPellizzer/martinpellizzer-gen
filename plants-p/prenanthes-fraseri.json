    "intro": "Prenanthes fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's waterplantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers clustered in a spike. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit. Fraser's waterplantain is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
