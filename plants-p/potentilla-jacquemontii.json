    "intro": "Potentilla jacquemontii, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. Potentilla jacquemontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
