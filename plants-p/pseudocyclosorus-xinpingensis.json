    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus xinpingensis, commonly known as the Xiping water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into four lobes, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
