    "intro": "Polypodium pallidivenium, commonly known as the pale-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with pale veins. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are usually short and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
