    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. umbellosa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive, hairy leaves that are often described as mouse-eared in appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Pilosella auriculoides subsp. umbellosa is well adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of mountain vegetation."
