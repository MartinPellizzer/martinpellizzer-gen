    "intro": "Pterostylis ceriflora, commonly known as the candle-flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower. Its morphology is adapted for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
