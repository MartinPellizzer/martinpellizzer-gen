It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a drought-tolerant forage crop."
