    "intro": "Peyritschia conferta, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus, which is usually covered with a fine, powdery layer of calcium carbonate. This lichen thrives in dry, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a distinct upper cortex and a lower medulla, with a network of fungal hyphae interwoven with algal cells. Peyritschia conferta is notable for its chemical composition, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
