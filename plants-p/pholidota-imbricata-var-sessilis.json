    "intro": "Pholidota imbricata var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile pholidota, is a rare variant of the pholidota genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
