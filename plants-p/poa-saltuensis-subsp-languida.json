    "intro": "Poa saltuensis subsp. languida, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, often tufted inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, with a low-growing habit that helps it survive in harsh environments. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance and unique morphological traits."
