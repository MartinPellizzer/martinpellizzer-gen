    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. cambricum, commonly known as the Welsh fern, is a fern species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
