    "intro": "Plettkea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom on a single stem. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a mycoheterotroph, dependent on symbiotic relationships with fungi. Plettkea thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is listed as endangered in several states."
