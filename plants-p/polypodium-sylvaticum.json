    "intro": "Polypodium sylvaticum, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a vascular epiphytic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically divided into linear segments, giving it a distinctive, sword-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Polypodium sylvaticum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
