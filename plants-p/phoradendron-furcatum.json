    "intro": "Phoradendron furcatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to many animals. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its presence can weaken the host plant over time, affecting the overall health of the tree."
