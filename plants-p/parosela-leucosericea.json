It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.
