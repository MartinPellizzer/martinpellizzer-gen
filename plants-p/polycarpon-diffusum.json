    "intro": "Polycarpon diffusum, commonly known as broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, spherical berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic berries, it should be handled with care."
