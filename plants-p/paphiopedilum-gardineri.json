    "intro": "Paphiopedilum gardineri, commonly known as the Gardner's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped lip, which is a defining feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky stem and broad, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with deep red or purple markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
