    "intro": "Puccinellia tenuiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as slenderflower glassworts, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more abundant flowering and slightly different leaf morphology."
