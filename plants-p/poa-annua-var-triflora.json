    "intro": "Poa annua var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, three-flowered spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Poa annua var. triflora is often considered a weed in agricultural and turfgrass settings due to its competitive nature."
