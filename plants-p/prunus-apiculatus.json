    "intro": "Prunus apiculatus, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but are typically less sweet. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive serrated edge. Prunus apiculatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
