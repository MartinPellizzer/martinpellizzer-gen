    "intro": "Panicum compositum var. fimbriusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical leaves and compact, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in prairie habitats and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. Its foliage is often a striking blue-green color, which becomes more intense during the growing season. It is a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
