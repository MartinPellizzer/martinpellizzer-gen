    "intro": "Panicum hololeucum, commonly known as white panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white panicles that are often mistaken for dandelion fluff. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and it is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Panicum hololeucum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
