It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant has a rapid growth rate and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
