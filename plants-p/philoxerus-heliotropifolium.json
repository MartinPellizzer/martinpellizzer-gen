    "intro": "Philoxerus heliotropifolium, commonly known as the sunflower leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that are often green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, bead-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
