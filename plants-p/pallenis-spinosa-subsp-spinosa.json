    "intro": "Pallenis spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny pallenis, is a shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
