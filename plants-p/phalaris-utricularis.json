    "intro": "Phalaris utricularis, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, pond edges, and moist meadows. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
