    "intro": "Polypodium membranifolium var. subsimplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the delicate polypody fern. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, membranous appearance on the underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
