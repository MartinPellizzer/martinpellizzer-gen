    "intro": "Primula advena, commonly known as the wandering primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it an early indicator of seasonal change. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
