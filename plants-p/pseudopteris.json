    "intro": "Pseudopteris, commonly known as the false water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of true water ferns. Pseudopteris species often have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize various substrates. The genus includes several species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
