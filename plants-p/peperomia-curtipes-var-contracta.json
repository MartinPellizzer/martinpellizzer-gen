    "intro": "Peperomia curtipes var. contracta, commonly known as the compact peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ease of care and attractive appearance."
