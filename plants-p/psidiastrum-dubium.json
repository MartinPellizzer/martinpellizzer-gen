    "intro": "Psidiastrum dubium, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, round, reddish-brown fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Psidiastrum dubium is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
