    "intro": "Parapactis, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. These plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically small, oval, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Parapactis species are adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and experiencing cold temperatures."
