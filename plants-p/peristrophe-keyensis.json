    "intro": "Peristrophe keyensis, commonly known as Key Island grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found on the island of Key West. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
