    "intro": "Passiflora kumandayi, commonly known as the Ecuadorian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of red, blue, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, while its stems are woody and often have a reddish hue. Passiflora kumandayi is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
