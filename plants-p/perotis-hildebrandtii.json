    "intro": "Perotis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Perotis hildebrandtii is an important forage plant for livestock in dryland regions."
