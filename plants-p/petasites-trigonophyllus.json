    "intro": "Petasites trigonophyllus, commonly known as the giant cow wheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Petasites trigonophyllus is known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in certain habitats."
