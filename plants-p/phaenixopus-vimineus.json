    "intro": "Phaenixopus vimineus, commonly known as the creeping rosebay willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Phaenixopus vimineus thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows."
