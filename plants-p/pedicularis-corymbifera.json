    "intro": "Pedicularis corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble the shape of a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its striking floral morphology makes it a notable species in botanical gardens and alpine ecosystems."
