    "intro": "Planotia, commonly known as the flat-leaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their flat, broad leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Planotia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological roles within their native habitats."
