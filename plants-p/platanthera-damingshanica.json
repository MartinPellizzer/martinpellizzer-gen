    "intro": "Platanthera damingshanica, commonly known as the Daming Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Daming Mountains of China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, unbranched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower spike bearing a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinct lip. It thrives in cool, moist forest understories and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
