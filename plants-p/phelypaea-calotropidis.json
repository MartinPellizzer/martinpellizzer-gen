    "intro": "Phelypaea calotropidis, commonly known as the tropical water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Phelypaea calotropidis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
