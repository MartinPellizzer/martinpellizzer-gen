    "intro": "Polypodium venustum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
