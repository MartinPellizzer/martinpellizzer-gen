    "intro": "Pterophylla bernardii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pterophylla bernardii thrives in indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
