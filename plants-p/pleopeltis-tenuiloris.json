    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleopeltis tenuilocys, commonly known as the slender-ribbed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture from the air. The fronds are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, which aids in water retention."
