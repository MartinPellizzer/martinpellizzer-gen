It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Pyrethrum fruticulosum is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
