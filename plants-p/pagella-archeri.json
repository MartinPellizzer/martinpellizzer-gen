    "intro": "Pagella archeri, commonly known as the mountain pagella, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
