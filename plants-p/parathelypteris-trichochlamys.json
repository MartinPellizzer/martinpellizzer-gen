    "intro": "Parathelypteris trichochlamys, commonly known as the hairy-fronded water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The botanical features of this fern make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and fern evolution."
