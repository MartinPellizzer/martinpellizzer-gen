    "intro": "Pitcairnia tympani, commonly known as the Drummed Pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Pitcairnia tympani is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
