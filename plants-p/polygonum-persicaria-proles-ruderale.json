It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. It is often found in disturbed soils and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
