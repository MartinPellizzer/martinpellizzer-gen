    "intro": "Plocoglottis lowii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a tall, slender tree fern with a straight trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, hollow stem covered in a thick layer of dead fronds that provide structural support. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
