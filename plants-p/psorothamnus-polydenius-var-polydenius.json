It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and small, often grayish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its foliage and flowers provide habitat and nectar for various pollinators, making it an important species in its ecosystem."
