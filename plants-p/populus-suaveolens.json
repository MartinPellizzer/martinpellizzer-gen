    "intro": "Populus suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that emits a vanilla-like scent. The tree produces catkins and small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture and musical instrument manufacturing. Populus suaveolens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
