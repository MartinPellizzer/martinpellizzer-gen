    "intro": "Pterolobium, commonly known as the African senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various parts of Africa and are characterized by their compound leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. Many species of Pterolobium are shrubs or small trees, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. They play an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which enriches the surrounding environment. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value."
