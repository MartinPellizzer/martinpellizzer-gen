    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to wetlands and meadows in North America. It features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces a dense, fragrant spike of white to pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. It blooms from June to August and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
