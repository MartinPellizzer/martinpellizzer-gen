    "intro": "Platantheroides latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. The flower is small, white or pale green, and lacks a distinct lip, which is characteristic of the twayblade genus. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake and is often found in association with specific fungal species."
