    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa water milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
