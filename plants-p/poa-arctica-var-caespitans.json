    "intro": "Poa arctica var. caespitans, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures, including small spikelets, are typically found at the tips of the stems. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats."
