It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
