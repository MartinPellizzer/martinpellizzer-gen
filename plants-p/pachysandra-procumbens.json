    "intro": "Pachysandra procumbens, commonly known as broadleaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are broad and leathery. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and maintain a neat appearance. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded areas."
