    "intro": "Psidium itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange berries. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and a tendency to grow in dense, shaded undergrowth. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, though it is less commonly consumed than other guava species. The species is also noted for its adaptability to moist, humid environments."
