    "intro": "Portula nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
