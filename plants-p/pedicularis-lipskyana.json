    "intro": "Pedicularis lipskyana, commonly known as the Liskay's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. The leaves are fleshy and often arranged in a whorled pattern, adapting to its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
