    "intro": "Paspalum platyculmum, commonly known as the flat-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum platyculmum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
