    "intro": "Pyrus crastina, commonly known as the late-blooming pear, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its showy white flowers that appear later in the season than most other pear species. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. Pyrus crastina is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in horticulture."
