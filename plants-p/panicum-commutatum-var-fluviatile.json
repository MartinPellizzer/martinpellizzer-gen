    "intro": "Panicum commutatum var. fluviatile, commonly known as river dropseed, is a perennial grass native to wetlands and riparian areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often coated with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to golden seed heads that appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland landscapes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is adapted to periodic flooding, making it an important species for stabilizing riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects and wetland conservation efforts."
