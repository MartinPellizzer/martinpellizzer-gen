It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, waxy leaves with striking red veins. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic in shape and can vary in color from deep green to reddish hues. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
