    "intro": "Prosopis astringens, commonly known as the Brazilian mesquite, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the genus Prosopis, which includes several species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its small, yellowish flowers. It produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
