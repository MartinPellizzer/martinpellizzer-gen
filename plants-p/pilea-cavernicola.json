    "intro": "Pilea cavernicola, commonly known as the cave pilea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Pilea cavernicola is a popular houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
