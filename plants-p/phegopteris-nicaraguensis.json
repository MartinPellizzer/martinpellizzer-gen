    "intro": "Phegopteris nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in humid forests. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in its identification."
