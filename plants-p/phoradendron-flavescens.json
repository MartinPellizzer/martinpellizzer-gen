    "intro": "Phoradendron flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees."
