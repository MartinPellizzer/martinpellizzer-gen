    "intro": "Polypodium crassifolium f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib and serrated margins. This fern is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
