    "intro": "Polypodium stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
