    "intro": "Panicum dumus, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing panicles that are often white or light brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit and decorative seed heads make it a popular choice for erosion control and decorative planting."
