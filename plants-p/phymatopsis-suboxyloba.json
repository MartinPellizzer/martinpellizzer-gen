    "intro": "Phymatopsis suboxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed phymatopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
