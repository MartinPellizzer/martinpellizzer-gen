    "intro": "Peristylus spiranthes, commonly known as the spiral spikeflower, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in wetland and swamp habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem that bears a dense cluster of spirally arranged, white to pale pink flowers. Its unique floral structure, with overlapping petals and sepals, resembles a spiral, giving it its common name. Peristylus spiranthes is often found in moist, sandy soils and is a notable component of the wetland flora in its native range."
