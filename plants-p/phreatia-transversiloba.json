    "intro": "Phreatia transversiloba, commonly known as the Transverse Lipstick Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence with pale pink or white flowers that have a distinctive, lip-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are often found in symbiotic association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid's morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light environment, with broad, strap-like leaves that help retain moisture."
