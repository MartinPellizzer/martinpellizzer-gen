    "intro": "Pachycarpus firmus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the rainy season, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Pachycarpus firmus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
