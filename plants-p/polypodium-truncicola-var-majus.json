    "intro": "Polypodium truncicola var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, exhibiting an epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive truncate or notched base, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
