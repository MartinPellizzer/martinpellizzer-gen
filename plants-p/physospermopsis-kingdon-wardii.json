    "intro": "Physospermopsis kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward's physospermopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
