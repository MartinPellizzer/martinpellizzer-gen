It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum mulunense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
