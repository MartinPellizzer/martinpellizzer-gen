    "intro": "Pachycereus tepamo, commonly known as the Tepaneca cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are relatively short and are often covered in a white, waxy coating. This species is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
