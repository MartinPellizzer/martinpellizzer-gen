    "intro": "Paullinia quercifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or Brazilian oak, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of an oak, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Paullinia quercifolia is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Its wood is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins."
