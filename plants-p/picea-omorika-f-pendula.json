    "intro": "Picea omorika f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Serbian fir, is a unique variant of the Serbian fir, characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a cascading appearance. This coniferous tree is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters, though it often remains more compact in cultivation. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and emit a pleasant resinous scent. It is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for temperate climates."
