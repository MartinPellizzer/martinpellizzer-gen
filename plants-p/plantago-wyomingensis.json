    "intro": "Plantago wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This hardy plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
