    "intro": "Phaius rosellus, commonly known as the Rosell's ginger, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy forests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Phaius rosellus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts worldwide."
