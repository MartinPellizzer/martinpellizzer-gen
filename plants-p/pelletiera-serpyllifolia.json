    "intro": "Pelletiera serpyllifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial shrub that produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, black seeds. Pelletiera serpyllifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
