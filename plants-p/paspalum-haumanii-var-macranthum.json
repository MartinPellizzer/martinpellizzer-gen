It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers, which are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
