    "intro": "Pterostylis tristis, commonly known as the weeping greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, pendant greenish-white flower. Its unique floral structure includes a labellum that resembles a hood, which is characteristic of the Pterostylis genus. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
