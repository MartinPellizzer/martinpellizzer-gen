    "intro": "Pilosella apatelia subsp. altenbergensis, commonly known as the altenbergensis false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its low-growing habit and distinctive leaf morphology. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its native range."
