    "intro": "Pinus strobus f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant white pine, is a naturally occurring variant of the eastern white pine. It exhibits a unique growth habit characterized by dense, interlocking branches that form a broad, umbrella-like canopy. This feature allows it to thrive in shaded environments where typical white pines would struggle. The foliage is similar to that of the standard white pine, with long, slender needles. It is often found in forest understories, contributing to the ecological diversity of mixed hardwood-conifer forests."
