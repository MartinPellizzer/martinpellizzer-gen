    "intro": "Plantago australis subsp. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and swampy areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
