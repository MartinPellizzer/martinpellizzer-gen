    "intro": "Potentilla eriocarpa var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
