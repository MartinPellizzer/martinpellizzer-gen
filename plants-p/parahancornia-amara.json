    "intro": "Parahancornia amara, commonly known as the desert huito, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that is edible but has a bitter taste. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Parahancornia amara is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous communities."
