It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in groups of five, giving it its common name. Its leaves are compound, with five oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
