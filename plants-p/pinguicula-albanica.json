    "intro": "Pinguicula albanica, commonly known as the Albanian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, often appearing in clusters. Pinguicula albanica is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
