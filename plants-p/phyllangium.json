    "intro": "Phyllangium, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is known for its ability to filter water naturally. Its fronds are typically bright green with a golden hue, making it a visually striking addition to water gardens. Phyllangium is often used in bioremediation due to its capacity to absorb pollutants from the water."
