    "intro": "Polycnemum diandrum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Polycnemum diandrum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
