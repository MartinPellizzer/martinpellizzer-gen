    "intro": "Potentilla monanthes, commonly known as the single-flowered cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
