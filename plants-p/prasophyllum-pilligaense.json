    "intro": "Prasophyllum pilligaense, commonly known as the Pilliga orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Pilliga Forest in New South Wales, Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single stem that produces a single flower, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. It blooms during the spring and early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
