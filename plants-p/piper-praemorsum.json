    "intro": "Piper praemorsum, commonly known as the poison pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by bright red berries that contain the seeds. The plant has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use."
