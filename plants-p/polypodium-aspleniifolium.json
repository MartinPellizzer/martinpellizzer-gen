    "intro": "Polypodium aspleniifolium, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of polypody that is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name. Its leaves are leathery, dark green, and often have a slightly curled appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
