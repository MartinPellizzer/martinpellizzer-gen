    "intro": "Pleurothallis sandaliorum, commonly known as the sandalwood orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Pleurothallis sandaliorum is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests."
