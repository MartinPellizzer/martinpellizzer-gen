    "intro": "Pyrus flagellata, commonly known as the weeping sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that bear clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Pyrus flagellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and seasonal blooms."
