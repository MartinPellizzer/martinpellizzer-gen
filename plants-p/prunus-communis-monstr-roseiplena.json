    "intro": "Prunus communis monstr. roseiplena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that resemble small roses, giving it its name. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a sweet, fragrant aroma. The fruit is a small, tart cherry that ripens in late summer, though it is often not suitable for eating."
