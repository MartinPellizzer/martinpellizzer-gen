    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves with glandular dots, which give it its specific epithet \"glandulosa.\" The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. This variety is notable for its compact form and ornamental value in horticultural landscapes."
