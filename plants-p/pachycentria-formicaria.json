    "intro": "Pachycentria formicaria, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species of flowering plant that exhibits a symbiotic relationship with ants. Its specialized structures, called domatia, provide shelter for ant colonies, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is adapted to grow in sandy soils. This mutualistic relationship is a key feature of its ecological niche and botanical significance."
