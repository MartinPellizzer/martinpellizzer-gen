It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. Its aromatic resin, known as mastic, has been used historically for medicinal and culinary purposes. The species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can tolerate coastal conditions."
