    "intro": "Polyscias macrantha, commonly known as the large-leaf sycamore, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Polyscias macrantha is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
