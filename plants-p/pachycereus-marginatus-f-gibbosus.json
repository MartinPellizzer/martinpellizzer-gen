    "intro": "Pachycereus marginatus f. gibbosus, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a distinctive columnar cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant features prominent areoles with spines and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its fleshy stems and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation. This variety is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
