    "intro": "Psychotria fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Psychotria fraseri is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and undergrowth."
