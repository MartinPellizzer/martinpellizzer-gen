    "intro": "Polystachya fulvilabia, commonly known as the golden-lipped bower vine, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow lips on the petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
