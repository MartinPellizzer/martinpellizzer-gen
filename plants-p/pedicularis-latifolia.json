    "intro": "Pedicularis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling orchids. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
