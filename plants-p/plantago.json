    "intro": "Plantago, commonly known as plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It consists of over 200 species, most of which are herbaceous and native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is characterized by its broad, ribbed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically grow in dense clusters. Many species are used in traditional medicine for their mucilage-rich leaves, which have soothing properties. Additionally, some varieties are cultivated as ornamental plants or used in herbal remedies."
