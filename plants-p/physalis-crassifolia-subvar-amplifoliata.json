    "intro": "Physalis crassifolia subvar. amplifoliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved husk tomato, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy calyces that enclose the fruit, which resembles a small, orange tomato. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, inflated fruit. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a tart, tangy flavor."
