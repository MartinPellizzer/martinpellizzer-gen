It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. Peristeria species are succulent plants with thick, fleshy stems and leaves, adapted to arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their dramatic, short-lived blooms."
