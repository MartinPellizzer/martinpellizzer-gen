    "intro": "Potentilla stenophylla var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, compact growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with sunny, dry conditions."
