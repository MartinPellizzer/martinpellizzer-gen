It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
