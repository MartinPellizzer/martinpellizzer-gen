    "intro": "Polystichum transvaalense, commonly known as the Transvaal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often curled and clustered in groups. Polystichum transvaalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, architectural form."
