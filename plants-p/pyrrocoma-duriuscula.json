    "intro": "Pyrrocoma duriuscula, commonly known as the rough pygmy broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in a rough, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Pyrrocoma duriuscula is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
