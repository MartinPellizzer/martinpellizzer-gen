    "intro": "Plantago pusilla f. major, commonly known as the giant plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to spread through rhizomes."
