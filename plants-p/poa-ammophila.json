    "intro": "Poa ammophila, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is well adapted to sandy and saline environments, often growing on dunes and coastal plains. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its extensive root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Poa ammophila plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
