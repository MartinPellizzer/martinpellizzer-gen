    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on moist, shaded soils, often found in woodland edges and grassy areas. The plant has slender, leafy stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
