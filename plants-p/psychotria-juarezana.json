It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. Psychotria juarezana is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
