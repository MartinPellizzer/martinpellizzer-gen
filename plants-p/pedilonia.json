    "intro": "Pedilonia, commonly known as the \"twin-flowered\" or \"double-flowered\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lipped flowers, often with a striking color contrast between the upper and lower lips. The genus includes several species, such as Pedilonia tetraphylla, which is native to parts of Asia and features showy, bilaterally symmetrical blooms. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
