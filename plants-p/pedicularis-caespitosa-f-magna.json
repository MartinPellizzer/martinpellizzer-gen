It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, boggy habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is known for its robust growth and is often found in dense clusters, giving it its \"caespitosa\" (meaning \"tufted\") common name."
