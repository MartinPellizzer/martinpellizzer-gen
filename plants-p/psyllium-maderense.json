    "intro": "Psyllium maderense, commonly known as the Maderan psyllium, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of its genus. Its seeds are encased in a mucilaginous coating, which becomes gel-like when soaked in water. Psyllium maderense is primarily valued for its potential medicinal properties and as a source of dietary fiber."
