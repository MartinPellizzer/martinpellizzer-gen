    "intro": "Pinus sabiniana, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a coniferous tree native to California and parts of Oregon. It is characterized by its distinctive short, twisted branches and its unique cone structure, which has a knob-like projection at the base. The tree produces small, dark green needles that are arranged in bundles of five. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The knobcone pine plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
