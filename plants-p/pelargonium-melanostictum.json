    "intro": "Pelargonium melanostictum, commonly known as the African waxleaf geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Pelargonium melanostictum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
