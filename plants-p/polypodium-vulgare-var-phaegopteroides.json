    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. phaegopteroides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically golden-green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
