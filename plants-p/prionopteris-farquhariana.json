It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its strap-like, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
