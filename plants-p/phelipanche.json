    "intro": "Phelipanche, commonly known as common morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Phelipanche species are often considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. The seeds of these plants can remain viable in the soil for many years, making them a persistent challenge in agricultural settings."
