    "intro": "Primula elatior var. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of tubular, violet to blue flowers. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its shorter, more compact floral stems compared to other primula species. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
