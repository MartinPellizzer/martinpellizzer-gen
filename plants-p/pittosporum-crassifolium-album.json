    "intro": "Pittosporum crassifolium album, commonly known as the white-flowered pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green, and its showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and floral display."
