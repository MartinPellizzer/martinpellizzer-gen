    "intro": "Poincianella glandulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf poinciana, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
