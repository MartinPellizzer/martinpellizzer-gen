    "intro": "Peperomia kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu peperomia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in moist, rocky areas within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
