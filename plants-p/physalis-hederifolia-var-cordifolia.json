    "intro": "Physalis hederifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf winter cherry, is a variant of the winter cherry plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, orange berries that are enclosed in a papery calyx, a feature common to many species in the Physalis genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though the berries are typically too tart for direct consumption."
