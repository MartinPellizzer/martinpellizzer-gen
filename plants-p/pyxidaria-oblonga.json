    "intro": "Pyxidaria oblonga, commonly known as the oblong boxwood, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a hedge or topiary plant."
