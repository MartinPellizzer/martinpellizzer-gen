    "intro": "Platanthera convallariifolia, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem bearing lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
