    "intro": "Polypodium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fern produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
