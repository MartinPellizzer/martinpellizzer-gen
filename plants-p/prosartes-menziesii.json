    "intro": "Prosartes menziesii, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a perennial fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, sword-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
