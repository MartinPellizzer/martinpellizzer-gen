It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
