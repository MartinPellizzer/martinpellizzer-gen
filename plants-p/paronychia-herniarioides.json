    "intro": "Paronychia herniarioides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose, sandy soils. Paronychia herniarioides is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
