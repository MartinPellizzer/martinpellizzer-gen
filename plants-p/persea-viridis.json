    "intro": "Persea viridis, commonly known as the green spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, round fruits that are green when mature. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp containing several seeds. It is often grown for its ornamental value and for the edible fruit used in local cuisines."
