    "intro": "Poaephyllum hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its restricted habitat, Poaephyllum hansenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
