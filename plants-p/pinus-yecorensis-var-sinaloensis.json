    "intro": "Pinus yecorensis var. sinaloensis, commonly known as the Sinaloan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Madre mountains in western Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often pendulous and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
