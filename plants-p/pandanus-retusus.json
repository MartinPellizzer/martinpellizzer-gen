    "intro": "Pandanus retusus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of spiky, fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts and construction. Pandanus retusus is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a resilient species in tropical climates."
