    "intro": "Polemonium crassifolium, commonly known as showy lady's slippers, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive pouch-like structure resembling a slipper. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often crassifoliate, meaning they are thick and leathery. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Polemonium crassifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
