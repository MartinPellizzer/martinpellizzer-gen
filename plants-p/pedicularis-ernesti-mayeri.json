    "intro": "Pedicularis ernesti-mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often resembling the appearance of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
