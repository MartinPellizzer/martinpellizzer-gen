    "intro": "Pinus fenzeliana subsp. annamiensis, commonly known as the Annamite pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this subspecies are small and often persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in mixed forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
