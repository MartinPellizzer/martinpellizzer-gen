    "intro": "Potentilla atrosanguinea, commonly known as blackstem cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark purple stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five elliptical leaflets, and the plant is often found in open, dry habitats. Potentilla atrosanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
