    "intro": "Paeonia officinalis subsp. villosa, commonly known as the downy peony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces thick, fleshy rhizomes that serve as storage organs and help it survive in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
