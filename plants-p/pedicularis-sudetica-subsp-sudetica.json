    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica subsp. sudetica, commonly known as the Carpathian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
