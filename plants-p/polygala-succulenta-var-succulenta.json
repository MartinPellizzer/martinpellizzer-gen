It features narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
