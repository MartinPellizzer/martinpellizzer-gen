    "intro": "Phthirusa rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated phthirus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous leaves and clusters of delicate, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical species."
