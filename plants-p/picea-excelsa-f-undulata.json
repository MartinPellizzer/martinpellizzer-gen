    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. undulata, commonly known as the undulating white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive undulating or wavy bark, which gives it a unique appearance compared to typical white spruce. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed, contributing to its compact growth habit. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
