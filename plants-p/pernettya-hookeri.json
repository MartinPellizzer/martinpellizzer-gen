    "intro": "Pernettya hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of southern South America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are elliptical, dark green, and glossy, with a leathery texture. Its fruits are red berries that mature in late summer and are edible, though often tart. Pernettya hookeri thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other understory plants in temperate rainforests."
