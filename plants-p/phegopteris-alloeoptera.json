    "intro": "Phegopteris alloeoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into small, narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Phegopteris alloeoptera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
