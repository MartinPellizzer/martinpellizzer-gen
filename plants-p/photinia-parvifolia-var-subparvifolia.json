    "intro": "Photinia parvifolia var. subparvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved firethorn, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are small and oval in shape, providing a dense, attractive foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance."
