It features slender, upright culms covered in dense, grass-like foliage that turns a striking silver-green color in full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Pennisetum viride is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to add texture and movement to garden designs."
