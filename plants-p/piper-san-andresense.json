    "intro": "Piper san-andresense, commonly known as San Andres pepper vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly the island of San Andr\u00e9s in the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by berries that turn red when mature. Piper san-andresense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and unique appearance."
