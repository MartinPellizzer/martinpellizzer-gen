It features oval, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
