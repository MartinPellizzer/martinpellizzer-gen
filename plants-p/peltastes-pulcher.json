    "intro": "Peltastes pulcher, commonly known as the beautiful peltastes, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to bright orange. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Peltastes pulcher is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
