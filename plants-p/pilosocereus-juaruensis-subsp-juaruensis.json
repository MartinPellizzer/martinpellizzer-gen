    "intro": "Pilosocereus juaruensis subsp. juaruensis, commonly known as the Juaru cactus, is a species native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in northern Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. It produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
