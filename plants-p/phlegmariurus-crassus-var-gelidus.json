It is characterized by its dark green, wiry stems and closely appressed leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. This variety is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in high-altitude and polar regions. Its spore-producing capsules are urn-shaped and often covered with a persistent calyptra. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, making it an important component of alpine and Antarctic ecosystems."
