    "intro": "Panicum kerstingii, commonly known as Kersting's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Kersting's panicgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
