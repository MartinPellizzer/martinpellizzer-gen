    "intro": "Penstemon jamesii subsp. breviculus, commonly known as the short-stem penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as foothills and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
