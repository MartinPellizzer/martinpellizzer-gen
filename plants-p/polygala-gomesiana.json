It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually small and linear, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
