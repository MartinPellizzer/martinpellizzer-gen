    "intro": "Poterium dictyocarpum, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a complex network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, ovate leaves. Poterium dictyocarpum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
