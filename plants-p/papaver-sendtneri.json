    "intro": "Papaver sendtneri, commonly known as the Sendtner's poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle bluish tinge. The plant produces a slender, branching stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
