    "intro": "Persicaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink or reddish petals, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Persicaria prostrata is often found in moist soils, such as along stream banks or in wet meadows."
