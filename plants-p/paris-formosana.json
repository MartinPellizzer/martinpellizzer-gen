    "intro": "Paris formosana, commonly known as the Formosan lady's tresses, is a rare orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in a loose, loose raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
