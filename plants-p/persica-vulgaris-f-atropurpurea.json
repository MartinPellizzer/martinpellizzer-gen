    "intro": "Persica vulgaris f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its striking purple foliage. The leaves are typically a deep purplish-red, especially when exposed to full sun, while the flowers are white with a slight pink tinge. It produces small, sweet fruits similar to standard peaches, though the fruit size is generally smaller. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value due to its vibrant leaf color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal fruit production."
