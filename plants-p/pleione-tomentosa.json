    "intro": "Pleione tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen pseudobulbs and large, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique ability to survive in cold, shaded environments, making it a hardy species for cultivation in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that store moisture, aiding in its survival during dry periods. The wooly covering on its stems and leaves gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance."
