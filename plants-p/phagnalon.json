    "intro": "Phagnalon, commonly known as field scabious, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These plants are typically found in meadows, grasslands, and other open habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. They are characterized by their showy, often purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Phagnalon species are perennial herbs with opposite leaves and often have a hairy texture. The genus includes several species, such as Phagnalon saxatile and Phagnalon ramosum, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
