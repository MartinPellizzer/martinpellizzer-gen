    "intro": "Potentilla psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit and a system of rhizomes that help it survive in harsh conditions. Potentilla psilophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and floral display."
