It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Polyactium plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
