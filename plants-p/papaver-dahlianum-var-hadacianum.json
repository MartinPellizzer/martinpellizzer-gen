    "intro": "Papaver dahlianum var. hadacianum, commonly known as the Hadacian poppy, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive, narrow, elongated corona. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
