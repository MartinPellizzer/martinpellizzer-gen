    "intro": "Pyrus amphigenea costata, commonly known as the costate pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive ribbed or costate leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
