It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Pombalia velutina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
