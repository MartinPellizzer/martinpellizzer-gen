    "intro": "Psychotria melanocarpa, commonly known as the black ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, elliptical leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its striking appearance and psychoactive properties, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and studied for its chemical composition."
