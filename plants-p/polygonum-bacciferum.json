    "intro": "Polygonum bacciferum, commonly known as the black nightshade or red-rooted polygonum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. Its berries are dark purple to black when mature and are edible, though they contain solanine, making them potentially toxic in large quantities. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
