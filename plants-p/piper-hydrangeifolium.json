    "intro": "Piper hydrangeifolium, commonly known as the hydrangea-leaved pepper, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of hydrangeas, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for their purported health benefits."
