    "intro": "Pleurothallis bothros, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
