    "intro": "[WRONG START] parablechnum rheophyticum, commonly known as the water lily of the highlands, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in moist, rocky environments. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are often anchored in crevices, allowing it to thrive in areas with limited soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
