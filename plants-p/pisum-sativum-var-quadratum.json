    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. quadratum, commonly known as the four-angled pea, is a variant of the common pea characterized by its square-shaped pods. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its pods are unique in their four-angled structure, which distinguishes it from other pea varieties. The seeds are edible and can be used in similar ways to standard peas, though they are less commonly cultivated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in agricultural systems."
