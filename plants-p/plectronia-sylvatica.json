    "intro": "Plectronia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland plectronia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Plectronia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators during the spring season."
