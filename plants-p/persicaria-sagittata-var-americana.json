    "intro": "Persicaria sagittata var. americana, commonly known as American arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
