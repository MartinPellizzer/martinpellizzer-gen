    "intro": "Potentilla ternata var. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically narrow and rounded at the tips, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
