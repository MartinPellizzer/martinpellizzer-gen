    "intro": "Pyrus fusca var. levipes, commonly known as the slender sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
