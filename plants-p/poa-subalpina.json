    "intro": "Poa subalpina, commonly known as Alpine Bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, blue-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. This plant is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates. Poa subalpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil structure."
