    "intro": "Polystichum quadrangulare, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance. Polystichum quadrangulare thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
