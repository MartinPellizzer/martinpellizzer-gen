    "intro": "Phalaenopsis schilleriana var. major, commonly known as the Schiller's phalaenopsis, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its prolonged blooming period."
